# Spellcasting

# Knowing and Preparing Spells

Before it may be cast, a spell must be known (learned and conceptually understood) and prepared (memorized in detail in a ready-to-cast form). Each spellcasting class has a different approach to learning and preparing spells.  
Some character classes, such as clerics, druids, and heralds, know most spells which are available to their class, and choose a subset of those spells to prepare at any given time.  
Other classes, such as bards and sorcerers, choose a small set of spells which they know, each of which is always prepared. They can only know a fixed number of spells at any level.  
Wizards maintain a large and ever-growing collection of known spells, of which they have a certain number prepared at any time. Wizards can learn any number of new spells without giving up old ones; the only limit is the scarcity of magical scrolls and spellbooks to copy.

## Rare Spells

Many spellcasters leave their mark on the world by individualizing their spells. Some of these unique spells have been lost to antiquity, but a few are preserved in ancient scrolls.  
Some spell descriptions include one or more rare versions of the spell. A rare spell is a little-known variant of an existing spell which offers a change or improvement to the spell’s functionality. It’s usually named after its creator. The Narrator determines which, if any, rare spells are available to discover or research.  
A rare spell can’t be chosen when selecting new spells at character creation or when gaining a level—it is obtained on a specially-scribed scroll or learned through costly research. When a character acquires a scroll bearing a rare version of a spell, they may spend a long rest to learn it if it is on their spell list. Doing so destroys the scroll. Alternatively, with the Narrator’s assistance, a player can use the Research downtime activity to invent or reinvent rare spells. For classes which only know a limited number of spells, a rare spell does not count against their number of spells known. For classes which prepare a limited number of spells, this spell must be prepared separately.

# Casting Spells

As spellcasters advance in character level, they gain the ability to prepare and cast more powerful spells.  
A spell’s level determines the amount of mental energy the spellcaster must expend to cast the spell. Spells are ranked in complexity and power from level 0 to 9\. 0th-level spells, also called cantrips, can be cast effortlessly. Other spells require an investment of energy, and can only be cast a limited number of times between rests. The most complex and powerful spells, 9th-level spells, can only be employed by the mightiest spellcasters, and generally only once per long rest.

## Spell Slots

Most spellcasting classes’ reserves of magical energy are represented by a number of spell slots, each of which has a spell level. More and higher-level spell slots become available as a character gains experience in a spellcasting class. A spell slot is expended when a character casts a spell at that spell level. When all the slots of a given spell level have been used, the character can no longer cast spells at that spell level. Taking a long rest restores all spell slots.

## Casting Spells With a Higher Slot

A spell can be cast as a higher-level spell if there is a higher-level spell slot available to spend.   
Some spells have more powerful effects when cast using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, *cure wounds* restore more hit points when cast as a 2nd-level spell. Such benefits apply to both the normal version of a spell and any rare variant.  
When casting a spell using a higher-level spell slot that the spell provides no benefits for, you gain the benefits for casting at the highest-level spell slot that qualifies.

## Casting Spells Without Slots

Some magic items allow characters to cast certain spells without expending spell slots.   
A magical spell scroll allows a character to cast a single spell, if the spell is on the character’s spell list. After the spell is cast, the scroll loses its magic. A character who uses a magical scroll can cast it at a higher level, or even cast a spell of a higher level than the character can normally cast, by making an ability check, using their spellcasting ability against a DC of 10 \+ the level at which they cast the spell. On a failure, the scroll loses its magic. A character may increase the spell’s casting time by 12 hours in a magical stronghold appropriate to their class, such as a wizard’s tower or a cleric’s temple. If they do so, they gain a bonus to their spellcasting ability check equal to the grade of the stronghold.  
Character abilities granted by class or heritage may also grant the innate ability to cast spells without using spell slots.

## Cantrips

0th-level spells (cantrips) don’t require spell slots to cast, and can be cast any number of times per day. Cantrips don’t need to be prepared. A spellcasting class’ description indicates how many cantrips a character knows at any given level.

## Rituals

Certain spells can be cast as a ritual. Such spells have a special tag, Ritual, listed on the same line as the spell’s casting time.  
If a character has a Ritual Spellcasting feature, they can choose to cast such a spell either normally or as a ritual. If they choose to cast it as a ritual, they do so without expending a spell slot. Casting the spell in this way takes an extra 10 minutes to cast. A spell cast as a ritual can’t be cast as a higher-level spell.  
Most characters must have a spell prepared in order to cast it as a ritual, though wizards can cast any known spell as a ritual.

## Casting Spells in Armor

A spellcaster can’t cast spells while wearing armor in which they’re not proficient.

# Spell Descriptions

Each spell begins with a block of rules information specifying the spell’s name, spell school, tags, casting time, range, components, and duration. Some spells may also include an entry for target, area, and saving throw. A description of the spell follows the spell block.

# Classical Spell Schools

Every spell belongs to one or more schools of magic. These schools include 8 classical schools of magic, as defined by mages long past and handed down in formal tradition. Each classical school represents a different type of magical energy being channeled, and a spell can only belong to one classical school. A magical effect’s school is usually detectable by effects such as *detect magic*.  
**Abjuration** spells involve the forces of protection and warding. *Shield* is an abjuration spell.  
**Conjuration** spells cause objects to be teleported or summoned. *Find familiar* is a Conjuration spell.  
**Divination** spells provide information and uncover secrets. *Detect magic* is a Divination spell.  
**Enchantment** spells twist the mind. *Charm person* is an Enchantment spell.  
**Evocation** spells call forth magical energy. *Cure wounds* and *magic missile* are evocation spells.  
**Illusion** spells create false sensory impressions. *Silent image* is an illusion spell.  
**Necromancy** spells deal with the power of death. *Inflict wounds* is a necromancy spell.  
**Transmutation** spells transform or change their subjects, or grant a creature new abilities. *Jump* is a transmutation spell.

## Other Spell Schools

The formal, classical spell schools are not the only way magic-users throughout the ages have labeled spells. In the multiverse there is a near-infinite array of spell schools; some are based on elemental sources (like beasts, fire, plants, shadow, water, and so on), while others are based on effects (compulsion, healing, and more). While a spell can belong to only one classical spell school, it can belong to any number of other spell schools. These spell schools have no rules of their own, but may be referred to by other game rules. For instance, a monster’s description might state that it can cast any spell in the fire school.  
This book contains spells using the following schools: acid, affliction, air, arcane, attack, beasts, chaos, cold, communication, compulsion, divine, earth, enhancement, evil, fear, fire, force, good, healing, knowledge, law, lightning, movement, nature, necrotic, negation, obscurement, planar, plants, poison, prismatic, protection, psychic, radiant, scrying, senses, shadow, shapechanging, sound, storm, summoning, technological, telepathy, teleportation, terrain, thunder, time, transformation, unarmed, undead, utility, water, weaponry, weather.

## Casting Time

Most spells take one action to cast.  
Some spells are cast with a bonus action. A spellcaster can’t cast a spell as a bonus action on the same turn that they cast another spell, unless the second spell is a cantrip with a casting time of one action.  
Other spells use a reaction. This type of spell will describe the trigger that allows the spell to be cast.  
A few spells (and spells cast as rituals) have a longer casting time. A spellcaster must use their action every turn to maintain such a spell. Furthermore, they must concentrate on the spell (see below). Otherwise, the spell fails, and the spellcaster doesn’t expend a spell slot or any material components the spell requires.

### Rapid Summoning

Conjuration spells that summon powerful or extraplanar creatures take longer to enact, but by choosing to forge a more tenuous connection it’s possible to cast these more quickly than normal.  
When casting *conjure celestial, conjure elemental, conjure fey, conjure minor elementals*, or any other spell that conjures creatures and has a casting time of 1 minute, a spellcaster can choose to reduce the spell’s casting time to 1d4+1 actions and the spell’s duration to 1 minute. The spellcaster must maintain concentration on the casting each round, using an action on each of their turns until the casting is complete. At any time on their turn after the casting begins, the spellcaster may choose to abandon the rapid summoning to cast a different spell that has a casting time of 1 action and uses a spell slot of the same level or less.

## Range

A spell’s range is the maximum distance to its target or targets at the moment that the spell is cast. For some spells, the target is a creature or object. For other spells, the target is a point in space.  
Some spells have a range of Self, meaning that they only affect the spellcaster, or (for a spell that affects an area) that the point of origin of the spell is the spellcaster. Other spells have a range of Touch, meaning that they affect either the spellcaster or a target that they touch.  
Still other spells can only affect targets within a certain number of feet. Common distances include short range (30 feet or less), medium range (60 feet or less), or long range (120 feet or less). Some spells have much longer ranges, such as a mile or more, or are not limited by distance.

## Target

Some, but not all, spells have a target listed in the spell block. This type of spell operates on the specified type of creatures or objects within range. Unless the spell indicates otherwise, the spellcaster is a valid target of a spell which acts on a creature or creatures.  
Unless otherwise specified by the spell, there must be a clear path (no total cover) between the spellcaster and part of the target. If the target is an unwilling creature, the spellcaster must also be able to see it or otherwise know its precise location.

## Area

Some, but not all, spells have an area listed in the stat block. Anything within this area can be affected by the spell.  
Every area has a point of origin from which its effects radiate. The point of origin is determined by the spell’s range. If the spell’s range is Self, the point of origin is the spellcaster. If the point of origin is given as a distance, the point of origin can be anywhere within that distance. If there is no clear path between the spellcaster and the intended point of origin of the spell, the spell’s point of origin is on the near side of the obstruction blocking the path.  
For most spells, if there is no clear path between the point of origin and a location within the spell’s area, that location is not affected by the spell. Some spells specify that their effect travels around corners. In that case, a location is affected if a non-straight line from the location connects to the point of origin without leaving the spell’s area.  
Spell areas usually take one of five shapes: a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.  
A **cone** extends from its point of origin in a direction of the spellcaster’s choice, and need not include the origin. A cone’s maximum width is equal to its length.  
A **cube**’s point of origin can be anywhere on any face of the cube, and need not include the origin. A cube’s length is also its width and height.  
A **cylinder**’s point of origin is the center of the circle at the top or bottom of the cylinder. The bottom of the cylinder rests on the ground. A cylinder includes its point of origin.  
A **line** extends straight from its point of origin, and need not include its point of origin.  
A **sphere**’s point of origin is its center, and is included in its area. The sphere’s radius is the distance from its point of origin to any edge.

## Created Effects

Some spells have no target or area, but create or summon an object, creature, or effect within the spell’s range. Unless otherwise specified in the spell description, the spellcaster does not need to see the space where the object, creature, or effect will appear but there must be a clear path to the space; if there is no clear path, the spell will affect the space on the near side of the obstruction blocking the path.

## Components

The process of casting a spell requires the use of specific actions or objects, called components. These components may allow observers to recognize that a spell is being cast. A spell may include any of the following types of components:  
**Vocalized (V):** A spell with a vocalized component is apparent to creatures that can hear. A character under the effect of a *silence* spell or otherwise unable to make noise can’t cast a spell with a vocalized component.  
**Seen (S):** A spell with a seen component is apparent to creatures that can see. A spell cast with a seen component can’t be cast by an incapacitated creature or a creature that has its hands full with weapons (or a shield) that are not being used as a spell focus.  
**Material (M):** A spell with a material component lists a specific physical object which the spellcaster must provide. If no cost is specified for the object and it does not require part of the target, a character may substitute a component pouch or spellcasting focus (see Equipment). Some spells note that their material component is consumed as part of the casting. A spell cast with a material component requires that the caster hold the material component during the casting of the spell.

Even if a creature witnesses a spell being cast, the effect or even the target of the spell may not be obvious.

## Duration, Combination, and Concentration

A spell’s duration is how long it lasts. Many spells have an Instantaneous duration, meaning that their magic ends as the spell is cast, leaving the world changed in a way that can’t be undone with *dispel magic* or a similar effect.  
Other spells have durations of one round or longer. A creature, object, or area might be under the effect of two or more such spells at the same time. In most cases, the effects of both spells combine. However, multiple castings of the same spell don’t combine. When two versions of the same spells overlap, the most powerful effect applies.  
Some spells have a duration which includes concentration. Such a spell requires some level of focus and attention, although the spellcaster can perform most activities while concentrating on a spell. If this concentration ends, the spell ends prematurely.  
A spellcaster’s concentration can be ended by any of the following:

* The spellcaster chooses to end concentration at any time.  
* The spellcaster is incapacitated or killed.  
* The spellcaster successfully casts another spell that requires concentration.  
* The Narrator may rule that a sudden interruption, such as a push, may force the spellcaster to make a DC 10 Constitution check. On a failure, the spell ends.  
* If the spellcaster takes damage while concentrating on a spell, they must make a Constitution saving throw; on a failure, the spell ends. The DC is 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher.

## Saving Throw

If a spell allows an affected creature to make a saving throw, the saving throw ability score will be specified in the spell block. A creature may voluntarily fail a saving throw. Unless noted otherwise, objects always fail saving throws.  
Some spells deal half damage to a creature that succeeds on its saving throw. These spells have the word “halves” listed after the ability score used. For instance, “Dexterity halves” means an affected creature takes half damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.  
Other spells that aren’t as direct about their effects on a creature are marked as “special”. For instance, the flesh to stone spell is marked as “Constitution (special)” because it requires more than one saving throw that has staged effects for failed saves.  
The DC to resist a spell is 8 \+ the spellcaster’s spellcasting ability modifier \+ the spellcaster’s proficiency bonus.

## Attack Roll

Some spells require a successful attack roll to affect their target. This is specified in the spell’s description. Ranged and melee spell attacks follow all the rules for ranged and melee attacks.  
The attack bonus for a spell attack is the spellcaster’s spellcasting ability modifier \+ the spellcaster’s proficiency bonus.

Choose whether the alarm is silent or audible. The silent alarm is heard in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the target, and it awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces a loud, 10-second duration noise of your choosing that can be heard up to 60 feet away.  
***Cast at Higher Levels.*** You may create an additional alarm for each slot level above 1st. The spell’s range increases to 600 feet, but you must be familiar with the locations you ward, and all alarms must be set within the same physical structure.

*Greater Natural Weapons.* The damage dealt by your natural weapon increases to 2d6, and you gain a \+2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with your natural weapons.  
*Mask of the Grave.* You adopt the appearance of a skeleton or zombie (your choice). Your type changes to undead, and mindless undead creatures ignore your presence, treating you as one of their own. You don’t need to breathe and you become immune to poison.

**Target:** One non-celestial creature  
**Components:** V  
**Duration**: 7 days  
The target is bombarded with a fraction of energy stolen from some slumbering, deific source, immediately taking 40 radiant damage. This spell ignores resistances but does not ignore immunities. A creature killed by this spell does not decay and cannot become undead for the spell’s duration. Days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as *raise dead*. This effect ends early if the corpse takes necrotic damage.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage and duration increase to 45 radiant damage and 1 year when using an 8th-level spell slot, or 50 damage and until dispelled when using a 9th-level spell slot.

# Animal Friendship

*1st-level (enchantment; beasts, compulsion, nature)*

Until the spell ends or one of your companions harms it, the target is charmed by you.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** Choose one additional target for each slot level above 1st.

# Animal Messenger

*2nd-level (enchantment; beasts, communication, nature)*  
**Classes:** Bard, druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Tiny beast  
**Components:** V, S, M (tightly rolled strip of paper)  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
You whisper a message of 25 words or less to the target, along with directions to a location you have visited and a brief description of the message’s recipient.  
For the duration of the spell, the messenger travels towards the location at a rate of 50 miles per day for a messenger with a flying speed, or else 25 miles without.  
When the messenger arrives, it speaks in your voice, delivering your message to the first creature matching the description you provided. If the messenger can’t find the recipient or reach its destination before the spell ends, the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

**Rare: Indiscriminate Animal Messenger.** The spell can target any Tiny creature of Intelligence 3 or less.

# Animal Shapes

*8th-level (transmutation; beasts, shapechanging, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Any number of willing creatures you can see  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (24 hours)  
Each target transforms into a Large or smaller beast of your choice with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. Each target may have the same or a different form than other targets.  
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform targets into new forms, gaining new hit points when they do so.  
Until the spell ends or it is dropped to 0 hit points, the target’s game statistics (including its hit points) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast excepting its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can’t speak or cast spells. The target’s equipment melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form.  
When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell’s effect on the target ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

**Rare: Amorphous Animal Shapes.** You may transform the targets into Large or smaller oozes of Challenge Rating 4 or lower.

# Animate Dead

*3rd-level (necromancy; necrotic, summoning, undead)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** Corpse or pile of bones of a Medium or Small creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (two copper coins)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You animate a mortal’s remains to become your undead servant.  
If the spell is cast upon bones you create a skeleton, and if cast upon a corpse you can choose to create a skeleton or a zombie. The Narrator has the undead’s statistics.  
While it is within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command any undead you created with this spell. When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the creature’s exact action and move, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area, which it follows until the task is complete or you issue it a new command. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself.   
The undead is under your control for 24 hours unless you cast this spell on it before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours. Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 4 of your previously-animated undead instead of animating a new one. When no longer under your control, the undead no longer obeys your commands.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You create or maintain control over 2 additional undead for each slot level above 3rd. When commanding more than 3 undead they make group attack rolls (see Combat).

**Rare: Chilling Animate Dead.** Natural weapon attacks by undead created using this spell deal cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

# Animate Objects

*5th-level (transmutation; arcane, transformation, weaponry)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Target:** Up to six unattended nonmagical objects  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
Choose up to 6 unattended nonmagical Small or Tiny objects. You may also choose larger objects; treat Medium objects as 2 objects, Large objects as 3 objects, and Huge objects as 6 objects.  
Until the spell ends or a target is reduced to 0 hit points, you animate the targets and turn them into constructs under your control.  
Each construct has Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1, as well as a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover (if securely fastened to something larger, it has a Speed of 0), and blindsight to a range of 30 feet (blind beyond that distance). Otherwise a construct’s statistics are determined by its size.  
If you animate 4 or more Small or Tiny objects, instead of controlling each construct individually they function as a construct swarm. Add together all swarm’s total hit points. Attacks against a construct swarm deal half damage. The construct swarm reverts to individual constructs when it is reduced to 15 hit points or less.  
You can use a bonus action to mentally command any construct made with this spell while within 500 feet of it. When you command multiple constructs using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the creature’s exact action and move, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area, which it follows until the task is complete or you issue it a new command. If not given a command, the construct only defends itself.   
When you command a construct to attack, it makes a slam, a melee attack, against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit the construct deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage appropriate to its shape.  
When the construct drops to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its inanimate object form.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You can animate 2 additional Small or Tiny objects for each slot level above 5th.

**TABLE: ANIMATE OBJECTS**

| SIZE | HP | AC | ATTACK | STR | DEX |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---- | :---: | :---: |
| Tiny | 5 | 14 | \+6 to hit, 1d4 – 3 damage | 4 | 18 |
| Small | 10 | 12 | \+4 to hit, 1d6 – 2 damage | 6 | 14 |
| Swarm of Tiny and Small | varies | 13 | \+5 to hit, 2d6 damage (1d6 damage if bloodied) | 5 | 16 |

| Large | 40 | 10 | \+4 to hit, 2d8 \+ 2 damage | 14 | 10 |
| Huge | 80 | 8 | \+6 to hit, 2d12 \+ 4 damage | 18 | 6 |

# Antilife Shell

*5h-level (abjuration; protection, technological, undead)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** 10-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
A translucent barrier pops into existence around you. The barrier moves with you and prevents creatures other than undead and constructs from passing or reaching through its surface.  
The barrier does not prevent spells or attacks with ranged or reach weapons from passing through the barrier.  
The spell ends if you move so that a living creature is forced to pass through the barrier.

**Rare: Repelling Antilife Shell.** When the spell would force a living creature to pass through the barrier, that creature is harmlessly pushed back into a space of its choosing outside of the sphere and within 5 feet of its original position.

# Antimagic Field

*8th-level (abjuration; arcane, negation, planar, protection)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** 10-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, S, M (pinch of powdered cold iron)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
An invisible sphere of antimagic forms around you, moving with you and suppressing all magical effects within it. At the Narrator’s discretion, sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the sphere’s effects.  
*Area Suppression:* When a magical effect protrudes into the sphere, that part of the effect’s area is suppressed.  
*Creatures and Objects:* While within the sphere, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic temporarily ceases to exist while the space they occupy is within the sphere.  
*Dispel Magic:* The sphere is immune to *dispel magic* and similar magical effects, including other *antimagic field* spells.  
*Magic Items:* While within the sphere, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the sphere.  
*Magical Travel:* Whether the sphere includes a destination or source, any planar travel or teleportation within it fails. Until the spell ends or the sphere moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a *bag of holding*) within the sphere are closed.  
*Spells:* Any spell cast within the sphere or at a target within the sphere is suppressed and the spell slot is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within the sphere. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent suppressed counts against it.

**Rare: Denying Antimagic Field.** This spell’s range increases to 30 feet, but your concentration on the spell ends when you move.  
**Rare: Steadfast Antimagic Field.** Creatures that are within the area when the spell is cast gain temporary hit points equal to your level. These temporary hit points last while they are within the spell’s area.

# Antipathy/Sympathy

*8th-level (enchantment; compulsion)*  
**Classes:** Druid, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** Huge or smaller object, creature,  
or 200-foot cube  
**Components:** V, S, M (flask of honey and vinegar)  
**Duration:** 10 days  
Designate a species or heritage of intelligent creature, such as dragons. The target now causes either antipathy or sympathy for the specified creatures for the duration of the spell. A creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect the first time it sees or comes within 60 feet of the target, every 24 hours thereafter, and whenever it ends its turn neither within 60 feet nor within sight of the target. When a designated creature successfully saves against the effects of the spell, it immediately understands it was under a magical effect and is immune to this spell’s effects for 1 minute.  
*Antipathy:* When a designated creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened on a failure. While frightened the creature must use its movement to move away from the target until it can no longer see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can no longer see it, it is no longer frightened until it can see the target or moves within 60 feet of it.  
*Sympathy:* When a designated creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature uses its movement on each of its turns to move into the area or within reach of the target, and is unwilling to move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect. 

**Rare: Fiendish Antipathy/Sympathy.** A fiend has disadvantage on its first saving throw against an effect caused by this spell.

# Arcane Eye

*4h-level (divination; arcane, scrying)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Components**: V, S, M (a mushroom-shaped piece  
of wood inside a universal joint)  
Duration: Concentration (1 hour)  
You create an invisible, floating magical eye through which you can see. The eye has normal vision, darkvision to a range of 30 feet, and it can look in every direction.  
You can use an action to move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction as long as it remains on the same plane of existence. The eye can pass through openings as small as 1 inch across but otherwise its movement is blocked by solid barriers.

**Rare: Sharpshooting Arcane Eye.** Until the spell ends, you have advantage on spell attacks you make against targets you can see with the eye.

# Arcane Hand

*5th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, protection)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Components:** V, S, M (gauntlet inlaid with  
copper tracery)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You create a Large, translucent hand made of force in an unoccupied space you can see.   
The hand doesn’t fill its space and has AC 20, Strength 26 (+8), Dexterity 10 (+0), maneuver DC 18, and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. The spell ends early if it is dropped to 0 hit points.  
When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then choose one of the following.  
*Shove:* The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the hand pushes the creature in a direction of your choosing for up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to 5 times your spellcasting ability modifier, and remains within 5 feet of it.  
*Smash:* Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within 5 feet of the hand. On a hit, the hand deals 4d8 force damage.  
*Snatch:* The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the creature is grappled by the hand. You can use a bonus action to crush a creature grappled by the hand, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 \+ your spellcasting ability modifier.  
*Stop:* Until the hand is given another command it moves to stay between you and a creature of your choice, granting you three-quarters cover against the chosen creature. A creature with a Strength score of 26 or less cannot move through the hand’s space, and stronger creatures treat the hand as difficult terrain.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage from Smash increases by 2d8 and the damage from Snatch increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

# Arcane Lock

*2nd-level (abjuration; arcane, protection)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** Closed entryway or container  
**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled or the target is broken  
The target is sealed to all creatures except those you designate (who can open the object normally). Alternatively, you may choose a password that suppresses this spell for 1 minute when it is spoken within 5 feet of the target. The spell can also be suppressed for 10 minutes by casting *knock* on the target. Otherwise, the target cannot be opened normally and it is more difficult to break or force open, increasing the DC to break it or pick any locks on it by 10 (minimum DC 20).  
**Cast at Higher Levels**. Increase the DC to force open the object or pick any locks on the object by an additional 2 for each slot level above 2nd. Only a *knock* spell cast at a slot level equal to or greater than your arcane lock suppresses it.

# Arcane Muscles

*Cantrip (transmutation; arcane, enhancement,*  
*transformation, unarmed)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, herald, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
Your muscles swell with arcane power. They’re too clumsy to effectively wield weapons but certainly strong enough for a powerful punch. Until the spell ends, you can choose to use your spellcasting ability score for Athletics checks, and for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.

# Arcane Riposte

*1st-level (evocation; arcane, attack)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature makes a melee attack against you  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You respond to an incoming attack with a magically-infused attack of your own. Make a melee spell attack against the creature that attacked you. If you hit, the creature takes 3d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell deals an extra 1d6 damage for each slot level above 1st. When using a 4th-level or higher spell slot, you may choose to deal psychic, radiant, or necrotic damage. When using a 6th-level or higher spell slot, you may choose to deal force damage.

**Rare: Unsettling Arcane Riposte.** When you deal 10 or more damage, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn.

**Arcane Sword**  
*7th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, force, summoning, weaponry)*  
**Classes:** Bard, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Components:** V, S, M (miniature sword worth 250 gold)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You summon an insubstantial yet deadly sword to do your bidding.  
Make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword, dealing 3d10 force damage on a hit.  
You can use a bonus action on subsequent turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a space you can see and make an identical melee spell attack against a target.

**Rare: Bloody Arcane Sword.** The spell’s damage is reduced to 3d6 and when a creature is damaged by the spell it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer a level of fatigue.

# Arcanist’s Magic Aura

*2nd-level (illusion; arcane, obscurement, scrying)*  
**Classes**: Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** Willing creature or an unattended object  
**Components:** V, S, M (small patch of silk)  
**Duration:** 24 hours (or until dispelled; see below)  
You craft an illusion to deceive others about the target’s true magical properties.  
Choose one or both of the following effects. When cast upon the same target with the same effect for 30 successive days, it lasts until it is dispelled.  
*False Aura:* A magical target appears nonmagical, a nonmagical target appears magical, or you change a target’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic of your choosing. Additionally, you can choose to make a nonmagical item seem magical to any creature that handles the item.  
*Masking Effect:* Choose a creature type. Spells and magical effects that detect creature types treat the target as if it were a creature of that type. Additionally, you can choose to mask the target’s alignment trait (if it has one).  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When cast using a 6th-level spell slot or higher the effects last until dispelled or dismissed with a bonus action.

# Aspect of the Moon

*3rd-level (transmutation; enhancement, nature, transformation, unarmed, weaponry)*  
**Classes:** Bard, druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You throw your head back and howl like a beast, embracing your most basic impulses. Until the spell ends your hair grows, your features become more feral, and sharp claws grow on your fingers. You gain a \+1 bonus to AC, your Speed increases by 10 feet, you have advantage on Perception checks, and your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 slashing damage. You may use your Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes, and treat your unarmed strikes as weapons with the finesse property. You gain an additional action on your turn, which may only be used to make a melee attack with your unarmed strike. If you are hit by a silvered weapon, you have disadvantage on your Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

# Astral Projection

*9th-level (necromancy; movement, planar, utility)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** Self and up to 8 willing creatures within reach while not on the Astral Plane  
**Components:** V, S, M (one jacinth worth 1,000 gold per creature affected and one ornately carved silver bar worth at least 100 gold per creature affected, all consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Varies  
Until the spell ends, the targets leave their material bodies (unconscious, not aging or requiring food or air) and project nearly identical forms into the Astral Plane. These astral forms use the targets’ game statistics and possessions.  
While in astral form the targets each trail a tether, a silvery-white cord that fades into immateriality a foot behind them. As long as the tether is not destroyed, a target can find their way back to their material body. If it is cut—which requires an effect specifically stating that it cuts your tether—the target immediately dies. Otherwise, damage and other effects on a target’s astral form have no effect on their material body either during this spell or after its duration ends. An astral form can travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through interplanar portals on the Astral Plane leading to any other plane. When a target leaves the Astral Plane, their material body and possessions are transported along the tether, allowing them to  freturnully intact to their body, with all their gear, as they enter the new plane.  
The spell ends for all targets when you use an action to dismiss it, for an individual target when a successful *dispel magic* is cast upon its astral form or material body, or when either its material body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points. When the spell ends for a target and the tether is intact, the tether pulls the target’s astral form back to its material body, ending the suspended animation.  
If the spell ends for you early, other targets are stranded in their astral forms until they drop to 0 hit points or leave the plane.

**Rare: Swift Astral Projection.** While in astral form your Speed is tripled and you can use a bonus action to Dash.

# Augury

*2nd-level (divination; communication, divine, scrying)*  
**Classes:** Cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (divinatory items worth at least 25 gold)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
With the aid of a divining tool, you receive an omen about the success or failure of a course of action that you plan to embark upon within the next 30 minutes. The Narrator chooses from the following:

* Fortunate omen (good results)  
* Calamity omen (bad results)  
* Ambivalence omen (both good and  
  bad results)  
* No omen (results that aren’t especially  
  good or bad)

This omen does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.  
When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases. The Narrator makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.

# Awaken

*5th-level (transmutation; beasts, enhancement, nature, plants)*  
**Classes:** Bard, druid

Intelligence 3 or less  
**Components:** V, S, M (an intricately carved agate worth at least 1,000 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You impart sentience in the target, granting it an Intelligence of 10 and proficiency in a language you know. A plant targeted by this spell gains the ability to move, as well as senses identical to those of a human. The Narrator assigns awakened plant statistics.  
The target is charmed by you for 30 days. The charmed condition ends early if you or your companions harm the target. Depending on how you treated the target while it was charmed, when the condition ends the awakened creature may choose to remain friendly to you.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** Target an additional creature for each slot level above 5th. Each target requires its own material component.

**Rare: Augmented Awaken.** When cast at higher levels, add 30 days to the charm effect of this spell for every 2 slot levels above 5th.  
**Rare: Slippery Awaken.** Oozes can be targeted by this spell.

**Components:** V, S, M (a small straw dolly)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Charisma negates  
The senses of the targets are filled with phantom energies that make them more vulnerable and less capable. Until the spell ends, a d4 is subtracted from attack rolls and saving throws made by a target.

**Rare: Unnerving Bane.** Targets affected by this spell are rattled.

**Duration:** Concentration (1d4+2 rounds; the Narrator rolls in secret)  
**Saving Throw:** Charisma negates  
The target is banished to a featureless demiplane (or its native plane, if it is not native to this plane) and incapacitated. At the end of this banishment, the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space).  
At the end of each of its turns, a banished creature can repeat the saving throw with a –1 penalty for each round it has spent banished, ending the banishment on a success. The banishment also ends if the spell ends early. If the spell is maintained for its maximum duration, a target native to this plane ends the banishment, while a target native to a different plane doesn’t return.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration of banishment on a native creature increases by 1 round for each slot level above 4th.

**Rare: Icy Displeasure.** Until the spell ends, the target is vulnerable to cold damage and it has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls.

# Barkskin

You fill your allies with a thirst for glory and battle using your triumphant rallying cry. Expend and roll a Bardic Inspiration die to determine the number of rounds you can maintain concentration on this spell (minimum 1 round). Each target gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to the number of rounds you have maintained concentration on this spell (maximum \+4).  
You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.

* Each turn, the target loses its action unless it succeeds a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn.  
* Your attacks and spells deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage against the target.

A curse lasts until the spell ends. At the Narrator’s discretion you may create a different curse effect with this spell so long as it is weaker than the options above.  
A *remove curse* spell ends the effect if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or greater than the spell slot used to cast *bestow curse*.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 4th-level spell slot the duration increases to 10 minutes. When using a 5th-level spell slot the duration increases to 8 hours and it no longer requires your concentration. When using a 7th-level spell slot the duration is 24 hours.

**Rare: Enduring Bestow Curse.** The spell’s duration is permanent, it no longer requires your concentration, and the curse cannot be dispelled.

A creature that starts its turn restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.  
A restrained creature can use its action to make an Acrobatics or Athletics check against the spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

When a creature starts its turn within the wall’s area or enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn, it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d10 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.

**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
Until the spell ends, roll 1d20 at the end of each of your turns. When you roll an 11 or higher you disappear and reappear in the Ethereal Plane (if you are already on the Ethereal Plane, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted). At the start of your next turn you return to an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of where you disappeared from. If no unoccupied space is available within range, you reappear in the nearest unoccupied space. As an action, you can dismiss this spell.

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One willing creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (drop of blood from both participants)

This spell creates a pact which is enforced by celestial or fiendish forces. You and another willing creature commit to a mutual agreement, clearly declaring your parts of the agreement during the casting.  
Until the spell ends, if for any reason either participant breaks the agreement or fails to uphold their part of the bargain, beings of celestial or fiendish origin appear within unoccupied spaces as close as possible to the participant who broke the bargain.

When the deal-breaking participant is killed, or the spell’s duration ends, the beings disappear in a flash of smoke.  
The spellcaster chooses whether the beings are celestial or fiendish while casting the spell, and the Narrator chooses the exact creatures summoned (such as a couatl or 5 imps). There may be any number of beings, but their combined Challenge Rating can’t exceed 5\.

By expending the retribution charge when you hit with a melee attack, you deal an additional 2d10 force damage.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You may use your reaction to halve the damage of an attack against you up to a number of times equal to the level of the spell slot used, gaining a retribution charge each time that lasts until 1 round after the spell ends.

On the round you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can choose one of the following effects. When you choose a different effect, the current one ends.  
*Flood:* The standing water level in the area rises by up to 20 feet. The flood water spills onto land if the area includes a shore, and otherwise you create a 20-foot-tall wave. The wave travels across the area in a direction of your choice and crashes down, carrying Huge or smaller vehicles to the other side and capsizing such vehicles on a roll of 1 on a 1d4. The wave repeats on the start of your next turn while this effect continues.  
*Part Water:* You create a 20-foot wide trench spanning the area with walls of water to either side. When this effect ends, the trench slowly refills over the course of the next round.  
*Redirect Flow:* Flowing water flows in your choice of direction, including up. Once the water moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its regular flow based on the terrain.  
*Whirlpool:* If the affected body of water is at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, a whirlpool forms within the area in a 50-foot wide cone that is 25 feet long. Creatures and objects that are in the area and within 25 feet of the whirlpool must succeed on an Athletics check against your spell save DC or be pulled 10 feet toward it. Once within the whirlpool, checks made to swim out of it have disadvantage. When a creature first enters the whirlpool on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and be pulled into the center of the whirlpool.

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 2nd-level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 3rd-level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (DC 10 \+ the spell’s level). On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect, but the creature can use its reaction to reshape the fraying magic and cast another spell with the same casting time as the original spell. This new spell must be cast at a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, or if both spells use the same level spell slot an opposed spellcasting ability check is made.

**Classes:** Cleric, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Components:** V, S, M (serving of fresh food or water)

Small humanoids  
**Components:** V, S, M (each corpse requires a clay pot filled with grave dirt, a clay pot filled with brackish water, and a black onyx stone worth 150 gold)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You reanimate the targets as undead and transform them into ghouls under your control. This spell cannot be cast in sunlight.   
While it is within 120 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead. When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.  
The undead is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any commands. You must cast this spell on the undead before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours. Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 3 undead you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You create or reassert control over one additional ghoul for each slot level above 6th. Alternatively, when using an 8th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 2 ghasts or wights, or when using a 9th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 3 ghasts or wights, or 2 mummies. When commanding more than 3 undead they make group attack rolls (see Combat).

**Duration:** Special  
You weave raw magic into a mundane physical object that fits in a 5-foot cube. The object must be of a shape and material you are familiar with. Using the object as a material component for another spell causes that spell to fail.  
The spell’s duration is determined by the material created. An object composed of multiple materials uses the shortest duration.  
*Cast at Higher Levels.* The size of the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

| TABLE: CREATION |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **MATERIAL** | **DURATION** |
| Vegetable matter | 1 day |

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You create up to four hovering lights, which can appear as torches or other illuminations, or one glowing Medium humanoid form. Each sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.  
You can use a bonus action to move the lights up to 60 feet so long as each remains within 20 feet of another. A dancing light is extinguished when it is no longer within the spell’s range.

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (torch coated with pitch)

**Rare: Darklight.** During the spell’s duration, you can use an action to kindle this light on a willing creature’s hand, sharing the effect with them. When the spell’s duration ends, or when any of the flames are dispelled, the spell ends.

# Darkness

**Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Area:** 15-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
Magical darkness blocks darkvision and nonmagical light in the area. The darkness spreads around corners, but completely covering or enclosing the source of the darkness with an opaque object blocks the darkness. If the area of darkness overlaps with magical light created by a 2nd- or lower level spell, the spell that created the light ends.  
When cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the darkness emanates from that object, moving with it. 

**Rare: Blinding Darkness.** A creature that moves out of the darkness must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded by this spell can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Area:** 60-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
Magical light fills the area. The area is brightly lit and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet. If any of the light overlaps with magical darkness created by a 3rd- or lower level spell, the spell that created the darkness ends.  
When cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the light shines from it, moving with it. Completely covering the object with something that is not transparent blocks the light.

# Deadweight

*2nd-level (transmutation; mobility, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Druid, herald, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** Medium or smaller object  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
The target object’s weight is greatly increased. Any creature holding the object must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop it. A creature that doesn’t drop the object has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn as it figures out the object’s new balance.  
Creatures that attempt to push, drag, or lift the object must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC to do so.

# Death Ward

**Classes:** Cleric, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
The first time damage would reduce the target to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 hit point. If an effect would kill the target instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect does not affect the target. The spell ends immediately after either of these conditions occur.

# Delayed Blast Fireball

*7th-level (evocation; arcane, fire)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 20-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, S, M (tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Dexterity halves  
A glowing bead of light flies from you and hovers at the center of the area until you end the spell—either because your concentration is broken or because you choose to end it—and then detonates. Each creature in the area takes 12d6 fire damage. The fire spreads around corners, and it damages and ignites any flammable unattended objects in the area.  
If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.  
If the bead is touched before the spell ends, the creature touching the bead makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the bead detonates. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet, moving the area with it, and the bead then detonates.  
***Cast at Higher Levels.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.

# Demiplane

*8th-level (conjuration; arcane, planar)*  
**Classes:** Warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** Solid flat surface  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
You create a shadowy door on the target, large enough for Medium creatures. The door leads to a demiplane that appears as an empty, 30-foot-cube chamber made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears from both sides, trapping any creatures or objects inside the demiplane.  
When you cast this spell, you can either create a new demiplane, recreate the door to a demiplane you have previously created, or make a door leading to another caster’s demiplane whose nature or contents you are familiar with.

# Detect Evil and Good

*1st-level (divination; divine, senses)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Special (30-foot radius)  
**Target:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You attempt to sense the presence of otherworldly forces. You automatically know if there is a place or object within range that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. In addition, on the round you cast it and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you may make a Wisdom (Religion) check against the passive Deception score of any aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creature within range. On a success, you sense the creature’s presence, as well as where the creature is located.  
The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

# Detect Magic

*1st-level (divination; arcane, divine, nature, senses)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric, druid, herald, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Special (30-foot radius)  
**Target:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You automatically sense whether or not there is any magic within range. You can use an action to see an aura around any visible creatures or objects that are magical or subject to a magical effect within range, as well as at least one school of magic (if any) related to such magical effects.  
The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 2nd-level spell slot or higher, the spell no longer requires your concentration. When using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 1 hour. When using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours.

# Detect Poison and Disease

*1st-level (divination; divine, nature, senses)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, druid, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Special (30-foot radius)  
**Target:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (yew leaf)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can attempt to sense the presence of poisons, poisonous creatures, and disease by making a Perception check. On a success you identify the type of each poison or disease within range. Typically noticing and identifying a poison or disease is a DC 10 check, but the Narrator may use DC 15 for uncommon afflictions, DC 20 for rare afflictions, or DC 25 for afflictions that are truly unique. On a failed check, this casting of the spell cannot sense that specific poison or disease.  
The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

# Detect Thoughts

*2nd-level (divination; arcane, senses, telepathy)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Special (30-foot radius)  
**Target:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (copper piece)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom (special)  
On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can probe the mind of a creature you can see within range. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or less or that don’t speak any languages are unaffected. On a failed save, you learn the creature’s surface thoughts—what is most on its mind in that moment. On a successful save, you fail to read the creature’s thoughts and can’t attempt to probe its mind for the duration. Conversation naturally shapes the course of a creature’s thoughts and what it is thinking about may change based on questions verbally directed at it.  
Once you have read a creature’s surface thoughts, you can use an action to probe deeper into its mind. The creature makes a second Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, you fail to read the creature’s deeper thoughts and the spell ends. On a failure, you gain insight into the creature’s motivations, emotional state, worries, and obsessions. The creature then becomes aware you are probing its mind and can use an action to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check, ending the spell if it succeeds.  
Additionally, you can use an action to scan for creatures within range that you can’t see but that have an Intelligence of 4 or higher. Once you detect the presence of a creature, so long as it remains within range you can attempt to read its thoughts as described above (even if you can’t see it).  
The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 5th-level spell slot, increase the spell’s range to 1 mile. When using a 7th-level spell slot, increase the range to 10 miles. When using a 9th-level spell slot, increase the range to 1,000 miles.

**Rare: Specific Detect Thoughts.** You can scan the thoughts of all creatures within range and locate one creature currently thinking about a single subject you choose when you cast the spell. You can read its thoughts as described in the spell’s description. This spell does not reveal the creature having these thoughts.

# Dimension Door

*4th-level (conjuration; arcane, teleportation)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Special (500 feet)  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You teleport to any place you can see, visualize, or describe by stating distance and direction.  
You can bring along objects that don’t exceed your carrying capacity. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller within 5 feet of you, provided it isn’t carrying gear beyond its carrying capacity.  
If you would arrive in an occupied space the spell fails, and you and any creature with you each take 4d6 force damage.

# Disguise Self

*1st-level (illusion; arcane, obscurement)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
Until the spell ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you and your gear are cloaked by an illusory disguise that makes you appear like another creature of your general size and body type, making changes including but not limited to: your heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex, and any other distinguishing features. You cannot disguise yourself as a creature of a different size category, and your limb structure remains the same.   
Illusory changes in shape can be discovered by touch. To see through your disguise without touching it, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, this spell functions identically to the *seeming* spell, except the spell’s duration is 10 minutes.

# Disintegrate

*6th-level (transmutation; arcane, attack, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One creature, object, or creation of magical force  
**Components:** V, S, M (lodestone and pinch of dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Saving Throw:** Dexterity negates  
You shoot a glowing ray at the target. It takes 10d6 \+ 40 force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points is obliterated, leaving behind nothing but dust, along with anything it was wearing or carrying (except magic items). Only *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell can restore it to life.  
This spell automatically disintegrates nonmagical objects and creations of magical force that are Large-sized or smaller. Larger objects and creations of magical force have a 10-foot-cube portion disintegrated instead. Magic items are unaffected.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

# Dispel Evil and Good

*5th-level (abjuration; divine, protection)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth 25 gold)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
Until the spell ends, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.  
You can end the spell early by using an action to do either of the following.  
*Mental Resistance:* Choose up to 3 friendly creatures within 60 feet. Each of those creatures that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead may make an immediate saving throw with advantage against the condition or possession, ending it on a success.  
*Retribution:* Make a melee spell attack against a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within reach. On a hit, the creature takes 7d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) and is stunned until the beginning of your next turn.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** Mental Resistance targets one additional creature for each slot level above 5th, and Retribution’s damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

**Rare: Dismissal.** The spell also affects aberrations and dragons.

# Dispel Magic

*3rd-level (abjuration; arcane, negation, protection, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric, druid, herald, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Target:** One creature, object, or magical effect  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** instantaneous  
You scour the magic from your target. Any spell cast on the target ends if it was cast with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower. For spells using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, make a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 \+ the spell’s level for each one, ending the effect on a success.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the level of the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot used to cast dispel magic.

**Rare: Confiscating Dispel Magic.** When you dispel a spell that was cast using a spell slot at least 2 levels lower than the one used for this spell, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot of equal level to the dispelled spell and immediately cast it at a new target.

# Divination

*4th-level (divination; communication, divine, knowledge)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, warlock  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and sacrificial offering worth at least 25 gold appropriate to the higher power, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You ask your higher powers a single question about something that will (or could) happen in the next 7 days. The Narrator offers a truthful reply, which may be cryptic or even nonverbal as appropriate to the being in question. The reply does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.  
When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases. The Narrator makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.

# Divine Favor

*1st-level (evocation; attack, divine, radiant, weaponry)*  
**Classes:** Herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage with your weapon attacks.

**Rare: Spiteful Divine Favor.** You deal extra necrotic damage instead of extra radiant damage, and when rolling extra damage from this spell you reroll any results of 1\.

# Divine Word

*7th-level (evocation; affliction, divine)*  
**Classes:** Cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Any number of creatures within range that can hear you  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You utter a primordial imprecation that brings woe upon your enemies. A target suffers an effect based on its current hit points.

* Fewer than 50 hit points: deafened for 1 minute.  
* Fewer than 40 hit points: blinded and deafened for 10 minutes.  
* Fewer than 30 hit points: stunned, blinded, and deafened for 1 hour.  
* Fewer than 20 hit points: killed.

Additionally, when a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend is affected by this spell it is immediately forced back to its home plane and for 24 hours it is unable to return to your current plane by any means less powerful than a *wish* spell. Such a creature does not suffer this effect if it is already on its plane of origin.

**Rare: Imprecating Divine Word.** The spell’s additional effect also targets aberrations and dragons, sending them to a harmless demiplane.

# Dominate Beast

*4th-level (enchantment; beasts, compulsion, nature)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One beast  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
You assert control over the target’s mind and it is charmed for the duration. If it is engaged in combat with you or creatures friendly to you, it has advantage on its saving throw.  
Until the charmed condition ends, you establish a telepathic link with it while you are on the same plane. You may issue commands through this link and the target does its best to obey. No action is required to issue commands, which can be a simple and general course of action such as “Attack that target,” “Go over there,” or “Bring me that object.” Without commands the target only defends itself. The target continues to follow a command until its task is complete.  
You can use your action to assume direct control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, you decide all of the target’s actions and movements. While a target is directly controlled in this way, you can also cause it to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.  
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new saving throw against the spell, ending the spell on a success.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell’s duration is extended: 5th-level—Concentration (10 minutes), 6th-level—Concentration (1 hour), 7th-level—Concentration (8 hours).

# Dominate Monster

*1st-level (enchantment; fear, psychic, sound)*  
**Classes:** Bard  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (broken violin string and a wasp’s stinger)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
You frighten the target by echoing its movements with ominous music and terrifying sound effects. It takes 1d4 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you until the spell ends.  
At the end of each of the creature’s turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 psychic damage.  
You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

**Rare: Subtle Dramatic Sting.** When you cast this spell, make a Performance check opposed by the target’s Perception check. On a success, the target is affected by the spell but does not realize it is being targeted by a spell. Each round at the start of its turn, the target gains an expertise die on a Perception check made against the result of your Performance check to realize it has been targeted by a spell.

# Dream

*5th-level (illusion; affliction, communication)*  
**Classes:** Bard, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Special  
**Target:** One creature that is known to you and on the same plane  
**Components:** V, S, M (sand, ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
Until the spell ends, you manipulate the dreams of another creature. You designate a messenger, which may be you or a willing creature you touch, to enter a trance. The messenger remains aware of its surroundings while in the trance but cannot take actions or move. During the duration of the spell, the messenger knows when the target is asleep. The messenger can end the trance at any time, ending the spell.   
While the target is asleep the messenger can appear in its dreams and can speak and act in the dream. The messenger can also manipulate the dream, creating objects, landscapes, and various other sensory sensations. The target remembers the dream in perfect detail when it wakes.   
You can choose to let the messenger terrorize the target. The messenger can deliver a message of 10 words or fewer and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you have a portion of the target’s body (some hair or a drop of blood) it has disadvantage on its saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the messenger’s fearful aspect create a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents it from benefiting from the rest. In addition, upon waking the target suffers a level of fatigue or strife (your choice), up to a maximum of 3 in either condition.  
Creatures that don’t sleep or don’t dream (such as elves) cannot be targeted by this spell.

**Rare: Terrible Dream.** When you choose to terrorize a target, if it fails its saving throw it suffers both a level of fatigue and strife. You may also convey a message of up to 25 words as part of terrorizing it (rather than 10 words).

# Druidcraft

*Cantrip (transmutation; nature, utility)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You produce one of the following effects within range:

* You create a minor, harmless sensory effect that lasts for 1 round and predicts the next 24 hours of weather in your current location.  
* You instantly make a plant feature mature, but never to produce Supply. For example, you can cause a flower to bloom or a seed pod to open.  
* You create an instantaneous, harmless illusory effect such as the sound of running water, birdsong, or the smell of mulch. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.  
* You ignite or extinguish a small fire.

# Earth Barrier

*1st-level (abjuration; earth, protection)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are targeted with a ranged attack  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
Choose an unoccupied space between you and the source of the attack which triggers the spell. You call forth a pillar of earth or stone (3 feet diameter, 20 feet tall, AC 10, 20 hit points) in that space that provides you with three-quarters cover (+5 to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide).

**Rare: Crystal Pillar.** The pillar summoned by this spell is made of translucent crystal. If this spell causes an attack to miss, the attack hits the pillar instead. If this pillar is destroyed, every creature within 5 feet of it takes 2d6 piercing damage.

# Earthquake

*8th-level (evocation; earth, terrain)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Special (500 feet)  
**Area:** 100-foot radius circle centered on a point on the ground  
**Components:** V, S, M (dirt, rock, and clay)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
Until the spell ends, tremors shake the area and anything in contact with it.  
The ground in the spell’s area becomes difficult terrain as it warps and cracks. Additionally, any creature that is concentrating on a spell while in contact with the ground in the spell’s area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.  
When you cast this spell and at the end of each of your turns, each creature in contact with the ground in the spell’s area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.  
At the Narrator’s discretion, this spell may have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area.  
*Fissures:* At the start of your next turn after you cast the spell, roll 1d6. This number of 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide fissures bisect the area at your choice of locations. A creature standing on a fissure makes a Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failure and moving to the edge of the fissure on a success.  
A structure automatically collapses if a fissure opens beneath it (see below).  
*Structures:* A structure in contact with the ground in the spell’s area takes 50 bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is active. A structure reduced to 0 hit points this way collapses.  
Creatures within half the distance of a collapsing structure’s height must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 bludgeoning damage, be knocked prone, and be buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check as an action to escape. A creature inside (instead of near) a collapsing structure has disadvantage on its saving throw. The Narrator can adjust the DC higher or lower depending on the composition of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.

**Rare: Tempestuous Earthquake.** The spell fills the area with violent winds. A flying creature halves its speed while in the area and makes a Dexterity saving throw at the start of each of its turns or falls prone.

# Eldritch Cube

*5th-level (conjuration; law, psychic)*  
**Classes:** Warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Special  
A black, nonreflective, incorporeal 10-foot cube appears in an unoccupied space that you can see. Its space can be in midair if you so desire. When a creature starts its turn in the cube or enters the cube for the first time on its turn it must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 5d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.  
As a bonus action, you can move the cube up to 10 feet in any direction to a space you can see. The cube cannot be made to pass through other creatures in this way.

**Rare: Stunning Eldritch Cube.** A creature that takes 20 or more damage from this spell is stunned until the end of its next turn.

# Enhance Ability

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, druid, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature

*Bull’s Strength:* The target has advantage on Strength checks and doubles its carrying capacity.  
*Cat’s Grace:* The target has advantage on Dexterity checks and it reduces any falling damage it takes by 10 unless it is incapacitated.  
*Eagle’s Splendor:* The target has advantage on Charisma checks and is instantly cleaned (as if it had just bathed and put on fresh clothing).  
*Fox’s Cunning:* The target has advantage on Intelligence checks and on checks using gaming sets.  
*Owl’s Wisdom:* The target has advantage on Wisdom checks and it gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet (or extends its existing darkvision by 30 feet).  
**Cast at Higher Levels***.* You target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

**Rare: Guarded Enhance Ability.** When the target makes a saving throw using the chosen ability score, it can use its reaction to end the spell and gain advantage.

# Enlarge/Reduce

*2nd-level (transmutation; affliction, arcane,*  
*enhancement, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** One creature or object that is not being worn or carried  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered iron)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Constitution negates  
You cause the target to grow or shrink. An unwilling target may attempt a saving throw to resist the spell.  
If the target is a creature, all items worn or carried by it also change size with it, but an item dropped by the target immediately returns to normal size.  
*Enlarge:* Until the spell ends, the target’s size increases by one size category. Its size doubles in all dimensions and its weight increases eightfold. The target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Its weapons also enlarge, dealing an extra 1d4 damage.  
*Reduce:* Until the spell ends, the target’s size decreases one size category. Its size is halved in all dimensions and its weight decreases to one-eighth of its normal value. The target has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws and its weapons shrink, dealing 1d4 less damage (its attacks deal a minimum of 1 damage).  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a spell slot of 4th-level, you can cause the target and its gear to increase by two size categories—from Medium to Huge, for example. Until the spell ends, the target’s size is quadrupled in all dimensions, multiplying its weight twentyfold. The target has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Its weapons also enlarge, dealing an extra 2d4 damage.

# Enrage Architecture

**Components:** V, S, M (stone or timber removed from a structure at least 100 years old)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You animate and enrage a target building that lashes out at its inhabitants and surroundings. As a bonus action you may command the target to open, close, lock, or unlock any nonmagical doors or windows, or to thrash about and attempt to crush its inhabitants. While the target is thrashing, any creature inside or within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. When the spell ends, the target returns to its previous state, magically repairing any damage it sustained during the spell’s duration.

# Entangle

**Area:** 20-foot square centered a point on the ground  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
Constraining plants erupt from the ground in the spell’s area, wrapping vines and tendrils around creatures. Until the spell ends, the area is difficult terrain.  
When you cast the spell, each creature in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained as the plants wrap around it. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.  
When the spell ends, the plants wither and disappear.

# Enthrall

**Target:** Any number of creatures you choose within range  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
You weave a compelling stream of words that captivates your targets. Any target that can’t be charmed automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and targets fighting you or creatures friendly to you have advantage on the saving throw.  
Until the spell ends or a target can no longer hear you, it has disadvantage on Perception checks made to perceive any creature other than you. The spell ends if you are unable to speak.

# Etherealness

*7th-level (transmutation; movement, obscurement, planar)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
Until the spell ends or you use an action to end it, you enter the region of the Ethereal Plane that borders your current plane.  While on the Ethereal Plane, you can move in any direction, but vertical movement is considered difficult terrain. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything looks desaturated and you can see no further than 60 feet.  
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other objects and creatures on that plane, so you can pass through obstacles on your plane of origin. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you without special magical abilities.  
When the spell ends, you return to your plane of origin in the spot you currently occupy. If you share the space of a solid object or creature, you move to the nearest unoccupied space and take 10 force damage for each 5 feet you are moved.  
The spell fails if you cast it while you are already on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You can target up to 3 willing creatures within 10 feet (including you) for each slot level above 7th.

Your familiar, a spirit that takes the form of any CR 0 beast of Small or Tiny size, appears in an unoccupied space within range. It has the statistics of the chosen form, but is your choice of a celestial, fey, or fiend (instead of a beast).  
Your familiar is an independent creature that rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn in combat (but cannot take the Attack action). However, it is loyal to you and always obeys your commands.  
When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes without a trace. Casting the spell again causes it to reappear.  
You are able to communicate telepathically with your familiar when it is within 100 feet. As long as it is within this range, you can use an action to see through your familiar’s eyes and hear through its ears until the beginning of your next turn, gaining the benefit of any of its special senses. During this time, you are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings.  
You can use an action to either permanently dismiss your familiar or temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. While it is temporarily dismissed, you can use an action to call it back, causing it to appear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  
You can’t have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can cause it to adopt a different form.  
When you cast a spell with a range of Touch and your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can deliver the spell as if it was the spellcaster. Your familiar must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, use your attack bonus for the spell.

* Its type is your choice of celestial, fey, or fiend.  
* Its size is your choice of Medium or Large.  
* Its Intelligence is 6\.  
* You can communicate with it telepathically while it’s within 1 mile.  
* It understands one language that you speak.

While mounted on your steed, when you cast a spell that targets only yourself, you may also target the steed.  
When you use an action to dismiss the steed, or when it drops to 0 hit points, it temporarily disappears. Casting this spell again resummons the steed, fully healed and with all conditions removed. You can’t summon a different steed unless you spend an action to release your current steed from its bond, permanently dismissing it.

The cage also traps creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and can only be destroyed by being dealt at least 25 force damage at once or by a *dispel magic* spell cast using an 8th-level or higher spell slot.

Instead of firing the globe, you can hold it in your hand. If you handle it carefully, it won’t explode until a minute after you cast the spell. At any time, you or another creature can strike the globe, throw it up to 60 feet, or use it as a slingstone, causing it to explode on impact.

**Components:** V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth 200 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered  
You trace a glyph on the target. If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends. Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Investigation check against your spell save DC.  
Describe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the glyph, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph. The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it. You can specify certain creatures which don’t trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.  
When you cast the spell, choose Explosive Runes or Spell Glyph.  
*Explosive Runes:* When triggered, the glyph explodes. Creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice when you cast the spell), or half damage on a successful save. The explosion spreads around corners.  
*Spell Glyph:* You store a spell of 3rd-level or lower as part of creating the glyph, expending its spell slot. The stored spell must target a single creature or area with a non-beneficial effect and it is cast when the glyph is triggered. A spell that targets a creature targets the triggering creature. A spell with an area is centered on the targeting creature. A creation or conjuration spell affects an area next to that creature, and targets it with any harmful effects. Spells requiring concentration last for their full duration.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The cost of the material component increases by 200 gold for each slot level above 3rd. For Explosive Runes, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd, and for Spell Glyph you can store a spell of up to the same level as the spell slot used to cast glyph of warding.

A *dispel magic* only dispels an *imprisonment* if it is cast using a 9th-level spell slot and targets the prison or the special component used to create the prison.

In addition, on a hit with the *infernal weapon*, you can end the spell early to inflict an automatic critical hit.

Name or describe in detail an object familiar to you. The spell reveals the general direction the object is in (south, east, northwest, and so on) if it exists within range. This includes its current trajectory if it’s travelling.  
You may locate a specific object known to you, provided that you have observed it within 30 feet at least once. You may also find the closest example of a certain type of object (for example an instrument, item of furniture, compass, or vase).  
When there is any thickness of lead in the direct path between you and the object the spell is unable to find it.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The target gains 5 temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st. The temporary hit points last for the spell’s duration.

**Rare: Enhanced Mage Armor.** The target’s AC becomes 10 \+ your proficiency bonus \+ its Dexterity modifier.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
A faintly shimmering phantasmal hand appears at a point you choose within range. It remains until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 30 feet from it.  
You can use an action to control the hand and direct it to do any of the following:

* manipulate an object.  
* open an unlocked container or door.  
* stow or retrieve items from unlocked containers.

The hand cannot attack, use magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

# Magic Circle

*3rd-level (abjuration; compulsion, protection)*  
**Classes:** Herald, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Celestials, elementals, fey, fiends or undead (designate one)  
**Area:** 10-foot radius cylinder that is 20 feet high  
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or ornately engraved padlocks worth 100 gold, consumed  
by the spell)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
Magical energies surround the area and stop the designated type of creature from willingly entering by nonmagical means.  
Creatures of the designated type have disadvantage when attacking creatures within the area and are unable to charm, frighten, or possess creatures within the area. When a designated creature attempts to teleport or use interplanar travel to enter the area, it makes a Charisma saving throw or its attempt fails.  
You may also choose to invert this spell, trapping a creature of your chosen type within the area and prevent it from acting outside of said area   
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell’s duration increases by 1 hour for every slot level above 3rd.

# Magic Jar

*6th-level (necromancy; arcane, compulsion, evil)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Target:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (box, locket, gem, or other highly decorated vessel worth at least 500 gold)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled  
Your body becomes unconscious and incapable of being roused, while your soul enters the vessel used as a material component.   
Souls within the jar are aware of their surroundings as though they occupied that space.   
While your soul is within the jar, you can, as an action, project your soul to a target within range, either returning it to your body or attempting to possess a humanoid creature. You can take no other actions. You may not target creatures protected by *protection from good and evil* or *magic circle* spells. A creature you try to possess makes a Charisma saving throw or your soul moves from your vessel and into its body. The creature’s soul is now ensnared within the container. On a successful save, the creature resists and you may not attempt to possess it for 24 hours.  
Upon possessing a creature, you gain control of it. Replace your game statistics with the creature’s, except your Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom scores. Your own cultural traits and class features also remain, and you may not use the creature’s cultural traits or class features (if it has any).  
During possession, you may use an action to return to the vessel if it is within range, returning the host creature to its body. If the host body dies while you are possessing it, the creature also dies and you must make a Charisma save against the spellcasting DC of the spell when it was cast. On a success you return to the container if it’s within range. Otherwise, you die.  
If the vessel is destroyed, the spell ends and your soul returns to your body if it’s within range. If your body is out of range or dead when you try to return, you die.  
 Souls in the jar other than those of the caster cannot take actions or movement. If the vessel is destroyed while occupied by a creature other than yourself, the creature returns to its body if the body is alive and within range. Otherwise, the creature dies.  
The vessel is destroyed when the spell ends.

**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** One unattended object  
**Components:** V, S, M (slice of dried ox tongue or a feather from a lyrebird)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled  
The target is imbued with a spoken message of 25 words or fewer which it speaks when a trigger condition you choose is met. The message may take up to 10 minutes to convey.  
When your trigger condition is met, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in the same voice and volume as you used when instructing it. If the object chosen has a mouth (for example, a painted portrait) this is where the mouth appears.  
You may choose upon casting whether the message is a single event, or whether it repeats every time the trigger condition is met.  
The trigger condition must be based upon audio or visual cues within 30 feet of the object, and may be highly detailed or as broad as you choose. For example, the trigger could be when any attack action is made within range, or when the first spring shoot breaks ground within range.

**Rare: Mocking Magic Mouth***.* As long as you also know the *vicious mockery* cantrip, when you cast this spell with a trigger that is a single event you can choose to cast *vicious mockery* through the magical mouth.

# Magic Weapon

*transformation, weaponry)*  
**Classes:** Herald, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Duration**: 24 hours  
You conjure an extradimensional residence within range. It has one glittering entrance that is in a space of your choosing, and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any designated creatures may enter your mansion while the portal is open. You may open and close the portal while you are within 30 feet of it. Once closed the entrance is invisible. The mansion:

* Has an opulent entrance hall.  
* Has a floorplan you chose, made up of fifty or fewer contiguous 10-foot cubes. All furniture and decor are chosen by you  
* Contains enough Supply for 5 x your proficiency bonus creatures

A staff of translucent, lustrous servants dwell within, obeying your comments without question and capable of performing the same nonhostile actions as a human servant, though they cannot leave the mansion.  
All objects and furnishings belonging to the mansion evaporate into shimmering smoke when they leave it. Any creature within the mansion when the spell ends is expelled into an unoccupied space near the entrance.

# Major Image

*3rd-level (illusion; arcane, chaos)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 20-foot cube  
**Components:** V, S, M (tinderbox and small mirror)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You create an image in the area that appears completely real. The illusion includes sounds, smells, and temperature in addition to visual phenomena. None of the sensory effects of the illusion are able to cause harm.  
While within range you can use an action to move the illusion elsewhere within range. As the image moves you may also change its appearance to make the movement seem natural (like a roc moving its wings to fly) and also change the nonvisual elements of the illusion for the same reason (like the sound of beating wings as the roc flies).  
Any physical interaction allows a creature to recognize the image is an illusion. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion. When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When cast using a 6th-level spell slot the illusion lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration.

# Mass Cure Wounds

*5th-level (evocation; divine, healing)*

# Mass Suggestion

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** Up to twelve creatures that can hear and understand you  
**Components:** V, M (miniature bottle of wine and some soap)  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. Suggest an activity phrased in a sentence or two. The targets are magically influenced to follow that course of activity. The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable. Asking the targets to perform an action that is obviously harmful to them ends the spell.  
A target carries out the activity suggested by you as well as it can for the duration of the spell or until the target has carried out the activity.  
You may specify trigger conditions that cause a target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.   
Any damage done to a target by you or an ally ends the spell for that creature.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When cast using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration of the spell increases to 10 days. When cast using an 8th-level spell slot, the duration increases to 30 days. When cast using a 9th-level spell slot, the duration increases to a year and a day.

# Maze

*8th-level (conjuration; arcane, chaos, compulsion, planar)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
The target is banished to a complex maze on its own demiplane, and remains there for the duration or until the target succeeds in escaping.  
The target can use an action to make an Intelligence saving throw to solve the maze. On a successful save it escapes and the spell ends. A creature with Labyrinthine Recall (or a similar trait) automatically succeeds on its save.  
When the spell ends the target reappears in the space it occupied before the spell was cast, or the closest unoccupied space.

# Meld Into Stone

*3rd-level (transmutation; nature, obscurement, shapechanging, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** A stone object or surface large enough to contain your body  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
Until the spell ends, you meld yourself and your carried equipment into the target stone. Using your movement, you may enter the stone from any point you can touch. No trace of your presence is visible or detectable by nonmagical senses.  
Within the stone, you can’t see outside it and have disadvantage on Perception checks made to hear beyond it. You are aware of time passing, and may cast spells upon yourself. You may use your movement only to step out of the target where you entered it, ending the spell.  
If the target is damaged such that its shape changes and you no longer fit within it, you are expelled and take 6d6 bludgeoning damage. Complete destruction of the target, or its transmutation into another substance, expels you and you take 50 bludgeoning damage. When expelled you fall prone into the closest unoccupied space near your entrance point.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 5th-level spell slot, you may reach out of the target to make spell attacks or ranged weapon attacks without ending the spell. You make these attacks with disadvantage.

**Rare: Mobile Meld Into Stone.** Until the spell ends, you gain a burrow speed of 10 feet.

# Mending

*Cantrip (transmutation; arcane, transformation, utility)*

**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You repair a single rip or break in the target object (for example, a cracked goblet, torn page, or ripped robe). The break must be smaller than 1 foot in all dimensions. The spell leaves no trace that the object was damaged.  
Magic items and constructs may be repaired in this way, but their magic is not restored. You gain an expertise die on maintenance checks if you are able to cast this spell on the item you are treating.

# Mental Grip

*2nd-level (conjuration; affliction)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, herald, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Components:** V, S, M (rusted manacle)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You conjure extensions of your own mental fortitude to keep your foes at bay. For the spell’s duration, you can use an action to attempt to grapple a creature within range by making a concentration check against its maneuver DC.  
On its turn, a target grappled in this way can use an action to attempt to escape the grapple, using your spell save DC instead of your maneuver DC. Successful escape attempts do not break your concentration on the spell.

# Message

*Cantrip (transmutation; arcane, communication)*  
**Classes:** Bard, herald, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (scrap of paper)  
**Duration:** 1 round  
You point and whisper your message at the target. It alone hears the message and may reply in a whisper audible only to you.  
You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and are certain it is beyond the barrier. The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.  
The spell moves freely around corners or through openings.

# Meteor Swarm

*9th-level (evocation; affliction, arcane, attack,*  
*fire, storm)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Special (1 mile)  
**Area:** Four 40-foot radius spheres  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Saving Throw:** Dexterity halves  
Scorching spheres of flame strike the ground at 4 different points within range. The effects of a sphere reach around corners. Creatures and objects in the area take 14d6 fire damage and 14d6 bludgeoning damage, and flammable unattended objects catch on fire. If a creature is in the area of more than one sphere, it is affected only once.

**Rare: Decisive Meteor Swarm.** A creature that takes 50 or more damage is knocked prone. A creature that takes 100 or more damage is stunned until the end of its next turn and knocked prone.

**Classes:** Bard, wizard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One willing creature  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
The target is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would read its emotions or thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition.  
This immunity extends even to the *wish* spell, and magical effects or spells of similar power that would affect the target’s mind or gain information about it.

# Mindshield

*4th-level (abjuration; protection, psychic)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature

# Minor Illusion

*Cantrip (illusion; arcane, chaos)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Area:** 5-foot cube  
**Components:** S, M (tinderbox and small mirror)  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
This spell creates a sound or image of an object. The illusion disappears if dismissed or you cast the spell again.  
You may create any sound you choose, ranging in volume from a whisper to a scream. You may choose one sound for the duration or change them at varying points before the spell ends. Sounds are audible outside the spell’s area.  
Visual illusions may replicate any image and remain within the spell’s area, but cannot create sound, light, smell, or other sensory effects.  
The image is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction as physical objects and creatures pass through it. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion. When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature.

# Mirage Arcane

*7th-level (illusion; arcane, chaos, nature, obscurement, terrain, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Druid, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Special (sight)  
**Area:** Special  
(1-mile square)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 days  
You make terrain within the spell’s area appear as another kind of terrain, tricking all senses (including touch). The general shape of the terrain remains the same, however.   
Structures may be altered, or added where there are none. Creatures are not disguised, concealed, or added by the spell.  
The illusion can be physically interacted with. Clear terrain can become difficult terrain, and vice versa. Any part of the illusory terrain such as a boulder, or water collected from an illusory stream, disappears immediately upon leaving the spell’s area.  
Creatures with truesight see through the illusion, but are not immune to its effects. They may know that the overgrown path is in fact a well maintained road, but are still impeded by illusory rocks and branches.

# Mirror Image

*2nd-level (illusion; arcane, chaos, obscurement)*  
**Classes:** Warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear, sharing your space. These copies move with you and mimic your behavior, creating confusion as to which is real. You can use an action to dismiss them.  
Each time you’re targeted by a creature’s attack, roll a d20 to see if it targets you or a copy.  
With 3 copies, a roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted. With two copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets the copy.  
A copy’s AC is 10 \+ your Dexterity modifier, and when it is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed. It may be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. All other damage and effects have no impact.  
Attacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have blindsight, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration increases to concentration (1 hour).

**Rare: Blinding Mirror Image.** When one of your illusory copies is destroyed, it explodes in a brilliant flash of light. A creature that destroys an illusory copy makes a Constitution saving throw or is blinded until the start of its next turn.

# Mislead

*5th-level (illusion; arcane, chaos, obscurement,*  
*transformation)*  
**Classes:** Bard, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
You become invisible. Simultaneously, an illusory copy of you appears where you’re standing. This invisibility ends when you cast a spell but the copy lasts until the spell ends.  
You can use an action to move your copy up to twice your Speed, have it speak, make gestures, or behave however you’d like.  
You may see and hear through your copy. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to swap from seeing through your copy’s senses or your own, and vice versa. While using your copy’s senses you are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings.  
The copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects and creatures pass through it.

# Misty Step

*2nd-level (conjuration; arcane, chaos, movement, teleportation)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Self  
**Components:** V

You teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see, disappearing and reappearing in a swirl of shimmering mist.

**Rare: Elusive Misty Step.** Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you are made with disadvantage.

# Modify Memory

*5th-level (enchantment; communication,*  
*compulsion, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
The target has advantage on its saving throw if you are in combat with it. The target becomes charmed and incapacitated, though it can still hear you. Until the spell ends, any memories of an event that took place within the last 24 hours and lasted 10 minutes or less may be altered.  
Altering memories must adhere to the following parameters:

* You may destroy the memory, have the target recall the event with perfect clarity, change specific details, or create a new memory that matches the timeframe and length. The target fills in gaps in details.  
* you must speak to the target in a language you both know to modify its memories and describe how the memory is changed  
* The memory must be logical and plausible to the creature or they are able to simply dismiss it as an obviously faulty memory  
* Modified memories will not necessarily change a creature’s behavior, especially if conflicts with the creature’s personality, beliefs, etc

The spell automatically ends if  the target takes any damage or if it is targeted by another spell. If the spell ends before you have finished modifying its memories, the alteration fails. Otherwise, the alteration is complete when the spell ends and only *greater restoration* or *remove curse* can restore the memory.  
There may be events that are unforgettable and utterly fundamental to a creature’s existence. After such memories are modified, they can be remembered correctly when another creature succeeds on a Persuasion check to stir the target’s memories. This check is made with disadvantage if the creature does not have indisputable proof on hand that is relevant to the altered memory.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 6th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 7 days ago. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 30 days ago. When using an 8th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 1 year ago. When using a 9th-level spell slot, any event can be altered.

# Moonbeam

*2nd-level (evocation; nature, radiant)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 5-foot radius cylinder that is 40 feet high  
**Components:** V, S, M (moonseed seeds and a piece of feldspar)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Constitution (special)  
A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.  
Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while within the spell’s light.  
On your turn, you may use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Rare: Cursed Moonbeam.** An ominous moon of darkness appears above the target location. The cursed moon emanates no light and deals necrotic damage as grasping shadows tear into creatures in the spell’s area. On a failed saving throw, a creature’s speed is halved until the start of its next turn.  
Celestial creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw in addition to shapechangers.

# Move Earth

*6th-level (transmutation; earth, nature, terrain, utility)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** Square of clay, dirt, or sand up to 40 feet on a side  
**Components:** V, S, M (iron blade and a bag of mixed soils)  
**Duration:** Concentration (2 hours)  
You reshape the area, changing its elevation or creating and eliminating holes, walls, and pillars. The only limitation is that the elevation change may not exceed half the area’s horizontal dimensions. For example, affecting a 40-by-40 area allows you to include 20 foot high pillars, holes 20 feet deep, and changes in terrain elevation of 20 feet or less. Changes that result in unstable terrain are subject to collapse.  
Changes take 10 minutes to complete, after which you can choose another area to affect. Due to the slow speed of transformation, it is nearly impossible for creatures to be hurt or captured by the spell.  
This spell has no effect on stone, objects crafted from stone, or plants, though these objects will shift based on changes in the area.

**Rare: Holey Move Earth.** The spell’s duration is instantaneous and it no longer requires your concentration. You affect up to 4 areas but only make caverns or holes (determined at the time of casting), each of which must be 20-foot cubes or smaller.

# Nondetection

*3rd-level (abjuration; arcane, negation, obscurement, scrying, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, wizard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** Creature, place or object  
**Components:** V, S, M (25 gold worth of diamond dust, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
The target is hidden from divination magic and cannot be perceived by magical scrying sensors. When used on a place or object, the spell only works if the target is no larger than 10 feet in any given dimension.

# Passwall

*5th-level (transmutation; arcane, terrain, utility)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Plaster, stone, or wooden surface  
**Components:** V, S, M (sesame seeds)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
Until the spell ends, you create a passage extending into the target surface. When creating the passage you define its dimensions, as long as they do not exceed 5 feet in width, 8 feet in height, or 20 feet in depth. The appearance of the passage has no effect on the stability of the surrounding environment.  
Any creatures or objects within the passage when the spell ends are expelled without harm into unoccupied spaces near where the spell was cast.

**Rare: Trapped Passwall.** Within a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, the passage left by this spell (which can be as minimal as an inch depression) becomes trapped. Choose one of the following.  
*Slippy.* One side of the passage is covered in slippery soap. When a creature enters the passage’s area or first moves through the area on a turn it must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.  
*Sticky.* Goo covers one side of the passage, making it difficult terrain.  
*Subtle.* An illusion covers the passage making it appear as if nothing has happened to the target surface. The illusion does not hold up to physical inspection. To see through your illusion without physical inspection, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

# Pass Without Trace

*2nd-level (abjuration; nature, obscurement, utility)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** 30-foot radius  
**Components:** V, S, M (ashes of mistletoe and spruce)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
You and allies within the area gain advantage and an expertise die on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Creatures in the area leave behind no evidence of their passage.

# Pestilence

*Cantrip (conjuration; nature, summoning)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Area:** 10-foot sphere  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throws:** Constitution negates  
A swarm of insects fills the area. Creatures that begin their turn within the spell’s area or that enter the area for the first time on their turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage. The pests also ravage any unattended organic material within their radius, such as plant, wood, or fabric.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 10th level (3d4), and 15th level (4d4).

# Phantasmal Killer

*4th-level (illusion; arcane, fear, psychic)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 Feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom (special)  
You create an illusion that invokes the target’s deepest fears. Only the target can see this illusion. When the spell is cast and at the end of each of its turns, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw or takes 4d10 psychic damage and becomes frightened. The spell ends early when the target succeeds on its saving throw. A target that succeeds on its initial saving throw takes half damage.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

***Rare: Creeping Phantasmal Killer.*** When a target succeeds on its saving throw you may choose a new target for the spell. That target must make its own saving throw, and on a failure the spell continues without the expenditure of an additional spell slot, using the same duration.  
***Rare: Draining Phantasmal Killer.*** When a target is damaged by this spell, you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

# Phantasmal Talons

*1st-level (enchantment; psychic, unarmed)*  
**Classes:** Bard, warlock  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
Invisible talons of pure will sprout from your fingers. The talons do not interact with physical matter, but rip viciously at the psyche of any creature struck by them. For the duration, your unarmed strikes gain the finesse property and deal psychic damage. In addition, if your unarmed strike normally deals less than 1d4 damage, it instead deals 1d4 damage.

# Phantom Steed

*3rd-level (illusion; arcane, movement, summoning, utility)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute (ritual)  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
You create an illusory Large creature with an appearance determined by you that comes into being with all the necessary equipment needed to use it as a mount. This equipment vanishes when more than 10 feet away from the creature.  
You or any creature you allow may ride the steed, which uses the statistics for a riding horse but has a Speed of 100 feet and travels at 10 miles per hour at a steady pace (13 miles per hour at a fast pace).  
The steed vanishes if it takes damage (disappearing instantly) or you use an action to dismiss it (fading away, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount).

**Rare: Carting Phantom Steed.** Instead of conjuring a mount, you conjure a Large vehicle such as a boat, wagon, or cart. You decide on its appearance. If the vehicle normally requires horses, quasi-real beasts with an appearance of your choosing are conjured along with it. The vehicle can transport up to 6 Medium creatures.  
**Rare: Stalwart Phantom Steed.** If the steed takes damage and disappears, you can use an action to resummon it as long as you are not in combat and the original duration has not passed. The steed follows all other restrictions of the original spell.

# Planar Ally

*6th-level (conjuration; divine, planar, summoning)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, warlock  
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
A supernatural entity or your choice answers your call for assistance. The entity sends forth a servant to aid you in your endeavors. If you have a specific servant in mind you may speak its name during the casting, but ultimately who is sent to answer your call is the entity’s decision.  
The creature that appears (a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend), is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way other than how its nature and personality direct it. Any request made of the creature, simple or complex, requires an equal amount of payment which you must bargain with the creature to ascertain. The creature can request either items, sacrifices, or services in exchange for its assistance. A creature that you cannot communicate with cannot be bargained with.  
A task that can be completed in minutes is worth 100 gold per minute, a task that requires hours is worth 1,000 gold per hour, and a task requiring days is worth 10,000 gold per day (the creature can only accept tasks contained within a 10 day timeframe). A creature can often be persuaded to lower or raise prices depending on how a task aligns with its personality and the goals of its master—some require no payment at all if the task is deemed worthy. Additionally, a task that poses little or no risk only requires half the usual amount of payment, and an extremely dangerous task might call for double the usual payment. Still, only extreme circumstances will cause a creature summoned this way to accept tasks with a near certain result of death.  
A creature returns to its place of origin when a task is completed or if you fail to negotiate an agreeable task and payment. Should a creature join your party, it counts as a member of the group and receives a full portion of any experience gained.

***Rare: Forbidden Planar Ally.*** The spell allows the summoning of an aberration.  
**Rare: Cruel Planar Ally.** The creature summoned by this spell is always a fiend linked to you. The bargaining costs for all requests made with the fiend are halved, but in exchange the fiend uses the link to gain advantage on saving throws and checks made to avoid being banished or bound, it has resistance to all damage, and each time the fiend takes damage you take an equal amount of damage. Damage inflicted by this spell cannot kill you.

# Planar Binding

*5th-level (abjuration; arcane, compulsion, divine, nature, planar, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric, druid, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend  
**Components:** V, S, M (jewel worth at least 1,000 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
**Saving Throw:** Charisma negates  
The target must remain within range for the entire casting of the spell (usually by means of a *magic circle* spell). Until the spell ends, you force the target to serve you. If the target was summoned through some other means, like a spell, the duration of the original spell is extended to match this spell’s duration.  
Once it is bound to you the target serves as best it can and follows your orders, but only to the letter of the instruction. A hostile or malevolent target actively seeks to take any advantage of errant phrasing to suit its nature. When a target completes a task you’ve assigned to it, if you are on the same plane of existence the target travels back to you to report it has done so. Otherwise, it returns to where it was bound and remains there until the spell ends.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 6th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 10 days. When using a 7th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 30 days. When using an 8th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 180 days. When using a 9th-level spell slot, its duration increases to a year and a day.

**Rare: Star Sign Planar Binding.** The spell can also target an aberration.

# Plane Shift

*7th-level (conjuration; arcane, divine, nature, planar, teleportation, utility)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature, or you and up to 8 willing creatures linking hands in a circle  
**Components:** V, S, M (metal rod attuned to a particular plane of existence worth 250 gold)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous or Concentration (1 minute)  
Willing targets are transported to a plane of existence that you choose. If the destination is generally described, targets arrive near that destination in a location chosen by the Narrator. If you know the correct sequence of an existing teleportation circle (see *teleportation circle*), you can choose it as the destination (when the designated circle is too small for all targets to fit, any additional targets are shunted to the closest unoccupied spaces).  
Alternatively this spell can be used offensively to banish an unwilling target. You make a melee spell attack and on a hit the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a random location on a plane of existence that you choose. Once the target is transported, you must spend 1 minute concentrating on this spell or the target returns to the last space it occupied (otherwise it must find its own way back).

# Plant Growth

*3rd-level (transmutation; nature, plants, terrain)*  
**Classes:** Bard, druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (rapid) or 8 hours (enlarged)  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 100-foot radius (rapid) or half-mile radius (enlarged)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You channel vitality into vegetation to achieve one of the following effects, chosen when casting the spell.  
**Enlarged:** Plants in the area are greatly enriched. Any harvests of the affected plants provide twice as much food as normal.  
**Rapid:** All nonmagical plants in the area surge with the power of life. A creature that moves through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size from being affected.

**Rare: Overwhelming Plant Growth.** This spell doesn’t require the presence of pre-existing vegetation to take effect, but must use the Rapid option, and plants that appear only last for a day before fading away.

# Poison Skin 

*3rd-level (abjuration; nature, poison, protection)*  
**Classes:** Druid, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (handful of frog spawn)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
The target becomes poisonous to the touch. Until the spell ends, whenever a creature within 5 feet of the target damages the target with a melee weapon attack, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned and takes 1d6 ongoing poison damage. A poisoned creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
The target of the spell also becomes bright and multicolored like a poisonous dart frog, giving it disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The target’s skin is also covered in mucus, giving it advantage on saving throws and checks made to resist being grappled or restrained. In addition, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

# Polymorph

*4th-level (transmutation; affliction, arcane, beasts, nature, shapechanging, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Bard, druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One creature with at least 1 hit point that is not a shapechanger  
**Components:** V, S, M (cocoon)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
The target’s body is transformed into a beast with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the target doesn’t have a Challenge Rating, use its level.  
Until the spell ends or it is dropped to 0 hit points, the target’s game statistics (including its hit points and mental ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can’t speak or cast spells. The target’s gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form.  
When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell’s effects on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

# Power Word Kill

*9th-level (enchantment; arcane, attack)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
With but a word you snuff out the target’s life and it immediately dies. If you cast this on a creature with more than 100 hit points, it instead takes 50 damage.

**Rare: Sacrificial Power Word Kill.** When a target dies from the effects of this spell, you may use its life force to save yourself. For the next 8 hours, the first time you would drop to 0 hit points or be outright killed, you instead drop to 1 hit point. Once this effect is used, the life force is expended and the effect ends.

# Power Word Stun

*8th-level (enchantment; affliction, arcane)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Saving Throws:** Constitution (special)  
You utter a powerful word that stuns a target with 150 hit points or less. At the end of the target’s turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw to end the effect. If the target has more than 150 hit points, it is instead rattled until the end of its next turn.

**Rare: Maiming Power Word Stun.** When a target succeeds on its saving throw, its movement is halved and it is either blinded or deafened (your choice) until the end of its next turn.

# Prayer of Healing

*2nd-level (evocation; divine, good, healing)*  
**Classes:** Cleric  
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Up to six creatures that are not constructs or undead  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
The targets regain hit points equal to 2d8 \+ your spellcasting ability modifier.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The hit points regained increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Rare: Fell Prayer of Healing.** After casting this spell, the targets gain temporary hit points equal to the amount healed.

# Prestidigitation

*Cantrip (transmutation; arcane, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Up to 1 hour  
You wield arcane energies to produce minor effects. Choose one of the following:

* create a single burst of magic that manifests to one of the senses (for example a burst of sound, sparks, or an odd odor).  
* clean or soil an object of 1 cubic foot or less.  
* light or snuff a flame.  
* chill, warm, or flavor nonliving material of  
  1 cubic foot or less for 1 hour.  
* color or mark an object or surface for 1 hour.  
* create an ordinary trinket or illusionary image that fits in your hand and lasts for 1 round.

You may cast this spell multiple times, though only three effects may be active at a time. Dismissing each effect requires an action.

# Prismatic Spray

*7th-level (evocation; arcane, prismatic)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** 60-foot cone  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Saving Throw:** Dexterity halves damage or negates a condition  
You unleash 8 rays of light, each with a different purpose and effect. For each target in the area, roll a d8 to determine the ray that affects it.  
**1—***Red:* The target takes 10d6 fire damage.  
**2—***Orange:* The target takes 10d6  
acid damage.  
**3—***Yellow:* The target takes 10d6  
lightning damage.  
**4—***Green:* The target takes 10d6  
poison damage.  
**5—***Blue:* The target takes 10d6 cold damage.  
**6—***Indigo:* The target is restrained and at the end of each of its turns it makes a Constitution saving throw. Once it accumulates two failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it accumulates two successful saves the effect ends.  
**7—***Violet:* The target is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the target is banished to another random plane and is no longer blind. If it originated from another plane it returns there, while other creatures are generally cast into the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane.  
**8—***Special:* The target is hit by two rays. Roll a d8 twice to determine which rays, rerolling any 8s.

# Prismatic Wall

*9th-level (abjuration; arcane, prismatic, protection)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Area:** 15-foot radius sphere, or 90-foot long wall that is 30 feet high and 1 inch thick  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
You create a nontransparent barrier of prismatic energy that sheds bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you choose at the time of casting are immune to the barrier’s effects and may pass through it at will.  
The barrier can be created as either a vertical wall or a sphere. If the wall intersects a space occupied by a creature the spell fails, you lose your action, and the spell slot is wasted.  
When a creature that can see the barrier moves within 20 feet of the area or starts its turn within 20 feet of the area, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.  
The wall has 7 layers, each layer of a different color in order from red to violet. Once a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration of the spell. To pass or reach through the barrier a creature does so one layer at a time and must make a Dexterity saving throw for each layer or be subjected to that layer’s effects. On a successful save, any damage taken from a layer is reduced by half.  
A *rod of cancellation* can destroy a *prismatic wall*, but an *antimagic field* has no effect.  
*Red:* The creature takes 10d6 fire damage. While active, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t penetrate the barrier. The layer is destroyed by 25 cold damage.  
*Orange:* The creature takes 10d6 acid damage. While active, magical ranged attacks can’t penetrate the barrier. The layer is destroyed by strong winds.  
*Yellow:* The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage. This layer is destroyed by 60 force damage.  
*Green:* The creature takes 10d6 poison damage. A *passwall* spell, or any spell of equal or greater level which can create a portal on a solid surface, destroys the layer.  
*Blue:* The creature takes 10d6 cold damage. This layer is destroyed by 25 fire damage.  
*Indigo:* The creature is restrained and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Once it accumulates three failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it accumulates three successful saves the effect ends. This layer can be destroyed by bright light, such as that created by the *daylight* spell or a spell of equal or greater level.  
*Violet:* The creature is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the creature is banished to another random plane and is no longer blind. If it originated from another plane it returns there, while other creatures are generally cast into the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane. This layer can be destroyed by *dispel magic* or a similar spell of equal or greater level capable of ending spells or magical effects.

# Private Sanctum

*scrying, utility)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** Cube of at least 5 feet or up to 100 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (sheet of lead, piece of glass, wad of cotton or cloth, powdered chrysolite)  
**Duration:** 24 Hours  
You increase the magical security in an area, choosing one or more of the following:

* sound cannot pass the edge of the area.  
* light and vision cannot pass the edge of the area.  
* sensors created by divination spells can neither enter the area nor appear within it.  
* creatures within the area cannot be targeted by divination spells.  
* nothing can teleport into or out of the area.  
* planar travel is impossible within the area.

Casting this spell on the same area every day for a year makes the duration permanent.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** Increase the size of the sanctum by up to 100 feet for each slot level above 4th.

# Produce Flame

*Cantrip (conjuration; attack, fire, nature, utility)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
You create a flame in your hand which lasts until the spell ends and does no harm to you or your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.  
The spell ends when you dismiss it, cast it again, or attack with the flame. As part of casting the spell or as an action on a following turn, you can fling the flame at a creature within 30 feet, making a ranged spell attack that deals 1d8 fire damage.  
This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Rare: Charged Produce Flame.** You conjure a ball of lightning in your hand instead of flame. The ball of lightning produces bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and when flung deals lightning damage instead of fire damage.

# Programmed Illusion

*6th-level (illusion; arcane, senses)*  
**Classes:** Bard, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 30-foot cube  
**Components:** V, S, M (some fleece and jade dust worth 25 gold)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled  
You craft an illusory object, creature, or other effect which executes a scripted performance when a specific condition is met within 30 feet of the area. You must describe both the condition and the details of the performance upon casting. The trigger must be based on something that can be seen or heard.  
Once the illusion triggers, it runs its performance for up to 5 minutes before it disappears and goes dormant for 10 minutes. The illusion is undetectable until then and only reactivates when the condition is triggered and after the dormant period has passed.  
A creature can use an action to attempt an Investigation check against your spell save DC to reveal the spell’s illusory nature. Physical interactions reveal the illusion for what it is as things can pass through it with ease. A creature aware of the illusion perceives the image as transparent and the sounds it generates hollow.

# Project Image

*7th-level (illusion; arcane, chaos, senses)*  
**Classes:** Bard, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Special (500 miles)  
**Components:** V, S, M (replica of yourself made from materials worth 5 gold)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 day)  
You create an illusory duplicate of yourself that looks and sounds like you but is intangible. The duplicate can appear anywhere within range as long as you have seen the space before.  
You can use an action to move this duplicate up to twice your Speed and make it speak and behave in whatever way you choose, mimicking your mannerism with perfect accuracy. You can use a bonus action to see through your duplicate’s eyes and hear through its ears until the beginning of your next turn. During this time, you are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings.  
A creature can use an action to attempt an Investigation check against your spell save DC to reveal the spell’s illusory nature. Physical interactions reveal the illusion for what it is as things can pass through it with ease. A creature aware of the illusion perceives the image as transparent and the sounds it generates hollow.

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One willing creature  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

**Cast at Higher Levels***.* For each slot level above 2nd, the target gains resistance to one additional type of damage listed above, with a maximum number equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

# Protection from Evil and Good

*1st-level (abjuration; arcane, divine, protection)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, herald, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One willing creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
The target is protected against the following types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target and are unable to charm, frighten, or possess the target. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against that effect.

# Protection from Poison

*2nd-level (abjuration; divine, nature, negation, protection)*  
**Classes:** Druid, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S  
Duration: 1 hour  
The target has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and resistance to poison damage. Additionally, if the target is poisoned, you negate one poison affecting it. If more than one poison affects the target, you negate one poison you know is present (otherwise you negate one at random).

# Purify Food and Drink

*1st-level (transmutation; divine, nature, negation)*  
**Classes:** Druid, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Area:** 5-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, S

**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components**: V, M (bauble, curio, or toy worth at least 20 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
You unleash the discipline of your magical training and let arcane power burn from your fists. Until the spell ends you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and on each of your turns you can use an action to make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet, dealing 4d8 force damage on a successful hit.  
For the duration, you cannot cast other spells or concentrate on other spells. The spell ends early if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end this spell early on your turn as a bonus action.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a spell slot of 5th- or 6th-level, the damage increases to 5d8. When using a spell slot of 7th- or 8th-level, the damage increases to 6d8. When using a spell slot of 9th-level, the damage increases to 7d8.

## Raise Dead

*5th-level (necromancy; divine, healing)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature that died within the last 10 days  
**Components:** V, S, M (diamond worth at least 500 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You return the target to life, provided its soul is willing and able to return to its body. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point. The spell cannot return an undead creature to life.  
The spell cures any poisons and nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time of death. It does not remove any magical diseases, curses, or other magical effects; these must be removed prior to the spell being cast, otherwise they immediately take effect when the creature returns to life.  
The spell does not regrow limbs or organs, and it automatically fails if the target is missing any body parts necessary for life (like its heart or head).  
Being raised from the dead takes a toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The target suffers 3 levels of fatigue and strife. At the conclusion of each long rest, the target removes one level of fatigue and strife until the target completely recovers.

# Raise Hell

*9th-level (transmutation; evil, law, terrain)*  
**Classes:** Warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** Up to a 300-foot sphere  
**Components:** V, S, M (drop of blood from a fallen angel, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Concentration (24 hours)  
You transform the land around you into a blasted hellscape. When you cast the spell, all nonmagical vegetation in the area immediately dies. In addition, you can create any of the following effects within the area. Fiends are immune to these effects, as are any creatures you specify at the time you cast the spell. A successful *dispel magic* ends a single effect, not the entire area.  
*Brimstone Rubble.* You can fill any number of unoccupied 5-foot squares in the area with smoldering brimstone. These spaces become difficult terrain. A creature that enters an affected square or starts its turn there takes 2d10 fire damage.  
*Field of Fear.* Dread pervades the area. A creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a successful Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start its next turn. While frightened, a creature must take the Dash action to escape the area by the safest available route on each of its turns. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.  
*Spawning Pits.* The ground opens to create up to 6 pits filled with poisonous bile. Each pit fills a 10-foot cube that drops beneath the ground. When this spell is cast, any creature whose space is on a pit may make a Dexterity saving throw, moving to an unoccupied space next to the pit on a success. A creature that enters a pit or starts its turn there takes 15d6 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage immediately dies and rises as a lemure at the start of its next turn. Lemures created this way obey your verbal commands, but they disappear when the spell ends or if they leave the area for any reason.  
*Unhallowed Spires.* Up to four spires of black ice rise from the ground in unoccupied 10-foot squares within the area. Each spire can be up to 66 feet tall and is immune to all damage and magical effects. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of a spire would regain hit points, it does not regain hit points and instead takes 3d6 necrotic damage.  
If you maintain concentration on the spell for the full duration, the effects are permanent until dispelled.

# Ray of Enfeeblement

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (prayer wheel and holy water)

You return the target to life, provided the target’s soul is willing and able to return to its body. If you only have a piece of the target, the spell reforms a new adult body for the soul to inhabit. Once reincarnated the target remembers everything from its former life, and retains all its proficiencies, cultural traits, and class features. The target’s heritage traits change according to its new form. The Narrator chooses the form of the new body, or rolls on **Table: Reincarnation**.

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
This spell ends a curse inflicted with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower. If the curse was instead inflicted by a feature or trait, the spell ends a curse inflicted by a creature of Challenge Rating 6 or lower. If cast on a cursed object of Rare or lesser rarity, this spell breaks the owner’s attunement to the item (although it does not end the curse on the object).  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** For each slot level above 3rd, the spell ends a curse inflicted either by a spell one level higher or by a creature with a Challenge Rating two higher.

**Components:** V, S, M (spherical piece of clear crystal)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

The sphere can be destroyed without harming anyone inside by being dealt at least 15 force damage at once or by being targeted with a *dispel magic* spell cast using a 4th-level or higher spell slot. The sphere is immune to all other damage, and no spell effects, physical objects, or anything else can pass through, though a target can breathe while inside it. The target cannot be damaged by any attacks or effects originating from outside the sphere, and the target cannot damage anything outside of it.  
The target can use an action to roll the sphere at half its Speed. Similarly, the sphere can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

# Resistance

*Cantrip (abjuration; nature, protection)*  
**Classes:** Druid, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One willing creature

**Classes:** Bard, cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Target:** One creature that died within the last century from something other than old age  
**Components:** V, S, M (diamond worth at least 2,500 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
Provided the target’s soul is willing and able to return to its body, so long as it is not undead it returns to life with all of its hit points.  
The spell cures any poisons and nonmagical diseases that affected the target at the time of death. It does not remove any magical diseases, curses, or other magical effects; these must be removed prior to the spell being cast, otherwise they immediately take effect when the target returns to life. The spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.  
Being raised from the dead takes a toll on the body, mind, and spirit. The target takes a –4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. At the conclusion of each long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until the target completely recovers.  
Resurrecting a creature that has been dead for one year or longer is exhausting. Until you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Area:** 50-foot radius cylinder that is 100 feet high  
**Components:** V, S, M (lodestone and iron filings)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
Gravity reverses in the area. Any creatures or objects not anchored to the ground fall upward until they reach the top of the area. A creature may make a Dexterity saving throw to prevent the fall by grabbing hold of something. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered, the affected creatures and objects impact against it with the same force as a downward fall. When an object or creature reaches the top of the area, it remains suspended there until the spell ends.  
When the spell ends, all affected objects and creatures fall back down.

**Duration:** 1 hour  
One end of the target rope rises into the air until it hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end, a nearly imperceptible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that can fit up to 8 Medium or smaller creatures. The entrance can be reached by climbing the rope. Once inside, the rope can be pulled into the extradimensional space.  
No spells or attacks can cross into or out of the extradimensional space. Creatures inside the extradimensional space can see out of a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on its entrance. Creatures outside the space can spot the entrance with a Perception check against your spell save DC. If they can reach it, creatures can pass in and out of the space.  
When the spell ends, anything inside the extradimensional space falls to the ground.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).  
**Rare: Purifying Flame.** When a target damaged by this spell is undead, has the Evil trait, or is vulnerable to radiant damage, it is rattled for the next minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target may make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on itself.

This spell ends early when the target attacks or casts a spell that affects a creature against its will.

You can observe a specific creature that you choose. The difficulty of the saving throw for this spell is modified by your knowledge of the target and whether you possess a physical item with a connection to the target.  
On a failed save, you can see and hear the target through an invisible sensor that appears within 10 feet of it and moves with the target. Any creature who can see invisibility or rolls a critical success on its saving throw perceives the sensor as a fist-sized glowing orb hovering in the air. Creatures cannot see or hear you through the sensor.  
If you choose to target a location, the sensor appears at that location and is immobile.

While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, you can recall it to you at any point by using an action to touch the Tiny replica. The chest reappears in an unoccupied space on a surface within 5 feet of you. You can use an action at any time to return the chest to the Ethereal Plane so long as you are touching both the chest and its Tiny replica.  
This effect ends if you cast the spell again on a different chest, if the replica is destroyed, or if you use an action to end the spell.

Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage. Depending on the material component used, a seed bomb also causes one of the following additional effects:  
**Pinecone.** Seed shrapnel explodes outward. A creature in the area of the exploding seed bomb must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it be blinded until the end of its next turn.  
**Sunflower.** Seeds enlarge into a blanket of pointy needles. The area affected by the exploding seed bomb becomes difficult terrain for the next minute.

You can alter the appearance of the target as you see fit, including but not limited to: its heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex and any other distinguishing features. You cannot disguise the target as a creature of a different size category, and its limb structure remains the same.  
The disguise does not hold up to touch. To see through your disguise without such an interaction, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

# Sending

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Unlimited

**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (helm, crown, or circlet worth at least 1,500 gold placed on your head before the transformation)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
You take the form of a creature of a Challenge Rating equal to or lower than your level. The creature cannot be an undead or a construct, and it must be a creature you have seen. You change into the average version of that creature, and do not gain any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.  
Until the spell ends or you are dropped to 0 hit points, your statistics (except your Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores) are replaced by those of the chosen creature. You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies as well as gaining the creature’s, keeping the higher of the two if you share one in common. You keep all of your features, skills, and traits gained from your class, heritage, culture, background, or other sources, and can use them as long as the creature is physically able to do so. You do not keep any special senses, such as darkvision. You can only speak if the creature is typically capable of speech. You cannot use legendary actions or lair actions. Your gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with your form has no effect until you leave the form.  
When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If the spell’s effect on you ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form and knocks you unconscious if the damage reduces you to 0 hit points.  
Until the spell ends, you can use an action to change into another form of your choice. The new form follows all the rules as the previous form, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points than your previous form, you keep the previous form’s hit points.

**Rare: Malleable Form.** When you cast this spell, you can choose to add an additional physical trait or change one existing trait of the form you adopt. For example, you can add the wings of a roc to the form of a rhinoceros (gaining a fly speed of 120 feet), change the color of fur or scales, add a poisonous barb to the end of a tail, and so on.

Make a ranged spell attack for each orb. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage and the shards of broken glass remain suspended in midair, filling the area they occupy (or 5 feet of the space they occupy if the creature is Large-sized or larger) with shards of suspended broken glass. Whenever a creature enters an area of broken glass for the first time or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 slashing damage. The shards of broken glass dissolve into harmless wisps of sand and blow away after 1 minute.

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You create an illusory visual image of a creature, object, or other visible effect within the area. The illusion cannot produce sound or smell, and items and other creatures pass through it.  
As an action, you can move the image to any point within range. The image’s movement can be natural and lifelike.  
A creature that touches the image recognizes it as an illusion. A creature can also spend an action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to determine if the image is an illusion. On a success, it is able to see through the image.

# Simulacrum

*7th-level (illusion; arcane, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 12 hours  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time  
**Components:** V, S, M (a snow or ice copy of the target, a piece of the target’s body placed inside the snow or ice, and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gold spread over the duplicate, all consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled  
You sculpt an illusory duplicate of the target from ice and snow. The duplicate looks exactly like the target and uses all the statistics of the original, though it is formed without any gear, and has only half of the target’s hit point maximum. The duplicate is a creature and can take actions. If the target is able to cast spells, the duplicate cannot cast spells of 7th-level or higher.  
The duplicate is friendly to you and your allies. It follows your orders, and moves and acts on your turn in combat. It is a static creature and it does not learn, age, or grow, so it never increases in levels and cannot regain any spent spell slots.  
When the simulacrum is damaged you can repair it in an alchemy lab using components worth 100 gold per hit point it regains. When reduced to 0 hit points the simulacrum crumbles into snow and melts away immediately. The simulacrum is also destroyed if you cast this spell again.

# Sleep

*1st-level (enchantment; arcane, compulsion)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** 4d10 hit points worth of creatures  
**Area:** 20-foot radius  
**Components:** V, S, M (pinch of sand)  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
You put creatures into a deep enchanted sleep. Starting with the target with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets within the area fall unconscious in ascending order according to their hit points. Slumbering creatures stay asleep until the spell ends, they take damage, or someone uses an action to physically wake them.  
As each target falls asleep, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the next target. A target’s hit points must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any effect.  
If the spell puts no creatures to sleep, the creature in the area with the lowest hit point total is rattled until the beginning of its next turn.  
Constructs and undead are not affected by this spell.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell affects an additional 2d10 hit points worth of creatures for each slot level above 1st.

# Sleet Storm

*2nd-level (conjuration; cold, nature, terrain, weather)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 40-foot radius cylinder that is 20 feet high  
**Components:** V, S, M (few drops of melted snow)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You conjure a storm of freezing rain and sleet in the area. The ground in the area is covered with slippery ice that makes it difficult terrain, exposed flames in the area are extinguished, and the area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.  
When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on a turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration.

# Slow

*3rd-level (transmutation; arcane, movement,*  
*negation, time)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Target:** Up to six creatures of your choice  
**Area:** 40-foot cube  
**Components:** V, S, M (drop of molasses)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
A target that fails its saving throw is slowed. On a successful saving throw, a target is instead rattled until the end of its next turn. At the end of each of its turns, a slowed target repeats the saving throw to end the spell’s effect on it.   
If a slowed target casts a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the target doesn’t finish casting the spell until its next turn. The target must use its action on that turn to complete the spell or the spell fails.

# Soulwrought Fists

*2nd-level (transmutation; enhancement, transformation, unarmed, weaponry)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (handful of iron filings)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
**Saving Throw:** Constitution negates  
The target’s hands harden with inner power, turning dexterous fingers into magical iron cudgels. Until the spell ends, the target drops anything it is holding and cannot use its hands to grasp objects or perform complex tasks. A target can still cast any spell that does not specifically require its hands. When making unarmed strikes, the target can use its spellcasting ability or Dexterity (its choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In addition, the target’s unarmed strikes deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

# Spare the Dying

*Cantrip (necromancy; divine, healing)*  
**Classes:** Cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One living creature with 0 hit points  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
A jolt of healing energy flows through the target and it becomes stable.

**Rare: Costly Spare the Dying.** For the next 3 rounds, at the start of its turn the target rolls 1d20, regaining 1 hit point on a result of 20\. Whether or not it regains any hit points, for the next 24 hours the target is rattled.

# Speak with Animals

*1st-level (divination; beasts, communication, nature, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
You call upon the secret lore of beasts and gain the ability to speak with them. Beasts have a different perspective of the world, and their knowledge and awareness is filtered through that perspective. Typically, beasts are aware of locations and creatures near the area they live in, and events that transpired near them recently. At the Narrator’s discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you.

**Rare: Insightful Speak with Animals.** So long as your spell save DC is higher than the passive Insight score of a beast you are conversing with, you can use an action to view the memories of an event the beast is describing.

# Speak with Dead

*3rd-level (necromancy; communication, divine,*  
*knowledge, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One corpse  
**Components:** V, S, M ( incense)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
You call forth the target’s memories, animating it enough to answer 5 questions. The corpse’s knowledge is limited: it knows only what it knew in life and cannot learn new information or speak about anything that has occurred since its death. It speaks only in the languages it knew, and doesn’t need to give a truthful answer if it has reason not to. Answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive.  
This spell does not return a departed soul, nor does it have any effect on an undead corpse, or one without a mouth.

# Speak with Plants

*3rd-level (transmutation; communication, nature, plants, utility)*  
**Classes:** Bard, druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Target:** Plants in a 30-foot radius  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
Your voice takes on a magical timbre, awakening the targets to limited sentience. Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate with you and follow simple commands, telling you about recent events including creatures that have passed, weather, and nearby locations.  
The targets have a limited mobility: they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks freely. This allows them to turn ordinary terrain into difficult terrain, or make difficult terrain caused by vegetation into ordinary terrain for the duration as vines and branches move at your request. This spell can also release a creature restrained by an *entangle* spell.  
At the Narrator’s discretion the targets may be able to perform other tasks, though each must remain rooted in place. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it but it is not compelled to follow your requests.

**Rare: Insightful Speak with Plants.** So long as your spell save DC is higher than the passive Insight score of a plant you are conversing with, you can use an action to view the memories of an event the plant is describing.

# Spider Climb

*2nd-level (transmutation; arcane, movement, utility)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One willing creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (cobweb and small  
wooden shoe)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
The target gains the ability to walk on walls and upside down on ceilings, as well as a climbing speed equal to its base Speed.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You can affect one additional target for each slot level above 2nd.

**Rare: Sure-Footed Spider Climb.** The target automatically succeeds on ability checks and saving throws made to keep its balance.

# Spike Growth

*2nd-level (transmutation; nature, terrain)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 20-foot radius  
**Components:** V, S, M (a thorned branch)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You cause sharp spikes and thorns to sprout in the area, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters or moves within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.  
Your magic causes the ground to look natural. A creature that can’t see the area when the spell is cast can spot the hazardous terrain just before entering it by making a Perception check against your spell save DC.

**Rare: Sneaky Spike Growth.** The spikes and thorns created by this spell are invisible and a creature cannot perceive them until it has been damaged by this spell.

# Spirit Guardians

*3rd-level (conjuration; divine, necrotic, radiant)*  
**Classes:** Cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** 10-foot radius  
**Components:** V, S, M (holy symbol)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom halves damage  
You call down spirits of divine fury, filling the area with flitting spectral forms. You choose the form taken by the spirits.  
Creatures of your choice halve their Speed while in the area. When an affected creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 3d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice).

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

# Spiritual Weapon

*2nd-level (evocation; attack, divine, force)*  
**Classes:** Cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
You create a levitating, incandescent weapon with an appearance of your choosing and use it to attack your enemies. On the round you cast it, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon that deals force damage equal to 1d8 \+ your spellcasting ability modifier.  
As a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and make another attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

**Rare: Fell Spiritual Weapon.** The weapon deals necrotic damage instead of force damage, and when it scores a critical hit its target is rattled until the end of your next turn.

# Sporesight

*7th-level (evocation; nature, obscurement, senses)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Area:** 50-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, S, M (toadstool)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You throw a mushroom at a point within range and detonate it, creating a cloud of spores that fills the area. The cloud of spores travels around corners, and the area is considered lightly obscured for everyone except you. Creatures and objects within the area are covered in spores.  
Until the spell ends, you know the exact location of all affected objects and creatures. Any attack roll you make against an affected creature or object has advantage, and the affected creatures and objects can’t benefit from being invisible.

**Rare: Poisonous Sporesight.** Choose a number of creatures in the area equal to your proficiency bonus. Any other creature that starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 poison damage on a failed save.

# Stinking Cloud

*3rd-level (conjuration; arcane, poison)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 20-foot radius sphere  
**Components:** V, S, M (rotten egg or dried fish scale)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You create a roiling, noxious cloud that hinders creatures and leaves them retching. The cloud spreads around corners and lingers in the air until the spell ends.  
The area is heavily obscured. A creature in the area at the start of its turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or use its action to retch and reel. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on the save.  
The cloud is dispersed by  moderate winds (10 miles per hour)  after 4 rounds, and by strong winds (20 miles per hour) after 1 round.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell’s area increases by 5 feet for every 2 slot levels above 3rd.

**Rare: Dyed Stinking Cloud.** Choose a color for the cloud when you cast this spell. When a creature makes a saving throw against this spell it is dyed that color until it uses an action to wipe away the residue.

# Stone Shape

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One stone object of Medium size or smaller, or a 5-foot section of stone  
**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay shaped as part of the spell)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You reshape the target into any form you choose. For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or chest, make a small passage through a walls less than 5 feet thick, seal a stone door shut, or create a hiding place. The target can have up to two hinges and a latch, but more complex mechanics aren’t possible.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You may select one additional target for every slot level above 4th.

# Stoneskin

*4th-level (abjuration; arcane, nature, protection)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One willing creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
Until the spell ends, the target’s skin becomes as hard as stone and the target gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 7th-level spell slot, the target gains resistance to magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

# Storm Kick

*5th-level (transmutation; lightning, movement, thunder, unarmed)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You must be able to move in order to cast this spell. You leap into the air and flash across the battlefield, arriving feet-first with the force of a thunderbolt. As part of casting this spell, make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within range. If you hit, you instantly flash to an open space of your choosing adjacent to the target, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 \+ your spellcasting modifier plus 3d8 thunder damage and 6d8 lightning damage. If your unarmed strike normally uses a larger die, use that instead of a d6. If you miss, you may still choose to teleport next to the target.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 6th-level spell slot or higher, if you are able to make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, you may make an additional melee weapon attack against the target. When using a 7th-level spell slot, you may choose an additional target within 30 feet of the target for each spell slot level above 6th, forcing each additional target to make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d8 lightning damage.

# Storm of Vengeance

*9th-level (conjuration; acid, cold, lightning, nature, storm, thunder, weather)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Special (sight)  
**Target:** 360-foot radius area that is up to 5,000 feet in the air  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You conjure a storm cloud that covers the target area. As it forms, lightning and thunder mix with howling winds, and each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 thunder damage and become deafened for 5 minutes.  
Until the spell ends, at the start of your turn the cloud produces additional effects:  
**Round 2\.** Acid rain falls throughout the area dealing 1d6 acid damage to each creature and object beneath the cloud.  
**Round 3\.** Lightning bolts strike up to 6 creatures or objects of your choosing that are beneath the cloud (no more than one bolt per creature or object). A creature struck by this lightning makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.  
**Round 4\.** Heavy hail falls throughout the area dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature beneath the cloud.  
**Round 5–10.** Freezing rain and roiling winds turn the area beneath the cloud into difficult terrain that is heavily obscured. Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss while a creature or its target are beneath the cloud. When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn beneath the cloud or enters into the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration. Gusts of strong winds between 20–50 miles per hour automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar effects (whether mundane or magical). Finally, each creature beneath the cloud takes 1d6 cold damage.

# Suggestion

**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, M (miniature bottle of red wine and some soap)  
**Duration:** Concentration (8 hours)  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. Suggest an activity phrased in one to two sentences. The target is magically influenced to follow that course of activity. The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable. Asking the target to perform an action that is obviously harmful to it ends the spell.  
The target carries out the activity suggested by you as well as it can until it completes the activity or the spell ends.  
You may specify trigger conditions that cause the target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.   
Any damage done to the target by you or one of your allies ends the spell for that creature.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 4th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours. When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 7 days. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 year. When using a 9th-level spell slot, the suggestion lasts until it is dispelled. Any use of a 5th-level or higher spell slot grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.

negates blindness  
Oozes and undead have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist this spell. Radiant sunlight streaks from your hand. Each creature in the area takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 round.  
Until the spell ends, you can use an action on subsequent turns to create a new beam of sunlight.  
 A mote of brilliant radiance lingers on your hand until the spell ends, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using an 8th-level spell slot the damage increases by 1d8.

**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Saving Throw:** Constitution halves and  
negates blindness  
Oozes and undead have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist this spell. You create a burst of radiant sunlight that fills the area. Each creature in the area takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded by this spell repeats its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a successful save.  
This spell dispels any magical darkness in its area. This light is sunlight.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 9th-level spell slot the damage increases by 2d6.

**Rare: Disorienting Sunburst.** A creature that takes 50 or more damage from this spell is confused. At the start of each of its turns, a creature confused by this spell makes an Intelligence saving throw, ending that effect on itself on a success.

**Components:** V, S, M (alchemical ingredients and powdered gemstones with a total value of at least 1,000 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered  
You inscribe a potent glyph on the target, setting a magical trap for your enemies. If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends. Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Investigation check against your spell save DC.  
Describe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the spell, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph. The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it. You can specify certain creatures which don’t trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.  
When triggered, the glyph sheds dim light in a 60-foot radius for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Each creature within the sphere’s area is targeted by the glyph, as are creatures that enter the sphere for the first time on a turn.  
When you cast the spell, choose one of the following effects.  
Death: Creatures in the area make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.  
Discord: Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or bicker and squabble with other creatures for 1 minute. While bickering, a creature cannot meaningfully communicate and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.  
Confused: Creatures in the area must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become confused for 1 minute.  
Fear: Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, a creature drops anything it is holding and must try to move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns.

Sleep: Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. A sleeping creature awakens if it takes damage or an action is used to wake it.  
Stunning: Creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute.

# Tearful Sonnet

*4th-level (enchantment; compulsion, psychic, sound)*  
**Classes:** Bard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** 20-foot radius  
**Components:** V, S, M (whole onion)  
**Duration:** Concentration (3 rounds)  
You play a song that fills creatures with magical sorrow. Each creature in the area makes a Charisma saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 psychic damage, it spends its action that turn crying, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition automatically succeed on this saving throw.  
If a creature other than you hears the entire song (remaining within the spell’s area from the casting through the duration) it is so wracked with sadness that it is stunned for 1d4 rounds.  
You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.

**Rare: Pervading Tearful Sonnet.** This spell deals double the normal damage against frightened creatures.

# Telekinesis

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One Huge or smaller creature or object  
(up to 1,000 pounds)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You move the target with the power of your mind. Until the spell ends you can use an action on subsequent turns to pick a new target or continue to affect the same target. Depending on whether you target a creature or an object, the spell has the following effects:  
**Creature:** The target makes a Strength check against your spell save DC or it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond the range of the spell.  
**Object:** You move the target 30 feet in any direction. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If the target fails, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of the spell.  
You can use *telekinesis* to finely manipulate objects as though you were using them yourself—you can open doors and unscrew lids, dip a quill in ink and make it write, and so on.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using an 8th-level spell slot, this spell does not require your concentration.

# Telepathic Bond

*5th-level (evocation; arcane, communication, telepathy)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Up to eight willing creatures of Intelligence 3 or higher  
**Components:** V, S, M (two matching cards from different decks)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
Until the spell ends, a telepathic link connects the minds of the targets. So long as they remain on the same plane of existence, targets may communicate telepathically with each other regardless of language and across any distance.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell’s duration increases by 1d4 hours for each slot level above 5th.

**Rare: Exceptional Telepathic Bond.** This spell functions even when targets are on different planes of existence.

# Teleport

*7th-level (conjuration; arcane, teleportation)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Same plane  
**Target:** You and up to 8 willing creatures within 10 feet of you, or a single unattended object that fits entirely inside a 10-foot cube  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You teleport the targets instantly across vast distances. When you cast this spell, choose a destination. You must know the location you’re teleporting to, and it must be on the same plane of existence.  
Teleportation is difficult magic and you may arrive off-target or somewhere else entirely depending on how familiar you are with the location you’re teleporting to. When you teleport, the Narrator rolls 1d100 and consults Table: Teleport Familiarity.  
Familiarity is determined as follows:  
**Permanent Circle:** A permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know (see *teleportation circle*).  
**Associated Object:** You have an object taken from the target location within the last 6 months.  
**Very Familiar:** A place you have frequented, carefully studied, or can see at the time you cast the spell.  
**Seen Casually:** A place you have seen more than once but don’t know well.  
**Viewed Once:** A place you have seen once, either in person or via magic.  
**Description:** A place you only know from someone else’s description (whether spoken, written, or even marked on a map).  
**False Destination:** A place that doesn’t actually exist.

Your arrival is determined as follows:  
**On Target:** You and your targets arrive exactly where you mean to.  
**Off Target:** You and your targets arrive some distance away from the target in a random direction. The further you travel, the further away you are likely to arrive. You arrive off target by a number of miles equal to 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the total distance of your trip. If you tried to travel 1,000 miles and roll a 2 and 4 on the d10s, you land 6 percent off target and arrive 60 miles away from your intended destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 to randomly determine the direction: 1—north, 2—northeast, 3—east, 4—southeast, 5—south, 6—southwest, 7—west, 8—northwest.  
**Similar Location:** You and your targets arrive in a different location that somehow resembles the target area. If you tried to teleport to your favorite inn, you might end up at a different inn, or in a room with much of the same decor. Typically you appear at the closest similar location, but not always.  
**Mishap:** The spell’s magic goes awry, and each teleporting creature or object takes 3d10 force damage. The Narrator rerolls on the table to determine where you arrive. When multiple mishaps occur targets take damage each time.

# Teleportation Circle

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casti**ng Time: 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Area:** 10-foot diameter circle  
**Components:** V, M (rare pigments worth 50 gold, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** 1 round  
You draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground and open within it a shimmering portal to a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere in the world. The portal remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly travels to the destination circle.  
Permanent teleportation circles are commonly found within royal palaces, major centers of commerce, and other important locations. Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in a certain pattern called a sigil sequence.  
When you cast *teleportation circle*, you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle you know. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the Narrator. You can learn a new sigil sequence with 1 minute of observation and study.  
Casting the spell in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent teleportation circle with its own unique sigil sequence. You do not need to teleport when casting the spell to make a permanent destination.

The dome prevents inclement weather and environmental effects from passing through it, though creatures and objects may pass through freely. Spells and other magical effects can’t cross the dome in either direction, and the dome provides a comfortable dry interior no matter the conditions outside of it. You can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark at any time on your turn.  
The spell fails if a Large or larger creature or more than 10 creatures are inside the affected area when you cast the spell. The spell ends when you leave the dome or if more than 10 creatures enter the dome.

**Components:** V, M (clay model of a tower)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
The target understands any words it hears, and when the target speaks its words are understood by creatures that know at least one language.

# Transport via Plants

*6th-level (conjuration; divine, nature, plants,*  
*teleportation)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** Large or larger inanimate plant  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration:** 1 round  
You create a magical pathway between the target and a second plant that you’ve seen or touched before that is on the same plane of existence. Any creature can step into the target and exit from the second plant by using 5 feet of movement.

# Traveler’s Ward

*1st-level (abjuration; protection, sound)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric, herald, wizard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (well-polished ball bearing)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
Until the spell ends, creatures have disadvantage on Sleight of Hand checks made against the target. If a creature fails a Sleight of Hand check to steal from the target, the ward creates a loud noise and a flash of bright light easily heard and seen by creatures within 100 feet.

*5th-level (conjuration; divine, nature, plants,*  
*teleportation)*  
**Classes:** Druid

You may step back outside of the original tree or spend 5 more feet of movement to appear within a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, but you must end your turn outside of a tree. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** Target one additional creature within reach for each slot level above 5th.

# True Polymorph

*9th-level (transmutation; arcane, shapechanging, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Bard, warlock, wizard

**Target:** One unattended nonmagical object or one creature with at least 1 hit point that is not a shapechanger  
**Components**: V, S, M (mercury, gum arabic, smoke)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
**Saving Throw**: Wisdom negates  
The target is transformed until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends. You can make the transformation permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration.  
**Creature into Creature:** The target’s body is transformed into a creature with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the target doesn’t have a Challenge Rating, use its level.  
The target’s game statistics (including its hit points and mental ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can’t speak or cast spells, though its personality remains unchanged. If the target is changed into a creature with an alignment trait, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it gains that alignment trait for the duration of the spell. Otherwise, it keeps its own alignment trait.  
 The target’s gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target’s form has no effect until it leaves the form.  
When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell’s effects on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.  
**Object into Creature:** The target is transformed into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size isn’t larger than the object’s size and it has a Challenge Rating of 9 or less. The creature is friendly to you and your allies and acts on each of your turns, but only . you dictate its actions and movement. However, the Narrator resolves the creature’s actions and movement and has its statistics.  
If the spell becomes permanent, your control over the creature ends. At this point its attitude towards you is determined by how you treated it previously.  
**Creature into Object:** You turn the target and whatever it is wearing and carrying into an object. The target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen object and it retains no memory of this time. When the spell ends it reverts to its previous form.

The spell ends the effects of any poison, disease, or curses that affected the target at the time of death (with the exception of those caused by *enduring bestow curse*), closes any wounds, and restores any missing body parts.  
If no body (or body parts) exist, you can still cast the spell but must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you. This option requires diamonds worth at least 50,000 gold (consumed by the spell).

The duration increases to Concentration (1 minute) and you gain advantage to three additional attack rolls of your choice that are made before the spell ends.

You conjure a meteor which explodes at a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see the point where the meteor explodes.  
Each creature within range that can see the meteor (other than you) makes a Dexterity saving throw or is blinded until the end of your next turn. Fiery chunks of the meteor then plummet to the ground at different areas you choose within range. Each creature in an area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in more than one area is affected only once.  
The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

# Unseen Servant

**Classes:** Bard, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Components:** V, S, M (string and wood)

You can use a bonus action to mentally command it to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending surfaces and objects, serving a meal, doing laundry, and the like. Once given a command the servant performs the task to completion, then waits for its next command.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** You create an additional servant for each slot level above 1st.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

# Vicious Mockery

*Cantrip (enchantment; arcane, attack, psychic)*  
**Classes:** Bard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates  
You verbally insult or mock the target so viciously its mind is seared. As long as the target hears you (understanding your words is not required) it takes 1d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.  
The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

**Rare: Taunting Vicious Mockery.** Your amazingly effective insults and mockeries also entertain others—even the target’s allies. On a failed saving throw the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls next round, and if it makes an attack it can only target you (it can take other actions, but if the target takes the Attack action or casts a spell that includes a spell attack, that attack must be against you). Persuasion checks you make against the target have disadvantage, even after the spell’s duration ends.

# Wall of Fire

*4th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, divine, fire, protection)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorus powder)

The wall blocks sight.  
When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.  
One side of the wall (chosen when the spell is cast) deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature also takes that damage when it enters the wall itself for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side deals no damage.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

# Wall of Flesh

*6th-level (evocation; chaos, evil, protection)*

**Area:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (piece of bone)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
A squirming wall of body parts noisily heaves itself up from the ground at a point you choose. The wall is 6 inches thick and is made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. The wall can have any shape you desire.  
If the wall enters a creature’s space when it appears, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, and on a success it moves up to its Speed to escape. On a failed save, it is swallowed by the wall (as below).  
When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn within 10 feet of the wall, tentacles and arms reach out to grab it. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and becomes grappled. If the creature was already grappled by the wall at the start of its turn and fails its saving throw, a mouth opens in the wall and swallows the creature.  
A creature swallowed by the wall takes 5d8 ongoing bludgeoning damage and is blinded, deafened, and restrained.  
A creature grappled or restrained by the wall can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, a grappled creature frees itself and a restrained creature claws its way out of the wall’s space, exiting to an empty space next to the wall and still grappled.  
Cast at Higher Levels. The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above the 6th.

**Rare: Eager Wall of Flesh.** The wall’s reach increases and it can target creatures within 15 feet of it. In addition, when a creature fails its saving throw against the wall by 5 or more the wall swallows the creature.

# Wall of Force

*5th-level (evocation; arcane, force, planar,*  
*protection, utility)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (powder of crushed  
clear gemstone)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You create an invisible wall of force at a point you choose. The wall is a horizontal or vertical barrier, or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. The wall is 1/4 inch thick.  
If the wall enters a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move up to its Speed to escape. Any creature without a special sense like blindsight has disadvantage on this saving throw.  
Nothing can physically pass through the wall.It can be destroyed with *dispel magic* cast using a spell slot of at least 5th-level or by being dealt at least 25 force damage in one round by a single attack or from a single effect. It is otherwise immune to damage. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through it.

**Rare: Superior Forcewall.** Creatures pushed to one side of the wall are knocked prone. The wall can be destroyed with *dispel magic* cast using a spell slot of at least 6th-level or by being dealt at least 50 force damage in one round by a single attack or from a single effect.

# Wall of Ice

*6th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, cold, protection)*  
**Classes:** Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (quartz)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You create a wall of ice on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. The wall is 1 foot thick.  
If the wall enters a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of it (your choice). In addition, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.  
The wall is an object with vulnerability to fire damage, AC 12, and 30 hit points per 10-foot section. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the section occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

**Rare: Glacial Wall.** The wall is not vulnerable to fire damage. Each section has AC 15 and 35 hit points.

# Wall of Stone

*5th-level (evocation; arcane, divine, earth, obscurement, protection, terrain, utility)*  
**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (granite cube)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You cause a nonmagical wall of solid stone to appear at a point you choose. The wall is 6 inches thick and is made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot sections that are only 3 inches thick.  
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation but must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.  
If the wall enters a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move up to its Speed to escape.  
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenelations, battlements, and so on.  
The wall is an object, and each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and at the Narrator’s discretion might cause connected panels to collapse.  
You can make the wall permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration.

**Rare: Hardy Wall of Stone.** Each panel has AC 18 and 40 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it but does not cause connected panels to collapse.

# Wall of Thorns

**Area:** Special  
**Components:** V, S, M (a length of bramble vine)  
**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)  
You create a wall of thorny vines and brush that blocks line of sight on a solid surface. You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.   
When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.  
A creature can move through the wall, but at a cost. It must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves through the wall. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 7d8 slashing damage, or half as much on a successful save.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** Damage dealt by the wall increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

# Warding Bond

**Classes:** Cleric

**Target:** One creature  
**Components:** V, S, M (pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gold each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
Until the spell ends, the target is warded by a mystic connection between it and you. The target gains a \+1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage while within 60 feet of you. Each time it takes damage, you take an equal amount of damage.  
The spell ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if you use an action to dismiss it, or if the spell is cast again on either you or the target.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.

# Warrior’s Instincts

*5th-level (divination; enhancement, protection, senses)*  
**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (headband)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
Your senses sharpen. Until the spell ends, creatures cannot gain bonuses (like those granted by *bless* or expertise dice) or advantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, none of your movement provokes opportunity attacks, and you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain. Finally, you can end the spell early to treat a single weapon attack roll as though you had rolled a 15 on the d20.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** For each slot level above 5th, you can also apply this spell’s benefits to an additional creature you can see within 30 feet.

# Water Breathing

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Up to ten willing creatures you can see  
**Components:** V, S, M (short reed or piece of straw)  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
Until the spell ends, the targets are able to breathe underwater (and still able to respirate normally).

# Water Walk

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** Up to ten willing creatures you can see  
**Components**: V, S, M (piece of cork)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
Until the spell ends, the targets are able to move across any liquid surface (such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava) as if it were solid ground. Creatures can still take damage from surfaces that would deliver damage from corrosion or extreme temperatures, but they do not sink while moving across it.  
A target submerged in a liquid is moved to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

# Web

*2nd-level (conjuration; arcane, movement, obscurement)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Area:** 20-foot cube  
**Components:** V, S, M (spiderweb)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)  
**Saving Throw:** Dexterity negates  
Thick, sticky webs fill the area, lightly obscuring it and making it difficult terrain.  
You must anchor the webs between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layer them across a flat surface. If you don’t, the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell ends. Webs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.  
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained as long as it remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).  
A creature restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.  
Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 4th-level spell slot, you also summon a **giant wolf spider** in an unoccupied space within the web’s area. When using a 6th-level spell slot, you summon up to two spiders. When using a 7th-level spell slot, you summon up to three spiders. The spiders are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spiders as a group, which have their own turns. The spiders obey your verbal commands, but they disappear when the spell ends or when they leave the web’s area.

**Rare: Potent Web.** Checks made by restrained creatures to escape the web have disadvantage.  
**Rare: Flammable Web.** Any 10-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away instantly, dealing 3d4 fire damage to any creature in the area.

# Weird

*9th-level (illusion; arcane, attack, fear)*  
Classes: Wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Long (120 feet)  
**Area:** 30-foot sphere  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You plague creatures with nighmares. Each creature in the area makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened until the spell ends. At the end of each of a frightened creature’s turns, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

# Whirlwind Kick

*3rd-level (transmutation; movement, thunder, unarmed)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Area:** Line up to 60 feet long and 15 feet wide  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You must be able to move in order to cast this spell. You leap into the air, striking foes all around you with supernatural force as you fly up to 60 feet in a straight line. Your movement (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity) must end on a surface that can support your weight or you fall as normal.  
As part of the casting of this spell, make a melee spell attack against any number of creatures in the area. On a hit, you deal your unarmed strike damage plus 2d6 thunder damage. In addition, creatures in the area make a Dexterity saving throw or are either pulled 10 feet closer to you or pushed 10 feet away (your choice).  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The extra thunder damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

# Wind Up

*1st-level (evocation; enhancement)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, herald, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components**: S

# Wind Walk

*6th-level (transmutation; air, divine, movement,*  
*transformation)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Short (30 feet)  
**Target:** You and up to 10 willing creatures you can see  
Components: V, S, M (an animal bladder)  
**Duration:** 8 hours  
The targets assume a gaseous form and appear as wisps of cloud. Each target has a flying speed of 300 feet and resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons, but the only actions it can take the Dash action or to revert to its normal form (a process that takes 1 minute during which it is incapacitated and can’t move).  
Until the spell ends, a target can change again to cloud form (in an identical transformation process).  
When the effect ends for a target flying in cloud form, it descends 60 feet each round for up to 1 minute or until it safely lands. If the target can’t land after 1 minute, it falls the rest of the way normally.

# Wind Wall

*3rd-level (evocation; air, attack, divine, protection, weather)*  
**Classes:** Druid  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range**: Long (120 feet)  
**Area**: Special  
**Components**: V, S, M (an ivory flute)  
**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)  
You create a wall of strong wind at a point you choose. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground.  
When the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
The wall keeps fog, smoke, and other gasses (including creatures in gaseous form) at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the area fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss (larger projectiles such as boulders and ballista bolts are unaffected).  
**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

# Wish

*9th-level (conjuration; arcane)*  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
You alter reality itself.  
The safest use of this spell is the duplication of any other spell of 8th-level or lower without needing to meet its requirements (including components).  
You may instead choose one of the following:

* One nonmagical object of your choice that is worth up to 25,000 gold and no more than 300 feet in any dimension appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.  
* Up to 20 creatures that you can see to regain all their hit points, and each is further healed as per the *greater restoration* spell.  
* Up to 10 creatures that you can see gain resistance to a damage type you choose.  
* Up to 10 creatures you can see gain immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.  
* You force a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). At your discretion, the roll is made with advantage or disadvantage. You can choose to take either the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the Narrator as precisely as possible, being very careful in your wording. Be aware that the greater the *wish*, the greater the chance for an unexpected result. This spell might simply fizzle, your desired outcome might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the *wish*. The Narrator has the final authority in ruling what occurs—and reality is not tampered with lightly.  
*Multiple Wishes:* The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. Until finishing a long rest, each time you cast a spell you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented. In addition, your Strength drops to 3 for 2d4 days (if it isn’t 3 or lower already). For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33% chance that you are unable to cast *wish* ever again.

# Word of Recall

*6th-level (conjuration; divine, teleportation)*  
**Classes:** Cleric  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 5 feet  
**Target:** You and up to 5 willing creatures  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
The targets instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary.  
Before using the spell in this way, you must first designate a sanctuary by it within a location aligned with your faith, such as a temple of your deity

**Rare: Expeditious Word of Recall.** Targets instantly teleport to the last location aligned with your faith that you physically entered but have not designated as a sanctuary. Attempts to cast this spell again before 7 days have passed automatically fail.

# Wormway

*6th-level (enchantment; movement, summoning)*  
**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute (ritual)  
**Range:** Special (150 miles)  
**Target:** You and up to 50 willing creatures of Large size or smaller  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
When you cast this spell, the nearest **purple worm** within range is charmed by you and begins moving toward a point on the ground that you can see. If there are no purple worms within range, the spell fails. The earth rumbles slightly as it approaches and breaks through the surface. Any creatures within 20 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from it.  
Upon emerging, the purple worm lays down before you and opens its maw. Targets can climb inside where they are enclosed in an impervious hemispherical dome of force.  
Once targets are loaded into the purple worm, nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though targets in the sphere can breathe there. The hemisphere is immune to all damage, and creatures and objects inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a target inside the hemisphere damage anything outside it. The atmosphere inside the dome is comfortable and dry regardless of conditions outside it.  
The purple worm waits until you give it a mental command to depart, at which point it dives back into the ground and travels, without need for rest or food, as directly as possible while avoiding obstacles to a destination known to you. It travels 150 miles per day.  
When the purple worm reaches its destination it surfaces, the dome vanishes, and it disgorges the targets in its mouth before diving back into the depths again.  
The purple worm remains charmed by you until it has delivered you to your destination and returned to the depths, or until it is attacked at which point the charm ends, it vomits its targets in the nearest unoccupied space as soon as possible, and then retreats to safety.

**Rare: Surfacing Wormway.** When this spell ends early because the purple worm is attacked, it travels to the surface to spit the targets out and then retreats to safety.

# Writhing Transformation

*9th-level (transmutation; arcane, evil, transformation)*  
**Classes:** Warlock, wizard  
**Casting Time:** 1 week (ritual)  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (coffin filled with worms, consumed by the spell)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
As part of the casting of this spell, you lay down in the coffin on a patch of bare earth and it buries itself. Over the following week, you are incapacitated and do not need air, food, or sleep. Your insides are eaten by worms, but you do not die and your skin remains intact. If you are exhumed during this time, or if the spell is otherwise interrupted, you die.  
At the end of the week, the transformation is complete and your true form is permanently changed. Your appearance is unchanged but underneath your skin is a sentient mass of worms. Any creature that makes a Medicine check against your spell save DC realizes that there is something moving underneath your skin.  
Your statistics change in the following ways:

* Your type changes to aberration, and you do not age or require sleep.  
* You cannot be healed by normal means, but you can spend an action or bonus action to consume 2d6 live worms, regaining an equal amount of hit points by adding them to your body.  
* You can sense and telepathically control all worms that have the beast type and are within 60 feet of you.

In addition, you are able to discard your shell of skin and travel as a writhing mass of worms. As an action, you can abandon your skin and pour out onto the ground. In this form you have the statistics of a **swarm of insects** with the following exceptions: you keep your hit points, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma scores, and proficiencies. You know but cannot cast spells in this form. You also gain a burrow speed of 10 feet. Any worms touching you instantly join with your swarm, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to the number of worms that join with your form (maximum 40 temporary hit points). These temporary hit points last until you are no longer in this form.  
If you spend an hour in the same space as a dead creature of your original form’s size, you can eat its insides and inhabit its skin in the same way you once inhabited your own. While you are in your swarm form, the most recent skin you inhabited remains intact and you can move back into a previously inhabited skin in 1 minute. You have advantage on checks made to impersonate a creature while wearing its skin.

# Zone of Truth

*2nd-level (enchantment; communication, compulsion, law)*  
**Classes:** Bard, cleric, herald  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Medium (60 feet)  
**Area:** 15-foot sphere  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
You create a zone that minimizes deception. Any creature that is able to be charmed can’t deliberately lie while in the area.  
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can choose not to speak, or it might be evasive in its communications. A creature that enters the zone for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d4 psychic damage when it intentionally tries to mislead or occlude important information. Each time the spell damages a creature, it makes a Deception check (DC 8 \+ the damage dealt) or its suffering is obvious. You know whether a creature succeeds on its saving throw.
