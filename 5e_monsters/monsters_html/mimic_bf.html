<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adhesive (Object Form Only):</strong> The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 13). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance (Object Form Only):</strong> While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.</li>
<li><strong>Grappler:</strong> The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it.</li>
<li><strong>Monstrosity Resilience:</strong> The mimic is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The mimic makes two Pseudopod attacks. If it is grappling a creature, it can replace one attack with a Bite attack.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled creature. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudopod:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage. If the mimic is in object form, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Shape:</strong> The mimic transforms into a Large or smaller object or back into its true, amorphous form, which is a Monstrosity. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prey Shield:</strong> When a creature the mimic can see hits it with an attack while it is grappling a creature, the mimic can roll the grappled creature in front of the blow, forcing the grappled creature to take the damage instead.</li>
</ul>
