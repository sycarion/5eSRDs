<li><strong>Angelic Senses:</strong> The planetar can pinpoint the location of Aberrations, Celestials, Fiends, and Undead within 30 feet of it and knows if a place or object it can sense is consecrated or desecrated.</li>
<li><strong>Angelic Weapons:</strong> The planetar's weapon attacks are magical. When it hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 7d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).</li>

</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The planetar makes two Greatsword attacks, or it makes three Radiant Bolt attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting. If two Greatsword or Radiant Bolt attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 19 CON save or be blinded until the end of its next turn.</li>

<li><strong>Radiant Burst (Recharge 6):</strong> A pulse of divine power ripples out from the planetar's golden halo. Each hostile creature within 15 feet of the planetar must make a DC 19 DEX save, taking 56 (16d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each friendly creature within 15 feet of the planetar is empowered with divine energy and has advantage on all melee attack rolls it makes before the start of the planetar's next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Healing Touch (4/Day):</strong> The planetar touches another creature. The target magically regains 30 (6d8+3) HP and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The planetar casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using CHA as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 19).<br>At will: <em>command</em>, <em>invisibility</em> (self only)<br>3/day each: <em>daylight</em>, <em>raise dead</em> (as an action)</li>
