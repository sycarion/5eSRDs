<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ice Wall:</strong> The ice devil causes a wall of ice to magically rise from the ground at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. It can be any shape, as long as its base is connected to the ground. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side (the devil's choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall, it can make a DC 17 DEX save. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.<br>The wall lasts 1 minute, until the devil creates a new wall, or until the devil dies. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 HP, is vulnerable to fire damage, and is immune to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ice Shield:</strong> When the ice devil or a friendly creature it can see is hit by an attack, the devil can create a magical barrier of ice to disrupt the attack. The target halves the damage from the attack.</li>
