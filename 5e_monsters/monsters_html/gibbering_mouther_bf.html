<ul>
<li><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> prone</li>
<li><strong>Damage Resistances:</strong> Aberrant Resilience</li>
<li><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 60 ft.</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> -</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aberrant Ground:</strong> The ground within 10 feet of the mouther is dough-like difficult terrain. A creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Aberrant Resilience:</strong> The mouther is resistant to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions, and it has advantage on saves against spells or effects that would alter its form.</li>
<li><strong>Gibbering:</strong> The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't incapacitated. A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther and that can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and must roll a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and moves its full speed in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The gibbering mouther makes two Bite attacks. If both attacks hit one Medium or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d8+2) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Rend Mind:</strong> One creature the mouther can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and suffer a random, short-term dread effect for 1 minute</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blinding Spittle:</strong> The mouther spits an otherworldly goo at up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or be blinded until the end of its next turn.</li>
