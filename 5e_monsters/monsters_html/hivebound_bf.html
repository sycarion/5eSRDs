<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collective Mind:</strong> The hivebound's individual insects and swarms under its control are connected via a hive mind. It can telepathically communicate with any of its individual insects and swarms within 1 mile of it, and it can't be surprised. It can have up to five swarms of insects under its control at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Monstrosity Resilience:</strong> The hivebound is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforced Mind:</strong> If the hivebound starts its turn afflicted by an ongoing effect that allows a repeated INT, WIS, or CHA save to end the effect, such as the hold spell, the hivebound can make the save at the start of the turn instead of the end and has advantage on the save.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The hivebound makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes three Spit Insect attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d8+3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Spit Insect:</strong> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or be pestered until the end of its next turn. A pestered creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the pester ends.</li>
<li><strong>Swarm Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The hivebound exhales stinging insects in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 10 (4d4) piercing damage and 17 (5d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A swarm of insects under the hivebound's control then forms in an unoccupied space in that area.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swift Flight:</strong> The hivebound flies up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
</ul>
