<li><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 30 ft.</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> any one language (usually Common)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood-Bound:</strong> If the thrall has not consumed 1 ounce of blood from a vampire within the past week, it is poisoned for 1 week, and it loses darkvision and its Limited Regeneration, Spider Climb, and Sunlight Sensitivity traits until it consumes 1 ounce of vampire blood.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Regeneration:</strong> The thrall regains 2 HP at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 HP and isn't in sunlight. If the thrall takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the thrall's next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The thrall can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the thrall has disadvantage on attack rolls, and its Perception is 8 when perceiving by sight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The vampire thrall makes two Rapier attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Rapier:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repay the Gift:</strong> When a friendly vampire the thrall can see within 5 feet of it is hit by an attack that would reduce the vampire to 0 HP, the thrall can give some of its life force to save the vampire. The thrall loses 10 (3d6) HP, and the vampire regains HP equal to that amount.</li>
</ul>
