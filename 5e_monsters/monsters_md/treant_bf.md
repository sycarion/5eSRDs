- **Speak with Plants:** The treant can communicate with Plants and nonmagical plants as if they shared a language.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The treant makes three Slam attacks, or it makes two Throw Rock attacks. If two Slam attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or be knocked prone.

- **Throw Rock:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 33 (5d10+6) bludgeoning damage.
- **Animate Trees (1/Day):** The treant magically animates 2 trees or 2d6 shrubs it can see within 60 feet of it. The trees use the statistics of an **awakened tree**, and the shrubs use the statistics of an **awakened shrub**. The animated plants act as allies of the treant, obeying its spoken commands. The plants remain for 1 hour, until the treant dies, or until the treant dismisses them as a bonus action.

### Bonus Actions

- **Halt Intruders:** The treant calls to the roots beneath up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 17 STR save or be restrained by roots until the end of its next turn. The treant can target only creatures in contact with the ground and can't target creatures in contact with a manufactured floor, such as the wooden floor of a building.
