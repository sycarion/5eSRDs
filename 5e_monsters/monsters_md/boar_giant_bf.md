### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a Tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the boar takes 10 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 HP, it is reduced to 1 HP instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant boar makes two Tusk attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Tusk:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Challenging Snort:** The boar snorts and stomps its feet at a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn and have disadvantage on the next save it makes against being knocked prone by the boar.
