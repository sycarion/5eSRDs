### Special Abilities

- **Giant Attributes:** The ogre is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ogre makes two Greatclub or Javelin attacks.
- **Greatclub:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Javelin:** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage.
- **Bowling Sweep (Recharge 5-6):** The ogre sweeps its weapon in a wide arc around it. Each creature within 10 feet of the ogre must make a DC 14 STR save. Small and smaller creatures have disadvantage on the save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 10 feet away from the ogre, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shoving Rush:** The ogre takes the Dash action. If it moves, it can propel itself into one creature it can see along its path. The target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from a target that fails this save.
