## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of (A) Spellcasting to cast *Guiding Bolt* (level 2 version) or (B) Weakening Breath.

***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +14, reach 10 ft. 17 (2d8 + 8) Slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) Fire damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw*: DC 21, each creature in a 60-foot Cone. *Failure:*  66 (12d10) Fire damage. *Success:*  Half damage.

***Weakening Breath.*** *Strength Saving Throw*: DC 21, each creature that isn't currently affected by this breath in a 60-foot Cone. *Failure:*  The target has Disadvantage on Strength-based D20 Test and subtracts 3 (1d6) from its damage rolls. It repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.

***Guiding Light.*** The dragon uses Spellcasting to cast *Guiding Bolt* (level 2 version).

***Pounce.*** The dragon moves up to half its Speed, and it makes one Rend attack.
