### Special Abilities

- **Poisonous Swarm:** The hissing, spitting, and constant nipping of snakes in the swarm leaves the swarm's space dripping with poison. A creature that starts its turn in the swarm's space must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny snake. The swarm can't regain HP or gain temporary HP.
- **Swarm Resilience:** The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is immune to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions.

### Actions

- **Bites:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. _Hit:_ 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its HP or fewer. The target must make a DC 14 CON save, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
