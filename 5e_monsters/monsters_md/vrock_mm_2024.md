## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vrock makes two Shred attacks.

***Shred.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft. 10 (2d6 + 3) Piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Poison damage.

***Spores (Recharge 6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot Emanation originating from the vrock. *Failure:*  The target has the Poisoned condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
