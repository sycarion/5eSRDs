### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The crab can breathe air and water.

### Actions

- **Pincer:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). The crab has two pincers, each of which can grapple only one target.

### Bonus Actions
