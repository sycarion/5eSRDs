### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The centaur is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Trampling Charge:** If the centaur moves at least 30 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Pike attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the centaur can make one Hooves attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The centaur makes one Hooves attack and one Pike attack, or it makes three Longbow attacks.
- **Hooves:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6+4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Pike:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (1d10+4) piercing damage.

### Reactions

- **Defensive Kick:** When a creature the centaur can see within 5 feet of it hits it with an attack, the centaur can kick the attacker. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone or pushed up to 5 feet away from the centaur (the centaur's choice).
