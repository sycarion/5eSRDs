### Special Abilities

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, and its Perception is 7 when perceiving by sight.
- **Undead Nature:** The wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Undead Resilience:** The wraith is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The wraith makes two Life Drain attacks.
- **Life Drain:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 18 (4d6+4) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or its HP maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0.
- **Create Specter:** The wraith targets one Humanoid it can see within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a **specter** in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The **specter** is under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.

### Bonus Actions

- **Trail of Death (Recharge 4-6):** The wraith moves up to 30 feet in a straight line. This distance is not reduced by moving through creatures or objects, and this movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or be afflicted with wasting doom. While afflicted with wasting doom, a creature takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Wasting doom ends if a creature starts its turn in sunlight or regains HP.

### Reactions

- **Unravel Life:** When a creature the wraith can see within 30 feet of it and that isn't a Construct or Undead regains HP, the wraith can corrupt the healing energies, halving the amount of healing that creature receives.
