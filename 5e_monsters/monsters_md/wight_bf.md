The target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or its HP maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0.<br>A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time.

### Bonus Actions

- **Command Horde:** The wight commands up to five friendly skeletons or zombies to do one of the following:<br>- **Protect.** Until the start of the wight's next turn, each time a friendly creature within 5 feet of a target is attacked, the target can use its reaction to intercept the attack, becoming the target instead.<br>- **Overwhelm.** Until the start of the wight's next turn, each target has advantage on attack rolls against a creature on its turn if at least one other target is within 5 feet of the creature and the allied target isn't incapacitated.<br>- **Shamble.** Each target uses its reaction to move up to its speed in a direction chosen by the wight. If this movement provokes an opportunity attack, that attack is made with disadvantage.
