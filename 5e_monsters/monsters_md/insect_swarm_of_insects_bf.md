### Special Abilities

- **Crawling Swarm:** A creature in the swarm's space is covered in crawling and buzzing insects. If the creature casts a spell with a somatic component, it must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or the spell fails to cast, expending the action required to cast it but not the spell slot or daily use.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain HP or gain temporary HP.
- **Swarm Resilience:** The swarm is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it is immune to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, and stunned conditions.

### Actions
