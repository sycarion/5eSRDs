# Lazy GM Tools

This repository contains several game master tools for tabletop roleplaying games, particularly for, but not exclusively for, 5e games.

In this repository you'll find:

**The 5e Artisanal Database (/5e_artisanal_database/)**. A collection of rules, datasources, tools, and generators for 5e RPGs. Data mostly comes from [Open5e](https://open5e.com). All the material is in HTML, markdown, and javascript. This toolset can be hosted on a private webserver or run locally on your desktop in a web browser.

**The Dyson Map Selector (/dyson_maps/)**. A tool to find maps from a library of commercially-licensed [Dyson Logos](https://dysonlogos.blog) maps. Please consider joining [Dyson's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dysonlogos/).

**The Forge of Foes Stat Tool (fof_stats.html)** (now bundled in the 5e Artisanal Database). A single-page HTML file to help you generate 5e statistics for 5e monsters using the material found in *[Forge of Foes](https://shop.slyflourish.com/collections/the-lazy-dungeon-master-series/products/forge-of-foes)*.

**The 5e Artisanal Monster Database (/5e_monsters/) (replaced by the 5e Artisanal Database)**. A monster database built from [Open5e](https://open5e.com) in HTML and markdown, all set up to run locally through your own browser.

**The Lazy GM's Random Generator (lazy_gm_generator_perchance_input.txt) (replaced by the 5e Artisanal Database)**. A Perchance input for building a random generator in HTML. You can use the input yourself in Perchance or use the HTML version directly.

**RPG Tips**. A CSV of all the #dnd tips I posted to Twitter from 2009 to 2020 and a set of RPG tips from about 2015 to present. Released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

**Obsidian Lazy DM Campaign Template**. A simple set of markdown files and directories to build Lazy DM-style notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

**Forge of Foes Stats for Espanso (forge_of_foes_for_espanso.yml)**. A set of YAML instructions compatible with [espanso](https://espanso.org/).

**Dice Roller App** (now bundled in the 5e Artisanal Database). Inspired by the dice roller WOTC used to host on their site but threw away along with everything else on their website; this dice roller is self-hostable, executable in any browser, hostable on any website, and released under a CC0 license so you're free to do whatever you want with it without asking permission.

**wotc_5-1_srd_cc.md** (now bundled in the 5e Artisanal Database). The original WOTC 5.1 SRD containing all the rules for D&D 5th Edition released in the Creative Commons. This is formatted in Markdown so you can use it directly in Obsidian.

**A5e SRD Markdown** (now bundled in the 5e Artisanal Database). A Markdown conversion of the [Level Up Advanced 5e System Reference Document](https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd) so you can drop it right into Obsidian.

**black_flag_monsters.md** (now bundled in the 5e Artisanal Database). All of the Kobold Press Black Flag monsters in a single markdown file so you can drop it right into Obisidian.

All of these fine tools are made possible by the generous support of the [Sly Flourish Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/slyflourish). If you are not a patron, please consider joining!

Licenses are described in each of the tools.
