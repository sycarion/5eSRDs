# Multiclassing

Whenever you gain a character level, you can choose to gain a level in a different class instead of gaining the next level in your current class. Your character level is the total number of levels you have in any classes.  
Multiclassing allows you to freely develop your adventurer in whatever direction you see fit. Compared to an adventurer of a single class, you’ll have a wider range of options, but you will reach more powerful class features later than most.

# Experience Points

If your game is utilizing experience points (XP), your XP cost to gain new class levels is based on your character level and not your level in any class. 

# Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain a class’s hit points described for 1st level only from your very first level as a 1st level character. Any levels gained from multiclassing gain the hit points as described for levels after 1st level, even if they would be the first level gained in a particular class.  
If your classes both provide the same hit die type, you can simply pool them together. If your classes provide different hit die types, you must keep track of them separately and you may spend them as you choose for any features that require hit dice.

# Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is based on your character level, not on any one class. 

# Proficiencies

You only gain some of the 1st level proficiencies from classes taken after your first class, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

**TABLE: MULTICLASSING PROFICIENCIES**

| CLASS | PROFICIENCIES GAINED |
| :---- | :---- |
| Adept | Simple weapons, shortswords |

# Starting Equipment

You only gain the starting equipment of your first class at 1st level. You do not gain any additional starting equipment from your first levels in additional classes.

# Class Features

Whenever you gain a new level in a class, you gain the class features for that level. Some features are found in multiple classes and need additional rules when combined: **Alternate Armor Class**, **Combat Maneuvers**, **Extra Attack**, and **Spellcasting**.

# Alternate Armor Class

Multiple instances of any feature that provides an alternate Armor Class calculation do not stack and cannot combine in any way. If you have multiple features that provide an alternate Armor Class calculation, your AC is equal to the highest Armor Class calculation that currently applies.

# Combat Maneuvers

If you gain the Combat Maneuvers class feature from more than one class, you gain any additional combat traditions or maneuvers the features provide but your exertion pool remains the same and does not stack.  
***Heralds.*** The herald is an exception to this rule. If your first levels are in the herald class, you gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You regain exertion spent from this pool at the end of a rest.

You use your class levels in every class that grants combat maneuvers to determine the highest degree of combat maneuvers you can learn, determined by the class with the greatest access. 

# Extra Attack

You cannot stack multiple instances of the Extra Attack feature from multiple classes, and additional instances of the feature do not add additional attacks.  
***Fighters and Marshals.*** The additional 11th level Extra attack feature gained by fighters and marshals are both exceptions to this rule (a fighter 5/marshal 6 can attack 3 times with the Attack action.)

# Spellcasting

If you gain the Spellcasting feature from only one class you follow the spellcasting rules found in that class. However, if you gain the Spellcasting feature from different classes you must use the following rules.

## Spells Known and Prepared

You know and prepare the spells of each of your classes as if you only had levels in that class. Each spell you know and prepare uses the Spellcasting feature of the associated class, including spellcasting ability and any spellcasting focus.

Your total number of spell slots is determined by adding together all the class levels you have from classes with the Spellcasting feature, but some classes do not count as highly as others when determining your spell slots.  
Your class levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes all count fully towards your spell slots.  
Half your levels in the herald class count towards your spell slots.  
One third of your levels in the ranger class with the Wildborn archetype count towards your spell slots.  
Use this total to determine your spell slots using the Multiclass Spellcaster table.  
This table may provide you with spell slots at levels higher than you can prepare or know. While you cannot use these slots for spells you don’t know or can’t prepare, you can still use them to enhance many lower level spells.

## Pact Magic

If you have a Spellcasting class feature and the warlock’s Pact Magic class feature, you may spend spell points gained from your Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know from your Spellcasting class feature. Similarly, you can use spell slots gained from your Spellcasting feature to cast warlock spells you know.

# 

# Feats

A feat grants an adventurer special abilities beyond their class features.  
Whenever your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can instead choose a feat. Unless otherwise noted, you can take each feat only once.  
In order to take a feat or gain its benefits, you must meet its prerequisites (if any). 

# Magical Feats

If you are a warlock and select a feat that allows you to choose your spellcasting ability (such as taking Power Caster and choosing a warlock cantrip), you must use the spellcasting ability chosen when you became a warlock. When taking multiple feats that allow you to choose your spellcasting ability and selecting options to cast warlock spells, you must use the spellcasting ability chosen when you took the first of these feats.

### Divine Orator

*Prerequisites: Proclaimer feat*  
You learn the Divine Inspiration and Persuasive Speech battle hymns. These special battle hymns can only be performed while you are using your voice Art Specialty as a spell focus.  
**Divine Inspiration.** When an ally within 15 feet hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, your ally can deliver a Divine Smite just as if you had delivered it yourself using your Divine Smite feature (expending one of your uses). If you are able to empower your smites, you may choose to empower it as normal.  
**Persuasive Speech.** Hostile creatures within 60 feet take a –1d4 penalty on attack rolls. You can sustain this battle hymn for up to 3 rounds without expending additional uses of Bardic Inspiration. When a hostile creature begins its third consecutive turn within range of this battle hymn it becomes charmed by you and will not attack you or your allies. If this causes combat to end early, the creatures remain charmed by you for up to 1 minute afterward or until one of them is damaged by you or an ally. For the next 24 hours after the battle hymn ends, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks made against creatures that were charmed in this way. A creature that either shares your alignment or worships a deity that has your alignment becomes charmed on its second consecutive turn instead. Creatures that have an opposite alignment or worship a greater entity that has an opposite alignment cannot be charmed in this way.

#### Harbinger of Things to Come

*Prerequisite: Divine Orator feat*  
You learn the Preach Despair and Preach Hope battle hymns. These special battle hymns can only be performed while you are using your voice Art Specialty as a spell focus.

Creatures with an opposite alignment from yours or that worship a greater entity that has an opposite alignment suffer two levels of strife instead. A creature cannot suffer more than two levels of strife from Preach Despair in the same 24 hours.  
**Preach Hope.** Creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain advantage on saving throws. When the battle hymn ends, allies within 30 feet of you remove one level of strife. An ally that shares your alignment or worships a greater entity removes two levels of strife instead.

## Primordial Caster

*Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell*  
Upon gaining this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

* When you cast a spell that deals damage, your spell’s damage ignores damage resistance to the chosen type.  
* When you cast a spell that deals damage of the chosen type, you deal 1 additional damage for every damage die with a result of 1\.

This feat can be selected multiple times, choosing a different damage type each time.

## Rallying Speaker

*Prerequisite: Charisma 13 or higher*  
When you spend 10 minutes speaking inspirationally, you can choose up to 6 friendly creatures (including yourself) within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level \+ your Charisma modifier. A creature can’t gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a rest.

## Resonant Bond

You’re able to form a greater bond with magic items. During a short rest, you can focus on a non-consumable magic item and create a unique bond with it called resonance. You can have resonance with only one item at a time. Attempting to resonate with another item fails until you end the resonance with your current item. When you resonate with an item, you gain the following benefits.

* If the resonant item requires attunement and you meet the prerequisites to do so, you become attuned to the item. If you don’t meet the prerequisites, both the attunement and resonance with the item fails. This attunement doesn’t count toward the maximum number of items you can be attuned to. Unlike other attuned items, your attunement to this item doesn’t end from being more than 100 feet away from it for 24 hours.  
* Once per rest, as a bonus action, you can summon a resonant item, which appears instantly in your hand so long as it is located on the same plane of existence. You must have a free hand to use this feature and be able to hold the item.   
* If the resonant item is sentient, you have advantage on Charisma checks and saving throws made when resolving a conflict with the item.  
* If the resonant item is an artifact, you can ignore the effects of one minor detrimental property.

You lose resonance with an item if another creature attunes to it or gains resonance with it. You can also voluntarily end the resonance by focusing on the item during a short rest, or during a long rest if the item is not in your possession.

## Rite Master

*Prerequisite: Intelligence or Wisdom 13 or higher*  
You gain a ritual book containing spells that you can cast as rituals while holding it.  
Choose one of the following classes: bard, cleric, druid, herald, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. When you acquire this feat, you create a ritual book holding two 1st-level spells of your choice from that class’ spell list. These spells must have the ritual tag. The class you choose determines your spellcasting ability for these spells: Intelligence for wizard, Wisdom for cleric or druid, Charisma for bard, herald, or sorcerer, or your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for warlock.  
If you come across a written spell with the ritual tag (like on a *spell scroll* or in a wizard’s spellbook), you can add it to your ritual book if the spell is on the spell list for the class you chose and its level is no higher than half your level (rounded up). Copying the spell into your ritual book costs 50 gold and 2 hours per level of the spell.

On a failed save, a creature becomes confused, except instead of rolling to determine their actions as normal for the confused condition, they are always considered to have rolled the 7 or 8 result. At the end of each of a confused creature’s turns it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to it for the remainder of your rage.

In addition, you also gain the Fearsome Pursuit and Burning Hatred features.  
**Fearsome Pursuit.** You can spend 1 minute focusing on a creature that is part of your vendetta. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, you learn that. Otherwise, after focusing, you know the distance and direction to that creature, and so long as you’re moving in pursuit of that creature, you and anyone traveling with you ignore difficult terrain. This effect ends if you take damage or end your turn without moving for any reason.  
**Burning Hatred.** You can use an action to target the focus of your Fearsome Pursuit if it is within 30 feet.
