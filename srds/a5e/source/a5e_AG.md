# Introduction

## The Core Rule

The twenty-sided die (d20) is at the heart of the action resolution mechanic. To make an attack, ability check, or saving throw, players roll a d20 and add their relevant modifiers. Apply any bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the appropriate difficulty rating (Armor Class, Difficulty Class, and so on). If the total equals or exceeds the rating, the roll is a success.

Otherwise, it�s a failure.

##### Group Checks

Sometimes the Narrator will call for a group check. Group checks take place when the entire party is engaged in a single task.

In a group check, every player makes an ability check as described above. If more than half of the group succeeds in their check, the group as a whole succeeds. If half or less of the group succeed, the group as a whole fails.

##### Criticals and Fumbles

When you roll a 20 on a d20 attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (before applying any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties), this is referred to as a �natural 20�. Rolling a 1 on a d20 attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (before applying any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties) is referred to as a �natural 1�.

**Critical Hits and Fumbles.** A natural 20 on an attack roll is a critical hit and is always

successful. On the flip side, rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll is considered a critical fumble and always misses.

**Critical Saves.** A natural 20 on a saving throw is a critical save and always succeeds. A natural 1 on a saving throw is always a failure. When you choose to fail a saving throw, your result is a natural 1.

**Critical Successes.** A natural 20 on an ability check is a critical success so long as the creature attempting it would normally have succeeded on the check. On a critical success the objective of the check is achieved and something else happens as well.

**Critical Failures.** A natural 1 on an ability check is a critical failure so long as the creature attempting it would normally have failed on the check. On a critical failure, the objective of the check is failed, and something unfortunate happens as well.

***Group Criticals.*** When making a group check, a critical success is achieved if all members of the party succeed in their checks, while a critical failure takes place if all members of the party fail.

Criticals and fumbles also provide opportunities for additional positive and negative consequences. At the Narrator�s discretion, a fumble might also result in a complication for the attacker.

## Advantage, Disadvantage, and Expertise

Some circumstances grant advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. To make a roll with advantage or disadvantage, roll two

twenty-sided dice instead of one. For

advantage, you use the higher of the two die rolls. For disadvantage, you use the lower of the two. When you have both advantage and disadvantage (regardless of from how many sources), they cancel each other out and you roll normally.

Some class features or traits grant you an expertise die for an attack roll or saving throw, or in a specific skill or tool proficiency. When you make a d20 roll with which you have gained an expertise die, roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the result of your check.

You can never roll more than one expertise die on the same roll. If another class feature or situation grants an expertise die of any size that applies to the same roll, you don�t gain another die; instead, the size of the largest expertise die increases by one step for that check, from 1d4 to 1d6, or 1d6 to 1d8. If you have a 1d8 expertise die on a check, further expertise dice have no effect.If you have advantage or disadvantage at the same time as an expertise die, only the d20 is rolled twice, not the expertise die.

While advantage is most commonly used to represent circumstantial factors affecting a situation, expertise dice typically represent the particular training a character takes into the adventure.

# Character Creation

## Determine Ability Scores

There are six key ability scores that factor into everything that your character does in the game: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These abilities and their uses are described in detail in later chapters.

Ability scores are generated randomly by rolling four 6-sided dice and recording the total of the highest three dice on a spare sheet of paper. You continue to do this until you have a total of six numbers.

Choose where you�d like to assign these numbers by recording each next to an ability score.

After that�s done, modify your ability scores to account for any additional bonuses your character gained from their background.

The final ability scores will determine your ability modifiers, which can be seen in the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.

To figure out your ability modifier without the table, subtract 10 from an ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Record the modifier next to your ability scores.

##### Variant: Standard Ability Array

Instead of rolling dice to determine your six ability scores, you may choose to use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

##### Variant: Ability Score Point Buy

With the Narrator�s approval, you can use the following method to create ability scores.

You have 27 points to spend on ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. This approach to ability score generation limits the highest score to 15 before the application of ability score increases from other sources.

**TABLE: ABILITY SCORE POINT COST**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **SCORE** | **COST** |
| 8 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 3 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 7 |
| 15 | 9 |

## Gear Up for Adventure

Your character begins the game with starting equipment determined by their background and class. Starting equipment includes everything from weapons and armor to general tools and items. Be sure to record your starting equipment on the character sheet.

If you�d like to have more flexibility in the gear your character starts the game with you can alternatively use your class� gold pieces (gp) to buy your own.

Be sure to keep in mind that your character has to carry everything you buy! Strength scores determine the maximum amount of equipment characters can carry. Avoid going over a total weight in pounds greater than your Strength score times 15, and be mindful of any bulky items that weigh over 40 pounds or are larger than 2 feet across.

If your character is going on a journey, they will also need to carry food and water with them (or whatever it is they eat and drink). You can carry a number of days� Supply equal to your Strength score, in addition to your equipment, weapons, and armor.

##### Defense

Your Armor Class (AC) represents your character�s ability to avoid sustaining damage in battle. Numerous things affect your AC in various ways, such as armor, traits, features, Dexterity and more.

Unarmored, your character�s AC is 10 + their Dexterity modifier. While wearing armor, utilizing shields, or taking advantage of traits and features, the AC calculation will differ based on the circumstances. For equipment the details of AC calculation are available as part of an item�s description, and the criteria and effects of other options are listed in your character�s class, heritage, or culture.

When your character is subject to more than one way to calculate their AC, you can choose which one to apply.

One of the key things to remember when making your character is that not everyone can use armor and shields. Your character must be proficient with armor and shields in order to use them with any efficiency, and there are certain drawbacks from struggling to use either without knowing how to properly do so.

##### Save Difficulty Classes

Some of your attacks and spells may force your target to make a saving throw to resist it. You have two saving throw difficulty classes (DCs), one used for combat maneuvers, and the other for spellcasting.

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier.

##### Offense

Weapons are the bread and butter of any savvy adventurer, even those who use them as only a last resort.

Weapon attacks are made by rolling a d20 and adding your proficiency bonus (as long as your character is actually proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier. Weapon damage is calculated by rolling the weapon�s damage die and adding any applicable modifiers.

Melee weapons use your character�s Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls.

Meanwhile, ranged weapons use Dexterity for attack and damage rolls. Some weapons with the thrown property, such as javelins, allow you to use your character�s Strength modifier instead.

All attacks also indicate the type of damage they deal. A sickle deals slashing damage while a heavy maul deals bludgeoning damage. Damage types, besides being cool aspects of your character, also come into play as some situations may call for one type of damage type over the other.

Some special attacks (basic combat maneuvers that you use to grapple or shove a creature) instead do an amount of damage called basic melee damage. This is equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.

## Beyond the First Steps

the activities of your character and their party members gains them experience points. As these accumulate a character will eventually gain a level when they�ve acquired a certain number of experience points as seen on Table: Character Advancement.

At tier 0 (levels 1st�2nd) your characters are novices. They are taking their very first steps towards destiny, perhaps traveling further from their homes than ever before. The obstacles and foes they face are only slightly more perilous than what commoners contend with, albeit more frequent.

When your character gains a level their class offers additional features, and at certain levels their proficiency bonus increases. Leveling up will eventually provide the opportunity to increase your ability scores; however no ability score can surpass 20.

As part of the process, each level provides your character with an additional Hit Die.

You may either roll this die or take the average result of the die (rounded up), add your Constitution modifier, and increase your hit point maximum by that amount.

## The World and You

The challenges your characters face and the adventures they take can be classified into five main tiers of play. Tiers of play help give you an idea of what to expect involving the scale of the challenges you face and how the world generally reacts to you.

At tier 0 (levels 1st�2nd) your characters are entirely new to adventuring, just beginning to learn how dangerous the world around them can really be.

At tier 1 (levels 3rd�4th) your characters are coming into their own as adventurers and learning the basic elements of their classes. Threats are small in scale and scope.

At tier 2 (levels 5th�10th) your characters are regional heroes. They are accessing new levels of martial or magical power and can use skills, features, and magic that attract attention and acclaim.

At tier 3 (levels 11th�16th) your characters are masters of their craft, well beyond the abilities of other people and even other adventurers. Spells can bend the definition of what�s possible while martial characters taking to the battlefield can and have turned the tides of massive battles.

At tier 4 (levels 17th�20th) your characters have reached a point where the challenges they face are of world-changing size and proportion. At this tier, your character�s actions have the potential to fundamentally alter the lives and wellbeing of those that rely on (or fear) them.

# Destinies

##### Inspiration

The Narrator awards inspiration, a resource which grants you an edge in important moments, when you roleplay your character according to your destiny. Each destiny has a source of inspiration which describes acts of roleplaying that should be rewarded with inspiration, although it remains at the Narrator�s discretion. Additionally, the Narrator can award inspiration whenever they feel a character has been particularly clever, engaging, or heartfelt in their roleplaying.

Once you have inspiration, you can save it indefinitely. Whenever you or an ally you can see makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you may spend your inspiration to grant advantage to that roll.

Alternatively, you can spend inspiration to use the inspiration feature unique to your chosen destiny.

You either have inspiration or you don�t; if you already have inspiration and do something worth rewarding inspiration, you do not gain a second use of inspiration.

##### Fulfilling Your Destiny

Each destiny includes a fulfillment feature that you gain when you achieve your destiny, a momentous event usually at the end of a major story arc in the narrative, indicated by the Narrator. Even if your destiny remains outside of your grasp, it is close enough at hand that you automatically gain its fulfillment feature when you reach 16th level.

If you fulfill your destiny early in a campaign, at the Narrator�s discretion you may select an additional destiny. You retain your original destiny�s features and gain the source of inspiration and inspiration feature of your new destiny. You cannot gain a second fulfillment feature.

*Prerequisite: Paralyzing Strike or Stunning Strike*

When you use Paralyzing Strike or Stunning Strike, you can spend an additional 2 exertion. If you do, your

target has disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the focus feature.

Purity of Body

*Prerequisite: 7th level*

You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be poisoned or diseased.

Share Focus

As an action, choose a creature. That creature can add your martial arts die to its next saving throw. You can�t use this feature again until you finish a rest.

Shockwave

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

You can use an action and spend 3 exertion to hit the ground so hard it creates a shockwave in a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn�t knocked prone.

Stillness of Mind

*Prerequisite: 7th level*

You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

Unlikely Wield

*Prerequisite: 11th level*

You can wield three weapons with the dual-wielding property at once. When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can use the third weapon to make an additional weapon attack.

Vengeful Spirit

*Prerequisite: 15th level*

When you make a death saving throw, you can choose to set your own spirit loose. The spirit acts on your initiative, uses your statistics, carries ethereal copies of your equipment, and has full hit points and half your exertion pool. Your vengeful spirit is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but it takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

The vengeful spirit targets only the creature that reduced you to 0 hit points. Once that creature is defeated, the spirit returns to your body. While the vengeful spirit is active, you don�t need to make death saving throws, but you still suffer failures if you are hit by an attack or take damage. You can�t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

Warding Dance

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

**TABLE: BATTLE HYMNS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **BARD LEVEL** | **BATTLE HYMN** |
| 1st�4th | **Harmony of Pain.** The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.  **Overbearing Rhythm.** Attacks against the target have disadvantage.  **Song of Clarity.** At the start of the target�s turn, if it is not at 0 hit points it can expend one of its Hit Dice to regain hit points. |

| 9th�12th | **Heaven�s Blessing.** When the target benefits from your Bardic Inspiration, it rolls the Bardic Inspiration die twice and uses the higher result.  **Ode of Blood.** If the target is dying, it continues making death saving throws but regains consciousness for up to 3 rounds.

Once a creature has benefited from this battle hymn, it can�t benefit from it again until it finishes a rest.  **Willful Serenade.** Until the end of the combat, the target ignores up to 4 levels of fatigue or strife it is suffering from (how much of each to ignore is determined by the creature). |

* **Ambassador�s Set (Cost 91 gp):** Longsword, shortbow with 20 arrows, padded leather, diplomat�s pack, violin

###### Art Speciality

Starting at 1st level, any musical instrument that you have proficiency with counts as a spell focus for the purposes of spellcasting. Although spells can be cast without these instruments, only targets that are able to perceive your performance can benefit from this feature. Whenever you finish a rest, choose one of the following as your Art Specialty.

**Percussion (Casabas, Castanets, Drums, Maracas).** Any instrument played by being struck or scraped (either by other

instruments or against each other) qualifies as a percussion instrument. When you cast a bard spell from the sound school using a percussion instrument as your spell focus, double the spell's range. A sound spell that has a range of Touch increases its range to 30 feet.

**String Instruments (Dulcimer, Harp, Lute, Lyre, Violin).** String instruments are played by plucking and twanging strings. When using a string instrument as a spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell from the movement or teleportation school, you can target an additional creature within 15 feet of you.

**Visual (Calligraphy, Dance, Light Manipulation, Shapes).** There are many ways to undertake a visual performance, whether through illustration, illusion magic, or legerdemain. When using visual art as a spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell, you can make one ally that can see you the point of origin of that spell.

You must be able to see any targets of the spell.

**Voice (Humming, Insults, Oration, Singing).** When using this musical art as a spell focus, you have advantage on checks made to maintain concentration on a bard spell.

**Wind Instruments (Bagpipes, Flute, Horn, Ocarina, Trombone).** Any instrument played by passing air through it qualifies as a wind instrument. When you cast a bard spell using a wind instrument as a spell focus, you can make a Deception or Performance check as a part of casting the spell. Creatures with a passive Insight score equal to or less than the result of your check do not see or hear you cast the spell. Once you have used this feature three times, you can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

###### Bardic Inspiration

A number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once) per long rest, you can use a bonus action to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet

that can hear or see you. That creature gains a d6 Bardic Inspiration die.

Within the next 10 minutes, before or after rolling an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw (but before the result is determined), the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the result. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is expended. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

At 5th level, your Bardic Inspiration die increases to a d8. At 10th level it increases to a d10, and at 15th level it increases to a d12.

###### Battle Hymn

At 1st level, you learn a battle hymn, which can be expressed in any type of performance. Once at the start of your turn, you can activate a battle hymn by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action is required).

Performing a battle hymn requires your concentration, as though you were casting a spell. Once activated, a battle hymn continues until you lose concentration or the start of your next turn.

The number of battle hymns you know are listed in the Battle Hymns Known column of the Bard table. Whenever you gain a bard level, you may choose one battle hymn you know and replace it with a new battle hymn. Your bard level determines what battle hymns you can learn.

**Audience.** Unless otherwise noted, a battle hymn does not have a target until you choose one, and each hymn targets a single creature within 30 feet. You can choose to target a creature at any time, but once you have chosen a target of your battle hymn, the hymn�s target can�t be changed.

**Sustained Song.** When you have an activated battle hymn but have not chosen a creature to benefit from it yet, at the start of your turn when it would end you can instead choose to sustain the battle hymn until the start of your next turn without expending a use of Bardic Inspiration.

##### Spellcasting

Cantrips

You learn two bard cantrips of your choice at 1st level and additional bard cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard Spells table.

Spell Slots

To cast a bard spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell�s level or higher. The Bard Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know your choice of four 1st-level spells from the bard spell list.

Consult the Spells Known column of the Bard Spells table to see when you can choose more bard spells. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a bard level, you can replace a bard spell you know with another from the bard spell list, provided it is of a level for which you have spell slots.

Ritual Casting

You can cast a bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell can be cast as a ritual.

Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier to set the attack bonus and saving throw DC for your bard spells, as follows:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus

When casting a bard spell, you can use an arcane focus or Art Speciality as your spellcasting focus.

###### Adventuring Tricks

At 2nd level, you learn one adventuring trick of your choice. Adventuring tricks are detailed at the end of the class description. The Tricks Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more adventuring tricks.

###### Jack-of-All-Trades

Starting at 2nd Level, if you are not proficient with a skill or tool, you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to ability checks using that skill or tool.

###### Varied Expertise

###### Bardic Legend

At 4th level, you write a bardic tale of your adventures. Your bardic legend takes whatever form you like. When you enter a settlement and spend a day playing or recounting the tale, the reputation of you and your allies starts to grow. In addition to receiving local quests suited to the exploits detailed in your bardic legend, when you rest in a settlement that knows your bardic

legend, you and your allies regain all spent hit dice over the course of a long rest. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Prestige checks made in the settlement.

Starting at 7th level, you craft a second bardic legend. Commoners are either more amenable or afraid of you, depending on the type of bardic legend you create.

You gain advantage on checks made using the chosen skill to influence any commoner that has heard your bardic legend.

Beginning at 11th level, whenever you enter a settlement, you can name a new bardic legend of your choice. Allies that are part of the tale gain inspiration when they finish a long rest in that settlement. Any other creatures that are part of that tale have their reputations ruined�either they confront you directly to stop the rumor, or they are unable to hide or deal in that town for the length of time you are in it. Once you have used this feature in a settlement, you can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

###### Battle Hymn Focus

Also at 4th level, at the end of another creature�s turn, you can use your reaction to activate a battle hymn. This battle hymn replaces any currently activated battle hymns. Replacing an activated battle hymn does not require expending a use of Bardic Inspiration if the previously activated hymn doesn�t have a target.

In addition, choose one of the following.

* Your battle hymns don�t require concentration.
* Your battle hymns can affect a number of additional creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one).
* You learn an additional battle hymn, which doesn�t count against the number of battle hymns you know. When choosing this battle hymn, treat your bard level as four higher for the purposes of meeting the hymn�s prerequisites. If you change

this Battle Hymn Focus, you forget the additional battle hymn.

At 8th level, the range of your battle hymns increases to 60 feet.

In addition, choose one of the following.

* You can expend two uses of Bardic Inspiration to activate two Battle Hymns at the same time. Losing concentration or changing battle hymns ends both hymns.
* Pick three spells of 4th-level or lower that have only vocalized components. These spells can be from any class spell list. You can spend two uses of Bardic Inspiration to cast one of the chosen spells at the start of your turn without using

an action. If you do, you can�t activate a battle hymn that turn.

* When you expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to activate a battle hymn, you can also grant a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature within 60 feet.

Whenever you gain a bard level, you can change your Battle Hymn Specialization.

Art Mastery

At 11th level, you gain one of the following art masteries. At 17th level, you gain an additional art mastery.

**Percussion: Rolling Rhythm.** When using a percussion instrument as a spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can target an additional creature. The additional target must be within range of the first (as if the original target were casting the spell). You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) per rest.

**String Instruments: Melody for All.**

You gain a number of melody charges equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), which you regain whenever you finish a long rest. When using a string instrument as a spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can spend a melody charge to target an additional creature within the spell�s range.

**Visual: Dual Masterpiece.** When using visual art as a spell focus, if you cast a bard spell that uses an ally as its point of origin and then cast that spell again on your next turn, the spell is cast as if you had used a spell slot two levels higher. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

**Voice: Everlasting Song.** When concentrating on a bard spell you cast using your voice as a spell focus, you automatically succeed on checks made to maintain concentration on that spell.

**Wind Instruments: Perfect Pitch.** While using a wind instrument as a spell focus, you gain advantage on Deception

and Performance checks to conceal the casting of bard spells.

###### Universal Trick

###### Grand Battle Hymns

At 17th level, you learn one of the following grand battle hymns, which doesn�t count against the number of battle hymns you know.

**Beyond the Grave.** When you activate this hymn, each ally within 60 feet that is bloodied or unconscious is restored to half their hit point maximum. In addition, each target recovers from up to 3 levels of fatigue.

**Magic Never Dies.** When you activate this hymn, each ally within 30 feet regains up to five levels worth of spell slots or gains 30 temporary hit points.

**Taste of Victory.** When you activate this hymn, each ally within 30 feet of you gains a blessing of victory that lasts for 24 hours or until it is expended. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or contested ability check, they can expend their blessing of victory to gain advantage on the roll.

Once you have activated your grand battle hymn, you can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

###### Virtuoso

At 20th level, you can use an action and expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to start an epic performance that lasts for 1d4 rounds. While the performance lasts, you can choose up to 50 creatures that are within 120 feet and that can hear or see your performance. Each creature you choose makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you

for the performance�s duration and for 6 days afterwards, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. A charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance.

The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced, or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). At the end of the performance, you can extend the duration by 1d4 rounds by expending an additional use of Bardic Inspiration.

If your epic performance lasts at least 1 minute, when the performance ends each charmed creature you choose is affected by a *mass suggestion* spell cast at 9th level.

Creatures do not make saving throws to resist this effect. The commands you give a charmed creature are not obvious, and other creatures must make an Insight check contested by your Performance check to notice that you are doing anything more than giving a performance. You can give each creature its own set of commands but can give out only six different sets of commands.

Once you use this feature, you can�t use it again until you finish a long rest.

You can speak, sign, and understand the secret language Druidic. You can write in Druidic, which looks like random scratches to non-speakers. Non-Druidic speakers can spot Druidic and discern that it is writing with a successful DC 15 Perception check but can�t read it without magic.

##### Spellcasting

Cantrips

You learn two druid cantrips of your choice at 1st level and additional druid cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid Spells table. You also know the *druidcraft* cantrip.

Preparing and Casting Spells

To prepare druid spells to make them available to cast, choose a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell) from the druid spell list. You can�t prepare a spell with a higher level than your highest-level spell slot.

To cast a druid spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell�s level or higher. The Druid Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Casting spells doesn�t remove them from your list of prepared spells.

During a long rest, you can change your list of prepared spells by meditating.

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier to set the attack bonus and saving throw DC for your druid spells, as follows:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell you know as a ritual if that spell can be cast as a ritual.

Spellcasting Focus

##### Druid Archetype

At 2nd level, you choose a circle of druids to identify with. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##### Wild Shape

At 2nd level, you know 3 wild shapes of your choice for creatures of CR 1/2 or less that have the beast or plant type. You learn additional and more powerful wild shapes of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Wild Shapes Known column of the Druid table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wild shapes you know with a new one.

As an action you can magically assume one of your known wild shapes. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into a creature, you

gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d4 � the creature�s CR (minimum 1d4). You can stay in a wild shape for a number of hours equal to your druid level. You then

revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* You use the statistics of the creature, except you retain your hit points and hit dice, personality, the ability to speak and understand any languages you know, and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has a higher bonus to a skill or saving throw, you may use the creature�s bonus instead.
* You gain all of the wild shape�s senses, movement speeds, resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities, traits, actions, and attacks. If you use a creature�s Multiattack action, you can�t make any further attacks that turn, even if another feature would normally allow you to do so.
* While in a wild shape, your Armor Class equals 12 + 1/4 your druid level, as shown on the Wild Shapes table. If your wild shape would have a higher AC, you may use that instead.
* While in a wild shape, you can only cast spells with a range of Self or Touch. You can perform the verbal and somatic components of such spells while in a wild shape, and your wild shape itself acts as your

spellcasting focus. Transforming doesn�t break your concentration on a spell you�ve already cast, nor does it prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you�ve already cast.

* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, destiny, or culture and can use them if your wild shape is physically capable of doing so. However, you can�t utilize any features gained from your heritage or heritage gift while in a wild shape.
* Any equipment you are wearing or wielding merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with your form has no effect until you leave the form.

You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and while using Wild Shape.

You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of life around you and how to divert it as you see fit. You can cast the spells *power word kill* and *true resurrection* without expending a spell slot and without any material components. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

In addition, the area in a 20-foot radius around the target becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.

**Water.** You create a 20-foot-tall,

20-foot-wide wave that travels 30 feet in one direction and then crashes down. Any Large or smaller objects and creatures in

You may decide the action the plant takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area.

**TABLE: ELEMENTAL MASTERY WILDERNESS GUARDIANS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **GUARDIAN TYPE** | **BASE CREATURE** |
| Air | Air elemental |
| Earth | Earth elemental |
| Fire | Fire elemental |
| Water | Water elemental |

**Armor Class.** The guardian�s Armor Class increases by 2.

**Challenge.** The guardian�s challenge rating increases to CR 7.

**Languages.** The guardian speaks Primordial, in addition to any other languages it knows.

**New Trait: Primal Force.** The guardian gains +1 bonus to attack rolls with its weapon attacks and deals an extra 5 force damage on a hit.

**Multiattack.** If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the guardian uses its Engulf on it.

**New Action: Engulf.** The guardian engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed creature is blinded, restrained, can�t breathe, and at the start of each of the guardian�s turns it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 + 4 bludgeoning damage (or fire damage for a fire guardian). If the guardian moves,

the engulfed creature moves with it. The guardian can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

**New Action: Guard Life.** The guardian uses its Engulf on a willing or unconscious ally without dealing damage. While engulfed, the ally is grappled but not restrained, can see and breathe normally, and has total cover.

**Enraged Fauna.** Up to three Huge native creatures of CR 8 or lower charge forward, bowling into your enemies. Choose any number of creatures you can see within 100 feet. Each creature makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC, taking 6d8 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

In addition, you can choose one of the Huge creatures to stay and fight. Only one such creature can assist in this way at a time, and the creature retreats when bloodied or when you command it to leave.

**Rushing Stampede.** A Huge-sized horde of Small, Medium, and Large native creatures hurry through the area, traveling in a straight, 30-foot-wide line from a point you choose. Until the start of your next turn, the area is difficult terrain. In addition, each creature you chose in the area when you summon the stampede makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone,

and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a success, the creature instead takes half damage and is rattled until the start of your next turn.

**Swarming Pests.** Several

Medium-sized swarms of Tiny native creatures enter the spaces of up to five Small, Medium, or Large creatures you choose, or the space of one Huge or Gargantuan creature.

##### Beast Friend

If you spend 10 minutes befriending and feeding a Medium or smaller beast of CR 1/8 or less, you become its guardian ranger. It follows you and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The beast won�t attack except as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal and makes death saving throws. You can be a guardian ranger to only one beast at a time.

##### Build Shelter

You can spend 8 hours building a basic shelter that protects up to eight Medium or smaller creatures from the elements and reduces the likelihood of attack from monsters and bandits. The shelter counts as a haven. It lasts for as long as it is needed but falls apart permanently after being left for a month unattended.

Once you have used this knack, you can�t do so again for 7 days.

##### Calls of the Wild

Using verbal and nonverbal cues to communicate with beasts, you can gain basic information from them or make a simple request (like delivering a short message or small object).

##### Ear to the Ground

If you spend 1 minute without moving, you can deduce information about your environment in a 30-foot radius, as if using blindsight or tremorsense. The effect ends if you move or take an action.

##### Expert Foraging

Once between long rests, you can take 1 minute to collect a number of edible, non-poisonous plants and grubs equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature can use its action to eat up to five plants or grubs, each of which restores 1 hit point. The grubs die and spoil 1 hour after being collected.

##### Forced Marcher

You can travel an additional number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to make a Constitution saving throw for a forced march.

##### Guide

##### Longwalker

When you would gain a level of fatigue due to lack of Supply during a journey, you don�t gain that level of fatigue.

##### Master Tracker

*Prerequisite: 9th level*

Once between long rests, while outdoors you can spend 5 minutes scouring the ground in a

30-foot-diameter area for clues. You learn all events that transpired in the area in the last 24 hours as though you had witnessed them yourself, although you don�t learn secret information not obvious to an observer. The information

you gain is only that which would be learned by sight.

##### Monster Mimic

By imitating how a beast or one of your studied adversaries sounds, looks, and moves, you can gain advantage on Deception and Intimidation checks made to convince a creature that it is seeing or hearing that beast or studied adversary.

##### Poisons and Antidotes

Once between long rests, you can spend 1 hour searching your environment and make a DC 10 Survival check. On a success, you collect poisonous plants. You can spend 10 minutes to extract three doses of liquid poison from the plants. A creature that ingests a dose of the poison makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or is poisoned for 1 hour. Alternatively, you can spend 1 hour to create one dose of antitoxin.

##### Read the Room

By spending 10 minutes observing facial expressions, body language, and vocal intonation, you can detect minute details that give you insight into the nature of creatures within 30 feet of you. For the next minute, you can direct your focus on any one creature you can see within 30 feet.You learn the surface thoughts of the creature�what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can shift your attention to another creature�s thoughts. Creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or that doesn�t speak a language can�t be studied in this way.

##### See the Unseen

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

Once between long rests, you can focus your attention on peripheral sights, sounds, and other signs of unseen passage. For the next hour, you can detect invisible creatures and objects, their location, movement, and actions, and even sense creatures and objects in the Ethereal Plane.

Spell Slots

To cast a sorcerer spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell�s level or higher.

The Sorcerer Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know your choice of four 1st-level spells from the sorcerer spell list. Consult the Spells Known column of the Sorcerer Spells table to see when you can choose more sorcerer spells. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace a sorcerer spell you know with another from the sorcerer spell list, provided it is of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier to set the saving throw DC for your sorcerer spells and spell attack rolls, as follows:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spellcasting Focus

When casting a sorcerer spell, you can use an arcane focus as your spellcasting focus.

##### Source of Magic

At 2nd level, you gain sorcery points.

As a bonus action, you can convert sorcery points into one spell slot or vice versa, using Table: Creating Spell Slots. You can�t convert 6th-level or higher slots.

##### Manifestation

Also at 2nd level, choose one of the following manifestations. When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can change the damage type to your manifestation�s damage type.

Blizzard (Cold)

When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes cold damage from the spell, it is also chilled, reducing its movement speeds by 10 feet for a number of rounds equal to the spell�s level (minimum 1 round).

Corrosion (Acid)

When you cast a spell that deals acid damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes acid damage from the spell, its Armor Class is reduced by 2 until the end of your next turn.

Hurricane (Lightning or Thunder)

You can treat both lightning and thunder as your manifestation�s damage types. When you cast a spell that deals lightning or thunder damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to produce a thunderous blast around you. Large or smaller creatures within 5 feet of you make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.

Inferno (Fire)

When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes fire damage from the spell, it is also set ablaze, taking 2d4

ongoing fire damage for a number of rounds equal to the spell�s level, or until it uses an action to put itself out.

Venom (Poison)

When you cast a spell that deals poison damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point. If you do, creatures immune to poison damage take half damage from the spell, and creatures resistant to poison damage take full damage.

##### Latent Power

At 3rd level, choose one of the following.

All Eyes

You gain an expertise die on Performance and Persuasion checks. In addition, as a bonus action you can spend 1 sorcery point to put out a subtle pulse that causes all creatures within 60 feet to take notice of you, allowing you to speak and be heard even in the midst of chaos. During combat, this notice lasts only a split second�not long enough to distract, but allowing you to make a Charisma check as part of the bonus action used to activate this feature.

Daunting Energy

You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. If you fail an ability check or saving throw against a creature trying to intimidate you, or against an effect that would cause you to become frightened, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the check or save. If you do, you must use the new result.

Unsuspecting

You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When you fail a Deception check against a humanoid, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the check. On a success, their memory skips a beat and fills in the gap with your new story. On a

failure, not only do they not believe you, but anyone who can cast spells and observed the exchange (including your target, if applicable) recognizes your attempt at arcane subterfuge.

##### Metamagic

At 3rd level, you gain two minor Metamagic options, and one moderate Metamagic option. You gain another minor Metamagic option at 5th level, 10th level, 15th level, and 19th level. You gain an additional moderate Metamagic option at 10th and 19th level. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Metamagic option with another of the same degree, instead of replacing a spell.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

Minor Metamagic

**Delayed Spell.** When you ready a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point. The spell can be held for up to 1 minute, instead of until the start of your next turn.

**Distant Spell**. When you cast a spell that has a range listed in feet, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of a spell. If you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 20 feet.

**Persistent Spell**. When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the duration, to a maximum of 24 hours.

**Reliable Spell*.*** When you roll a 4 or lower on a spell attack, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the attack. If you do, you must use the new result. You can use Reliable Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option on the spell.

**Subdual Spell**. When damage from one of your spells reduces one or more creatures to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to

stabilize one of the creatures knocked unconscious by it.

**Subtle Spell*.*** You can spend 1 sorcery point to cast a spell without vocalized or seen components.

**Treacherous Spell*.*** When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to alter its components in subtle ways. A creature attempting to identify the spell based on its components perceives it as a different spell of your choice of the same or lower level. Attempts to interrupt this spell via *counterspell* are made at disadvantage.

Moderate Metamagic

**Careful Spell.** When you cast a spell with an Iinstantaneous duration that affects an area, you can spend 1 sorcery point. If you do, choose a number of creatures in the area up to your Charisma modifier (minimum one creature). Creatures you choose are unaffected by the spell.

**Empowered Spell.** When you roll a spell�s damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). If you do, you must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option on the spell.

**Heightened Spell.** When a creature makes a saving throw to avoid or resist the effects of a spell you cast, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give that target disadvantage on its initial saving throw against the spell.

**Quickened Spell.** When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast it as a bonus action instead.

**Reflexive Spell.** Immediately before rolling initiative, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast a spell of up to 3rd-level that has a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action. The spell activates before any other actions in initiative, but doing so uses your action for your first turn in the combat.

**Refracting Spell.** When you cast a spell that involves a spell attack roll and targets only a single creature, you can spend an additional 2 sorcery points. If the spell hits, a creature within 5 feet of the original target takes half the spell�s damage.

**Twinned Spell*.*** When you target a creature with a spell that can target only one creature at the level it is cast and doesn�t have a range of Self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell�s level (minimum 1) to target a second creature within range with the same spell.

##### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.

##### Arcane Innovations

At 4th level, you gain an arcane innovation of your choice. Your arcane innovations are detailed at the end of the class description. The Innovations Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you gain additional innovations.

##### Arcane Refinement

At 6th level, choose one of the following.

Deep Source

When you finish a short rest, you can expend a number of Hit Dice up to your Charisma modifier to regain some of your magic essence. For each Hit Die you expend, you regain 2 sorcery points.

Once you have used this feature, you can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Patient Aptitude

Choose a number of spells with the ritual tag equal to your Charisma modifier.

These spells need not be from the sorcerer spell list, but they must be of a

level for which you have spell slots. You can cast these spells as rituals, though you don�t gain the ability to cast them normally with spell slots. The spells don�t count toward your spells known. If you increase your Charisma modifier, the number of ritual spells you know also increases. Each time you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one of these ritual spells with another eligible spell.

Prodigious Innovator

You learn three cantrips from any spell list. These cantrips don�t count toward your cantrips known.

##### Rapturous Presence

At 9th level, choose one of the following.

Larger Than Life

You have advantage on Intimidation checks made to threaten someone with your magic. On a failure, your target is unconvinced, and unless you make good on your threat, this feature no longer functions until you prove your reputation again. Additionally, features and traits that attempt to evaluate how tough you are, such as the fighter�s Size Up, always give the impression that you are more dangerous than you actually are.

Nobody�s Fool

You gain a bonus to Insight checks equal to your Charisma modifier. In addition, you can spend 1 sorcery point as an action to project a magical aura of honesty. For the next 10 minutes, creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on Deception checks made to lie or conceal the truth. When a creature in this aura fails a Deception check, it accidentally blurts out something it didn�t mean to while attempting to spin its lie.

Otherworldly

Select three of the following creature types: aberration, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead. You have advantage on Charisma checks to make a first impression on a creature of one of your chosen types, and if you do not share a common language, you can still communicate some simple concepts to them such as �friendly,� �help,� and �run.� In addition, by spending 2 sorcery points and 1 minute in meditation, you can change your creature type to one of the chosen creature types. This transformation lasts for 1 hour or until you repeat the meditation and spend 2 sorcery points to reverse it.

##### Evolving Manifestation

At 12th level, you gain the improved form of the manifestation you selected at 2nd level. Alternatively, you can choose an additional manifestation from the Manifestation list.

Evolving Blizzard

When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals cold damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain 1d6 temporary hit points per level of the spell. While you have these temporary hit points, whenever a creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, that creature takes 1d10 cold damage. The temporary hit points last 1 hour.

Evolving Corrosion

When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals acid damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to create a

10-foot-radius pool of acid centered on either the target of the spell or the spell�s point of origin. The area becomes difficult terrain, and whenever a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 2d8 acid damage. The pool remains for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to dismiss it.

Evolving Hurricane

When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to create a 15-foot-radius storm centered on you. The storm moves with you when you move. The area of the storm is heavily obscured and counts as difficult terrain, but you can see and move through it normally. At the end of each of your subsequent turns, you can spend an additional sorcery point to maintain the storm. Otherwise, it dissipates.

Evolving Inferno

When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals fire damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to store some of the spell�s energy as a flame you hold in one hand. You can use an action to throw this flame, making a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 30 feet. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage per level of the spell you cast to trigger this effect. The flame lasts for up to 1 minute or until it is thrown.

Evolving Venom

When you cast a spell that deals poison damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes poison damage from the spell, it takes 2d6 ongoing poison damage for 1 minute or until a creature uses an action to treat the poison by making a Medicine check against your spell save DC.

##### Major Metamagic

At 15th level, in addition to a minor metamagic option, you gain one major metamagic option. You gain an additional major metamagic option at 20th level.

Major Metamagic Options

**Consumptive Spell.** When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 4

sorcery points. You or a creature you can see within 10 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the spell�s damage roll. If you roll the spell�s damage multiple times, you only restore hit points from the first roll.

**Contingent Spell*.*** When you cast a spell, rather than have it go off immediately, you can spend 6 sorcery points and describe an external condition. If that condition occurs before you finish a long rest, you can use your reaction to trigger the spell. You can have only one Contingent Spell at a time.

**Echo Spell*.*** When you cast a spell of 5th-level or lower, you can spend sorcery points equal to the sorcery point conversion cost for a spell slot of that level (see Table: Creating Spell Slots).

The spell repeats on the next turn, originating from the same point and aimed at the same target as the first instance of the spell.

**Intense Spell*.*** When you cast a spell that deals damage, before rolling damage or determining the result of any of the spell�s attack rolls or saving throws, you can spend sorcery points equal to the spell�s level. If you do, the spell deals its maximum possible damage to one target.

##### Arcane Clutch

Starting at 20th level, you can reclaim some fraction of the energies you expend as you cast. Whenever you cast a spell of 3rd-level or higher, you regain sorcery points equal to one-third of the expended spell slot�s level.

##### Explosive Magics

Also at 20th level, the magic you bring to bear can be made to build upon itself. When you cast a spell of 4th-level or lower that deals damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to half the spell�s level (minimum 1) to reroll any dice that have the maximum result and add them to the total. For example, if you cast an exploding *fireball* and roll three 6s among your damage dice, you roll an additional 3d6 and

continue rerolling any 6s, adding them to the total damage dealt.

## Arcane Innovations

When you gain access to a new arcane innovation, choose one of the following.

##### Draw Nourishment

You can spend 3 sorcery points before eating a pound of just about anything organic�bark, grass, cactus flesh, bone, whatever�s at hand�and so long as you can stomach the taste, it counts as 1 Supply for you as your body transmutes it into something more edible. A poisonous substance consumed in this way is still poisonous.

##### Hot Air

Any time you have sorcery points remaining, your weight is reduced by half, and you take half damage from falling. Additionally, if you are carrying less than a quarter of your maximum equipment load, you float on water.

##### Lingering Touch

When you encounter a shed piece of a creature (such as a lock of hair, a bloody bandage, a scale, or a tooth), you can touch that object and instantly attune to it as if it were a magic item. While you are attuned to the object, when you see the creature from which it originated, you immediately know that it belongs to that creature, at which point the attunement ends. At the Narrator�s discretion, you might learn additional cryptic information as a result of being attuned to such things.

##### Mage Hunter

When tracking a creature that can cast at least one spell, you can focus on the

mystic energy it leaves in its wake, allowing you to use your Charisma for any ability checks made to track it.

##### Magnetic Step

You can move along vertical surfaces at half your Sspeed without needing to make an ability check. If you end your turn on such a surface, you immediately fall unless you have some other way to support yourself.

##### Retrace

By spending 1 minute in meditation, you can reflect on the magical aura you leave behind as you travel. After doing so, you can perfectly retrace the steps you�ve taken in the past 4 hours.

##### Strange Traces

While traveling, you can spend 1 sorcery point to obscure your trail. For the next hour, any tracks your group leaves become random, zigzagging, and incomprehensible. Creatures have disadvantage on Survival checks to track you and become lost on a failed check.

##### Ominous Insight

When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, you can draw on your magics to find an answer and reroll the check. On a failure, your attempt clouds your mind and you have disadvantage on Intelligence checks until you finish a rest. While your mind remains clouded, you can�t use Ominous Insight again.

##### Wode Sense

While traveling, any time you enter illusory terrain or magic causes you to become lost, you notice within 1 minute of being affected.

## Sorcerer Archetypes

##### Sorcerer Archetype Spells

You know additional spells from your sorcerer archetype. At 1st level, choose one spell from the 1st-level row of your archetype�s Archetype Spells table and add it to your spell list. It does not count against your total spells known. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, choose an additional spell from a row on the table equal to or lower than your sorcerer level. When you gain a level, you can replace one of your archetype spells with an archetype spell of equal or lower level.

##### Draconist

**TABLE: DRACONIST ARCHETYPE SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **SORCERER LEVEL** | **ARCHETYPE SPELLS** |
| 1st | *animal friendship, burning hands, charm person, thunderwave* |
| 3rd | *alter self, gust of wind, scorching ray, shatter* |
| 5th | *fear, fireball, fly, lightning bolt* |
| 7th | *dominate beast, ice storm, private sanctum, wall of fire* |
| 9th | *cone of cold, dominate person, insect plague, legend lore* |

Draconic Toughness

At 1st level when you choose this archetype, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain a sorcerer level. Also, when you are unarmored, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

Voice of the Dragon

Also at 1st level, you understand the language of dragons. You can speak, sign, read, and write Draconic. You have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence the behavior of dragons, so long as you converse with them in their native tongue.

Lord Among Beasts and Mortals

Starting at 6th level, when you start a rest in an area that isn�t within 1 mile of an established settlement, you can spend 10 minutes in communion with the land to protect your camp until you finish your rest. Beasts who approach within 100 feet of your camp become docile and placid, refusing to attack you or your companions. Additionally, friendly creatures in your camp gain advantage on Perception checks to spot danger, as well as on Intimidation checks against intruders.

If you repeat this effect every day in the same location for a year, the radius of the effect increases to 500 feet, and the effect becomes permanent. When you have a permanent lair, your Prestige increases by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. You can have only one permanent lair at a time, and the effect fades if you are ever away from your lair for a year or longer. If you die, the effect fades after 2d10 days.

Soaring Wings

Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to sprout dragon wings. The wings grant you a flying speed equal to your Speed. You can dismiss these wings as a bonus action. You can�t manifest the wings while wearing armor, unless the armor has been specially modified for that purpose (increasing its cost by 50 percent). The wings tear clothing that is not similarly modified.

Draconic Presence

Starting at 18th level, you can use an action and spend 5 sorcery points to exude a

60-foot aura of your choice of awe or fear. For 1 minute, when a hostile creature starts its turn in this aura it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it becomes charmed (in an awe aura) or frightened (in a fear aura) until the aura ends. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to your Draconic Presence for 24 hours.

##### Enigma

**TABLE: ENIGMA ARCHETYPE SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **SORCERER LEVEL** | **ARCHETYPE SPELLS** |
| 1st | *color spray, faerie fire, grease, hideous laughter* |
| 3rd | *blindness/deafness, enlarge/reduce, levitate, shatter* |
| 5th | *darklight, fear, hypnotic pattern, stinking cloud* |
| 7th | *black tentacles, confusion, hallucinatory terrain, phantasmal killer* |
| 9th | *cloudkill, flame strike, wall of force, wall of stone* |

Deeper Understanding

Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, you gain an expertise die on ability checks made to identify spells being cast or sense the presence of lingering magic in any form.

Reach Beyond

Also at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to attempt to replace one of your archetype spells. Declare which spell you�re trying to replace and make a Charisma saving throw (DC 10 + the spell�s level). On a success, you replace the spell with

another archetype spell of the same or lower level until you finish a long rest, at which point the original spell returns to your spell list. This newly gained spell can�t be replaced again.

On a failure, the new spell isn�t added to your spell list, and you inadvertently cast the spell you�re attempting to replace, expending no spell slots but targeting a creature or point within range of the Narrator�s choice (possibly yourself). The spell is too wild to alter with metamagic, and if it requires concentration it instead lasts its full duration with no concentration required. The archetype spell you attempted to replace is then removed from your spell list until you finish a long rest, at which point it returns.

Retributive Surge

At 6th level, when a creature you can see damages you, you can use your reaction to cast a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. The spell must either target the creature that damaged you or be centered on a space it occupies. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, and you must spend sorcery points equal to the spell�s level, in addition to the spell slot you used to cast the spell.

At 14th and 18th level, the highest level of spell you can cast in this way increases by 1.

Tenuous Serenity

At 14th level, when you make a Charisma saving throw, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add an expertise die to the roll, or to reroll an expertise die used in the roll. You can do so after seeing the result of the saving throw.

Additionally, when you finish a short rest, select a spell that�s been removed from your spell list by one of your class features. You reclaim the spell. Once you�ve used this feature to reclaim a lost spell, you can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Erupting Nova

At 18th level, you can cast two spells simultaneously, expending spell slots for each, so long as both spells have a casting time of 1 action, the sum of their levels is less than 6, and neither spell requires concentration. When you do so, make a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the sum of the spells� levels). On a failure, you waste your action (but not any spell slots) and both spells are removed from your spell list until you finish a long rest.

##### Traveler

**TABLE: TRAVELER ARCHETYPE SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **SORCERER LEVEL** | **ARCHETYPE SPELLS** |

Beyond the Boundary

At 1st level, you can speak, sign, read, and write Primordial.

In addition, you can use Charisma when making an ability check to navigate, survive in, or remember information about planes of existence other than the Material Plane.

Flutter

Also at 1st level, after you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can teleport a short distance to an unoccupied space you can

see. The maximum range of this teleportation is equal to 5 feet + 5 feet per level of the spell.

Gift of Impermanence

Starting at 6th level, once per round when you fail a saving throw against an effect that would cause you to become grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, or stunned, you can spend 1 sorcery point, and reroll one d20 used in the saving throw.

All Terrains

At 14th level, choose one of the following boons:

* You ignore difficult terrain.
* You ignore the effects of extreme heat, extreme cold, and high altitude.
* You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed.
* You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
* You can spend 1 sorcery point to gain a fly speed equal to your Speed for 1 hour.

When you finish a long rest, you can replace your active boon with a different boon from this list.

Touch the Void

At 18th level, you can spend 1 hour in meditation to cast *astral projection, dream*, or *etherealness*. Each of these spells is slightly different when cast using this feature, as described below:

**Astral Projection.** The spell requires no material components, but it only affects you.

**Dream.** You are the messenger in the dream, and while you are influencing the dream you are unaware of your surroundings.

**Etherealness.** When the spell ends, you reappear in the space you were in when you originally cast the spell.

Once you have used this feature, you can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Your choice of archetype grants you an

expanded spell list and additional features at 1st, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##### Pact Magic

With care, practice, and dedication you have learned to siphon and channel the otherworldly powers you�ve gained from your patron.

Cantrips

You learn two warlock cantrips of your choice at 1st level and additional warlock cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. If you gain a bonus cantrip, it doesn�t count against your cantrips known.

Spell Points

The Warlock table shows how many spell points you have. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of spell points dependent on the spell�s level, as shown on the table below. You can also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by expending the appropriate number of spell points.

**TABLE: SPELL POINTS**

| **SPELL LEVEL** | **SPELL POINTS** |
| 1st | 2 |
| 2nd | 3 |
| 3rd | 5 |

Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher

You know your choice of two 1st-level warlock spells, and you learn more according to the Spells Known column of the Warlock table. Each of these spells must be of a level that you are able to cast. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new 1st- or 2nd-level spell.

Additionally, when you gain a warlock level, you can replace one warlock spell you know with another warlock spell, which also must be of a level you can cast.

If you gain a bonus spell, it doesn�t count against your spells known.

Spellcasting Ability

Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Once you make this choice, you can�t change it. You use the chosen ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use that ability modifier to set the saving throw DC for your warlock spells and spell attack rolls, as follows:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier

Spellcasting Focus

When casting a warlock spell, you can use an arcane focus as your spellcasting focus.

##### Eldritch Blast

At 1st level, choose one of the following features.

Eldritch Disturbance

You can use an action to strike a creature you can see within 60 feet with a

reality-distorting curse, blending pain both

mental and physical. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 1d10 force damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

Eldritch Ray

You can use an action to create a deadly beam that strikes a creature within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature, dealing 1d10 force damage on a hit.

Eldritch Scythe

Once per turn when you would make a melee weapon attack as part of the Attack action or an opportunity attack, you can instead make a melee spell attack, lashing out with an ephemeral and unearthly blade. On hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. In addition, you can choose a creature that you can see and that is within your reach. That creature takes half as much damage.

Eldritch Whip

You can use an action to thrash a creature with a scintillating tendril of arcane force. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 15 feet, dealing 1d6 force damage on a hit.

At the end of your turn you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage you dealt with Eldritch Whip this turn (minimum 1). These temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn. When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Whip and you already have temporary hit points, you can end the temporary hit points early to gain a bonus to the Eldritch Whip�s damage roll equal to half the temporary hit points you ended early.

##### Eldritch Invocations

You gain an eldritch invocation of your choice at 2nd level and additional invocations at higher warlock levels, as

shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a warlock level, you can replace one of the invocations you know with another invocation that you could learn at that level. If you gain a bonus invocation, it doesn�t count against your Invocations known.

**Extra Secrets of Arcana.** Whenever you would learn a new invocation in this way, you can learn a secret of arcana instead.

##### Secrets of Arcana

Also at 2nd level, you gain a secret of arcana of your choice. Your secrets are detailed at the end of the class description. The Secrets Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more secrets of arcana.

##### Pact Boon

At 3rd level, choose one of the following features.

Pact of the Blade

You can use your action to conjure in your empty hand an armament bestowed with power: a pact weapon. Choose any simple or martial weapon when you conjure your pact weapon. You are proficient with your pact weapon while you wield it, and you can use your spellcasting ability for attack and damage rolls with it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away for 1 minute, if you die, if you use this feature again, or if you dismiss the weapon (no action required).

By performing a 1-hour ritual while holding a magic weapon or rare weapon (but not an artifact or sentient weapon), you can transform it into your pact weapon. If this weapon has a bonus to attack or damage rolls, or if it deals bonus damage, you can apply these to your

Eldritch Blast (a ranged weapon adds these bonuses to Eldritch Ray, and a melee weapon adds them to Eldritch Scythe; the weapon has no effect on Eldritch Disturbance or Eldritch Whip). The weapon disappears into an extradimensional space when not used, and it appears whenever you conjure your pact weapon. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the ritual on a different weapon, or if you perform the ritual to break your bond to the weapon. The weapon is collected by your patron if the bond breaks while it is in the extradimensional space.

Pact of the Chain

You learn the *find familiar* spell as a bonus spell, and you can cast it as a ritual. When you cast the spell, in addition to the normal forms you can choose, you can choose an imp, pseudodragon, quasit, sprite, or any Tiny creature of CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt for the spirit you call forth to be of the aberration, elemental, or undead type.

When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack using its reaction. Additionally, when you use Eldritch Scythe, you can choose to make the attack through your familiar as though you had cast a spell with a range of Touch.

Pact of the Tome

You awaken to find a grimoire left in your pack by your patron: a Book of Shadows. Choose three bonus cantrips. While the book is in your possession, you know these cantrips and they are treated as warlock spells. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to receive a replacement from your patron, destroying the previous book. The book is collected by your patron when you die.

##### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.

##### Invocation of the Courts

Also at 4th level, you gain a bonus invocation. Choose one invocation from the following list: Beguiling Influence, Courts of the Outer Realms, Eyes of the Runekeeper, Gaze of Two Minds, Mask of Many Faces, Ominous Tormentor, Psionic Secrecy, Spellbinding Contract, Voice of the Chain Master, Whispers of the Grave.

You gain another bonus invocation at 10th level and again at 16th level. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bonus invocations you gained in this way and replace it with another bonus invocation from the list.

##### Extra Blast

Starting at 5th level, when you use Eldritch Ray, Eldritch Scythe, or Eldritch Whip as your action on your turn, you can attack twice instead of once, provided you make no weapon attacks. At 11th level you can make three attacks, and at 17th level you can make four attacks.

In addition, your Eldritch Disturbance damage increases by 1d10 at 5th level, and again at 11th level and 17th level (to a maximum of 4d10).

These benefits are based on your warlock level, not your character level. This feature otherwise counts as Extra Attack (for the purpose of qualifying for feats, spell effects, and the like).

##### Eldritch Evolution

At 6th level, you gain a bonus invocation�one that represents your growth in the lethal lore behind Eldritch Blast.

Choose one invocation from the following list: Agonizing Blast, Eldritch Bind, Eldritch Elementalism, Eldritch Grasp, Eldritch Prism, Eldritch Riposte, Eldritch Severance,

Eldritch Spear, Eldritch Squall, Eldritch Tentacle, Repelling Blast, Versatile Blast.

You gain another bonus invocation at 12th level and again at 18th level. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bonus invocations you gained in this way and replace it with another bonus invocation from the list.

##### Dread Thaumaturge

At 20th level, you have learned all you can from your patron. You gain the following abilities.

Aura of Anathema

Creatures you choose gain vulnerability to necrotic damage while within 120 feet of you. A creature with resistance to necrotic damage instead loses its resistance, and a creature immune to necrotic damage instead replaces that immunity with resistance.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose a different damage type for your aura.

Highest Arcanum

You learn an ultimate exploit in the laws of magic. Choose one of the following:

* Once between rests, you can cast *plane shift* without material components.
* You are under the constant effects of the *foresight* spell. This effect can�t be detected or dispelled by any means short of a *wish* spell.

##### Spellcasting

At 1st level you have a spellbook containing the written spells you study. You use your spellbook to cast your spells.

Cantrips

You learn three wizard cantrips of your choice at 1st level and additional wizard cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard Spells table. Additionally, you know the *prestidigitation* cantrip.

Spellbook

At 1st level, your spellbook contains six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook contains all of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which you maintain in your memory.

Preparing and Casting Spells

To prepare wizard spells to make them available to cast, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to

your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). You can�t prepare a spell with a higher level than your highest-level spell slot.

To cast a wizard spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell�s level or higher. The Wizard Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Casting spells doesn�t remove them from your list of prepared spells.

During a long rest, you can change your list of prepared spells by studying your spellbook.

Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier to set the saving throw DC for your wizard spells and spell attack rolls, as follows:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell in your spellbook as a ritual if that spell can be cast as a ritual.

Spellcasting Focus

When casting a wizard spell, you can use an arcane focus as your spellcasting focus.

Learning Spells of 1st-Level and Higher

Whenever you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. You can�t prepare a spell with a higher level than your highest-level spell slot.

Your Spellbook

As you research magic and spells, you will add new spells to your spellbook. **Copying a Spell into the Book**. When you find a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher in a scroll or spellbook, you can add it to your spellbook if its level isn�t higher than your highest-level spell slot. Doing so costs 2 hours and 50 gp per spell level.

**Replacing the Book**. You can copy a spell you know into another spellbook, in case you want to share a spell, create a backup copy of your spellbook, or replace a lost spellbook. Copying a spell you know costs only 1 hour and 10 gp per spell level.

##### Arcane Recovery

Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover expended spell slots with a combined level equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up). You can�t recover a 6th-level or higher spell slot.

##### Wizard Archetype

At 2nd level, you choose a tradition of magic that you have dedicated your studies to.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##### Scholarly Excellence

At 3rd level, choose one of the following:

Academic

You gain four specialties from Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, and Religion. Unlike normal specialties, academic specialties can be taken twice (increasing the specialty�s expertise die to 1d6).

In addition, when you use either Deception or Persuasion to make a point related to one of your academic specialties, you can apply your expertise die from that specialty to the check, and you can use Intelligence the check.

Ritual Efficiency

When you cast a spell as a ritual, you add only 1 minute to the casting time (instead of 10 minutes).

Rote Memorization

Choose one cantrip you know that has a casting time of 1 action and doesn�t deal damage. You can cast that cantrip as a bonus action without any seen or material components a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest. Each time you gain a wizard level, you can change the cantrip associated with this feature each time with another eligible cantrip you know.

##### Elective Studies

At 4th level you gain one elective study of your choice. Elective studies are detailed at the end of the class description. The Studies Known column of the Wizard table shows when you learn more elective studies. Unless otherwise noted, you can gain each study only once.

##### Ability Score Improvement

At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.

##### Signature Spells

At 5th level, you have developed your spellcasting skill and honed it into spells that you consider to be your Signature Spells.

Choose one 1st-level wizard spell that is in your spellbook. You always have this spell prepared, it doesn�t count toward your maximum prepared spells. In addition, once per rest you can cast this spell at its lowest level without expending a spell slot.

At higher levels, you gain additional Signature Spells, each of which you can cast once between rests. At 11th level, you can choose one 2nd-level or lower Signature Spell. At 17th level, you can

choose one 3rd-level or lower Signature Spell. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your Signature Spells with another of the same level or lower.

##### Spell Study

At 7th level, choose one Spell Study that reflects what you have dedicated your arcane studies to.

Arcane Objects

When you touch a magic item, either willingly or when you are hit by it, you are immediately aware that it�s magical. If you hold such an item in your hand, you can cast *identify* on it as an action without expending a spell slot, even if you don�t have the spell prepared.

In addition, when you cast *identify* using a spell slot or as a ritual, you also learn if the item is cursed, and the Narrator will give you a hint as to the curse�s effects (which might be cryptic and vague, but must not be a lie).

Detective Spell Study

You automatically sense the presence of magical effects, such as a spell effect on an object or a spell effect in an area, within 20 feet. You don�t know what the effects are or where they are located, only that such effects are near you.

In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add *detect magic* and *detect thoughts* to your spellbook if they weren�t already there. Whenever you cast *detect magic*, the range in which you can sense magic increases to 60 feet.

Whenever you cast *detect thoughts*, the range in which you can read thoughts increases to 60 feet.

Fauna and Flora

Your research into plants, wildlife, and the natural workings of magic grants you superior insights into the magic of living creatures and flora. When a beast or

plant makes a saving throw against a spell you cast, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

##### Wizard�s Flair

At 9th level, choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a long rest, you can replace your flair with another.

Once per rest, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can choose to cast it with your flair. You must choose whether to cast with flair when you declare you�re casting the spell, before any rolls are made.

Awe and Wonder

Choose one creature affected by the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way, it is incapacitated, has a Speed of 0, and does nothing but stare blankly at the dazzling effects of your magic. The effect ends early if the target takes damage or is forced to make a saving throw.

Terror

Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the spell. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of you until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, it starts its turn by using its full movement to get away from you in the most direct manner possible, avoiding obvious hazards along the way.

Brilliance

Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the spell. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

Warding

After casting the spell, until the start of your next turn, a creature who attempts to

attack you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must choose a new target or waste its attack.

##### Bestow Magics

At 13th level, you can transfer your magic to another creature. To do so, you must touch a willing creature, expend a spell slot of

3rd-level or lower, and concentrate for 1 minute. At the end of this time, choose a spell you have prepared of the expended spell slot�s level or lower. The creature can cast the spell using the slot you expended, following its normal rules for casting time, spell components, range, and concentration, but using your spellcasting ability modifier, spell attack modifier, and spell save DC. You can have only one spell imbued at a time. If you bestow a spell upon a different creature, the spell slot remains expended and the previous spell dissipates, its magic unspent.

##### Arcane Defenses

At 15th level, your training has granted you certain protections against magic. Choose one of the following:

Mental Discipline

Once per rest, when you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.

Mystic Mantle

You and creatures within 10 feet have resistance to damage dealt by spells.

Superior Countermagic

When you make an ability check as part of casting *counterspell* or *dispel magic*, you add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

In addition, when you cast either of these spells, treat the spell slot level of the spell as one level higher than the actual slot you spent. The slot you use to

cast the spell must still be at least 3rd-level.

##### Spell Intensity

At 18th level, choose one of the following features, which can be used to augment your wizard spells of 5th-level or lower. You must choose whether to augment the spell when you declare you�re casting it, before any rolls are made.

The first time you use this feature to augment a spell, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, your hit point maximum and current hit points are reduced by 1d12 per level of the spell you augmented (cantrips count as 1st-level spells for this purpose). This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest.

Binding

After you have affected a creature with a spell that has a duration and it is able to end the spell�s effect on itself with a successful saving throw, it must succeed on that saving throw twice to end the effect.

Burn

Any creature that takes damage from the spell takes that damage again at the start of your next turn, unless a *dispel magic* spell of any level is cast on it before then or if it�s in an *antimagic field* at the time.

Chain

If the spell you cast normally targets only a single creature, it can also target up to two more creatures within 15 feet of the initial target.

Duality

If the spell you cast requires concentration and you�re already concentrating on another spell, you can maintain concentration on both spells simultaneously. If you�re forced to make a

Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, the minimum DC is 10 + the combined levels of the two spells. On a failure, both spells end.

Overchannel

Instead of rolling damage, you instead deal maximum damage with the spell.

##### Swift Signature

At 19th level, when you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action using your Signature Spell feature, you can cast it as a bonus action instead.

##### Archmage

At 20th level, you gain the following features.

Magesight

You can�t be blinded, and you can see normally in all types of darkness (including magical) to a distance of 120 feet.

When you see a creature use Spellcasting to cast a spell, you instinctively know what spell is being cast before the casting is complete. This doesn�t tell you what level spell slot is being used to cast the spell.

True Magician

You can cast any 1st-level wizard spell you have prepared without expending a spell slot.

## Elective Studies

When you gain access to a new elective study, choose one of the following. Some studies have prerequisites, such as minimum wizard level, or another study. You must meet those requirements before you can choose that study.

##### Air Lift

You can use an action to increase your vertical jump distance to 15 feet until the end of your turn. When you jump in this way, you can also glide with the updraft, allowing you to move 10 feet horizontally for every 5 feet you descend vertically.

##### Detect Magic Savant

*Prerequisite: Able to cast detect magic*

Whenever you cast *detect magic*, you can choose one of the following benefits to amplify the spell.

**Lengthened Detect Magic.** The duration of *detect magic* increases by 10 minutes.

**Extended Detect Magic**. The detection radius of *detect magic* increases by 30 feet.

**Penetrating Detect Magic**. The spell is only blocked by 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of common metal, a 1-inch sheet of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt.

##### Eidetic Memory

Your memory is nearly perfect. You can accurately recall anything you�ve read or seen in the past month. Additionally, when retreading a route you�ve traveled in the past month, you have advantage on ability checks made against environmental hazards on that route, unless the landscape has significantly changed.

##### Illusion Detective

*Prerequisite: At least one illusion spell in your spellbook.*

You have advantage on Investigation checks and Intelligence saving throws made against illusions. When you succeed on an ability check or saving throw to see through an illusion, creatures you choose within 30 feet gain advantage on checks to see through that illusion for the next minute.

##### Loremaster of Creatures

When you gain this study, choose one creature type: beasts, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, oozes, plants, or undead. This creature type becomes your Loremaster Creature Specialty. When you encounter a creature of the same type as your Loremaster Creature Specialty, you automatically know any history, legends, or myths related to it.

##### Loremaster of Travel

You have advantage on History checks to recall information related to myths and legends that are location-based. In addition, when you arrive at a settlement for the first time, choose one of the following subjects: culture, etiquette, government, or populace. The Narrator will give you a useful fact about that subject. You gain an expertise die on ability checks related to that subject in this settlement.

##### Persistent Mending

*Prerequisite: The ability to cast mending* When you finish a long rest, choose up to six creatures who rested with you, including yourself. Choose one piece of their equipment to enchant with a persistent mending effect. The chosen item instantly fixes itself if it becomes damaged. If you choose an item from the following list, it also grants an additional benefit. This effect lasts for 12 hours.

**Coat.** Choose either cold or hot weather. The creature gains an expertise die on Constitution saving throws made to resist the effects of that kind of weather.

**Goggles.** The creature�s vision can never be reduced to less than 20 feet due to inclement weather.

**Shoes.** The creature gains an expertise die on Constitution saving throws made to undertake a forced march.

##### Presto, Prestidigitation!

*Prerequisite: The ability to cast prestidigitation*

If you are not actively casting *prestidigitation* or concentrating on a spell, the magic of *prestidigitation* is always keeping you, your clothes, and your gear sparkling clean.

The following effects are added to the list of options you can choose when you cast *prestidigitation*.

* You transmute a small piece of string in your hands into a sturdy, 30-foot-long rope. For the duration, it functions as a regular hempen rope.
* Using the heads side of a coin like a lens, you can hold the coin over one of your closed eyes and see through it. While looking through the coin in this way, you gain darkvision to a range of 30 feet. The coin�s darkvision effect ends when the spell ends.
* A pebble you touch becomes a sensor that you can use to see through. For the duration as long as you are within 10 feet of the pebble, you can use an action to see through the pebble to a range of 30 feet. While seeing through the pebble, you are blinded and deafened with regard to your own senses.
* On a piece of parchment or paper, you can create an exact copy of another piece of parchment or paper, including any writing, drawings, or other markings that appear on the original. The paper does not change size to accommodate any differences in size between the two. The copy you create disappears when the spell�s duration ends.

## Wizard Archetypes

##### Arcanist

Scholarly Specialty

When you take this archetype at 2nd level, choose one classical school of magic as your Scholarly Specialty: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. The gold and time you must spend to copy spells from this school into your spellbook is halved. If a feature refers to your chosen school, it refers to the school selected in this feature.

Flash of Insight

You can use a bonus action to roll a d20, record the result, and choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. The next time that creature makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it takes that d20 result instead of rolling. If you use this feature again before you finish a short rest, you must expend a spell slot of

1st-level or higher to do so.

Refined Learning

At 6th level, choose one of the following benefits:

Arcane Armor

When you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you store some of its magic to protect yourself, gaining temporary hit points equal to twice the level of the spell, or three times the spell�s level if the spell is from your chosen school. Instead of gaining these temporary hit points yourself, you can use your reaction to grant them to a creature you can see within 30 feet.

Energy Retention

When you expend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, you regain one expended spell slot. The regained spell slot must be of a level no more than half the level of the expended spell slot.

War Magic

When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school that deals damage, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) on the first damage roll for that spell.

Superior Talent

At 10th level, choose one of the following benefits:

Perfect Control

When concentrating on a wizard spell of your chosen school, you only need to roll to maintain concentration when you take damage from an attack, effect, or spell equal to or greater than your Intelligence score + your wizard level.

Secondary Learning

Choose a second school as your Scholarly Specialty and an additional

feature from either Esoteric Talent or Refined Learning.

Splinter Spell

Once per rest, when you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school that only affects one creature, you can choose to affect an additional creature within range.

Specialized Mastery

At 14th level, choose one of the following benefits:

Battle Hardiness

When concentrating on a wizard spell from your chosen school, you reduce bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take by an amount equal to the level of the spell.

Heightened Potency

When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, it is always treated as though it were cast with a spell slot one level higher (maximum 9th-level) than the one you used, so long as you expended a spell slot to cast it. The slot you use to cast the spell must still be at least equal to the level of the spell.

Precise Understanding

When you see a creature cast a spell from your chosen school, you automatically know what spell it�s casting. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.

##### Mage

Broad Knowledge

At 2nd level when you choose this archetype, the cost to copy a spell into your spellbook is reduced to 40 gp per spell level (instead of 50 gp per level).

Flexible Thinking

Also at 2nd level, once per rest you can use an action to replace one spell you have prepared with any other spell in your spellbook.

Flux

At 6th level, you gain Flux, the ability to bend your magic in flexible,

constantly-changing ways. When you finish a rest, choose one of the benefits from the following list. You can expend your Flux to use that benefit.

When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can change your benefit to a different one. If you do, you regain your Flux. Otherwise you regain your Flux when you finish a rest.

**Ad Hoc Defense.** When you take damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Elusive.** You can use a bonus action up to teleport 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

**Reactive Ward.** When you make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the result (minimum +1). You can do so after the roll is made, but before any of its effects are resolved.

**Spell Intensity.** When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can increase the spell�s first damage roll by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).

Fluent Control

At 10th level, you can use your Flexible Thinking feature as a bonus action (instead of as an action).

In addition, you add your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells.

Multitalented

At 14th level, when you see a creature cast a spell of a level equal to or lower than your Intelligence modifier, you automatically know what spell it is.

In addition, choose one Flux effect. You can use the chosen effect without expending your Flux. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace the chosen effect with a different Flux effect.

##### Pyromancer

Cleansing Fire

When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you learn how to use flame to heal aw well as harm. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals fire damage, you can choose one creature that would take damage from the spell. Instead of taking damage from the spell, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to the spell�s level plus your proficiency bonus.

Rituals of Fire

Also at 2nd level, you can spend 10 minutes meditating while staring into a flame that fills at least a 5-foot cube to cast *augury* without expending a spell slot.

At 6th level, if you burn an object with a connection to a creature and spend 10 minutes in meditation, you can cast *locate creature* without expending a spell slot.

At 10th level, once per rest, you can step into a fire large enough to fully contain you and cast *dream* without expending a spell slot. When you cast *dream* in this way, you act as the spell�s messenger. You take no damage from the fire, but if the fire goes out before you end the spell, you take 4d6 psychic damage and the spell ends.

Clinging Flames

At 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals fire damage and forces a saving throw, creatures that fail their first saving

throw against it take ongoing fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). At the start of each of its turns, the creature repeats the saving throw, ending the ongoing fire damage on a success.

Blazing Mastery

At 10th level, fire damage from your spells treats immunity to fire damage as though it were fire resistance, and ignores fire resistance entirely. Additionally, you gain resistance to fire damage, as well as immunity to fire damage dealt by your own spells.

Offerings in Kind

At 14th level, you can seek the aid of higher powers in your time of need. As an action, you urge the spirits of fire to intervene and roll 1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than your wizard level, the intervention comes immediately. If not, the spirits make a demand in turn (which may be a high price) and do not intervene until the price is paid. The Narrator determines the price, as well as the exact nature of the intervention, though a wizard spell of any level is usually appropriate. If intervention occurs, this feature can�t be used again for 7 days.

Otherwise, you can try again after a long rest. The scope of this power is dependent on the Narrator�s discretion�for a high enough price, anything is possible.

In addition, you can copy any fire spell into your spellbook as if it were a wizard spell.

Once you do, it is a wizard spell for you.

# Equipment

##### Starting Equipment

Choices made during character creation provide a list of default gear, but there is also the option to forgo this standard list and select items that you feel better fit your character. Choose your class from the table below and spend the allotted amount of gold on equipment.

**TABLE: STARTING GOLD PER CLASS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **CLASS** | **FUNDS** |
| Adept | 30 gp |
| Bard | 135 gp |
| Berserker | 120 gp |
| Cleric | 125 gp |
| Druid | 115 gp |
| Fighter | 140 gp |
| Herald | 200 gp |
| Marshal | 200 gp |
| Ranger | 150 gp |
| Rogue | 125 gp |
| Sorcerer | 100 gp |
| Warlock | 110 gp |
| Wizard | 100 gp |

##### Trading

While gold pieces and other coinage are used to describe the value of items, they are not the only way wealth manifests itself in the world. Gems, information, services, and exchanged goods are useful ways for the average person to acquire what they need. Working people of every stripe may find it

easier to barter day-to-day, and many local governments accept taxes in valuable items that meet the amount due�whether that be poultry or fine wines. The wealthy may trade in the same way, albeit on a grander scale such as with deeds, parcels of land, or full bars of precious metal.

##### Currency

The average day�s wage for a skilled artisan such as a tailor, carpenter, or armorer is a single gold piece.

One gold piece is equivalent to 10 silver pieces. A silver piece is half a day�s wages for an unskilled laborer.

One silver piece is equivalent to 10 copper pieces, the most common coinage amongst the lower-paid working class.

Other coins of less common metals may be found while traveling. Electrum and platinum are not unheard of, but may not spend easily. Cautious merchants may avoid unfamiliar currency to avoid being duped by a forgery.

On average, 50 coins of any value weigh 1 pound.

##### Trading Valuables

Used Weapons, Armor, and Equipment

Used equipment in good working order will usually sell, but it may be worth half (or even less) than a new item. This is not a hard-and-fast situation, and vendors may be swayed into offering more�how your character persuades someone to do that is up to them.

**TABLE: EXCHANGE RATES AND RELATIVE VALUE**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CURRENCY** | **COPPER PIECE** | **SILVER PIECE** | **ELECTRUM PIECE** | **GOLD PIECE** | **PLATINUM PIECE** |
| Copper | 1 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1,000 |
| Silver | 10 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/100 |
| Electrum | 50 | 5 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/20 |
| Gold | 100 | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1/10 |
| Platinum | 1,000 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 1 |
| Common Goods | Soap | One sheet of parchment | One day of rations (1 Supply) | Bedroll | A bottle of ink |

Magic Items

The ease of selling magic items differs from place to place. If in a region where magic is commonplace, selling these items is relatively straightforward. In regions where magic is rare, vendors may not believe the item is genuine, let alone be willing to buy it. If they can be sold, magic items are valuable and often cost more gold than the average person would see in a lifetime.

Treasure and Art

Items such as gems, precious metals, jewelry, and art are valuable because they are sought after across the world. For this reason they rarely diminish in price and may even gain value as time goes by. Lost relics or pieces by master crafters are especially likely to bring in vast amounts of gold, despite their lack of magical or practical utility.

Basic Trade Goods

Trade goods such as grain, salt, and domesticated beasts are sought after everywhere and so are unlikely to diminish much in value from place to place.

**TABLE: TRADE GOODS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **COST** | **GOODS** |
| 1 cp | 1 lb. of wheat |
| 2 cp | 1 lb. of flour |
| 5 cp | 1 lb. of salt |
| 1 sp | 1 lb. of iron |
| 5 sp | 1 lb. of copper |
| 1 gp | 1 lb. of ginger |
| 2 gp | 1 lb. of pepper |
| 3 gp | 1 lb. of cloves |
| 5 gp | 1 lb. of silver |
| 10 gp | 1 cow |
| 15 gp | 1 lb. of saffron |
| 50 gp | 1 lb. of gold |
| 500 gp | 1 lb. of platinum |
| 100 gp | 1 lb. of cold iron |
| 750 gp | 1 lb. of mithral |
| 1,000 gp | 1 lb. of adamantine |

## Armor, Shields, and Weaponry

##### Weapons

You gain proficiency with certain weapons depending on your class, heritage, and other features. Different weapons deal different amounts of damage, have different properties, and can be used to attack from different ranges. Melee weapons are held or thrown, while ranged weapons propel ammunition great distances. When making an attack with a weapon, you add either your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the roll, depending on the weapon�s type, as well as your proficiency bonus, if applicable.

**Simple Weapons.** All NPC humanoids are proficient with simple weapons, and adventurers are able to wield most of them (if not all). The list of simple melee weapons include the club, dagger, handaxe, greatclub, mace, quarterstaff, sickle, and spear, and simple ranged weapons include the blowgun, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and sling.

In addition to being noted in its properties, a simple weapon is also marked with **S**.

**Martial Weapons.** Martial weapons are more complicated to use and require training to be proficient with. You must be proficient with a weapon to gain your proficiency bonus on attack rolls made with it. Unless noted otherwise, weapons are considered martial weapons.

**Rare Weapons.** Unless a trait or feature grants it, you can only gain proficiency with a rare weapon by training during downtime. Depending on the campaign

setting and at the Narrator�s discretion, some rare weapons may be considered martial weapons or they may not exist at all.

##### Weapon Attacks

All creatures are proficient with their natural weapons and unarmed strikes. Unless otherwise noted, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + Strength modifier. Attacks made with natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered to be melee weapon attacks, and a thrown weapon is considered to be a ranged weapon attack. Creatures have a reach of 5 feet with their melee weapon attacks, though larger creatures may have greater reach.

Melee Weapons

Adventurers use a wide variety of weapons in hand-to-hand combat. The table below indicates some of the most common melee weaponry, though different cultures name weapons differently, and some weapons are completely unique (see Cultural Weapons). If you want to use a weapon not listed here, see Customizing Armaments. A melee weapon uses your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls.

Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons require ammunition to use. If you use a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, it is treated as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to be used in this way. A ranged weapon uses your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls.

Weapon Properties

All weapons may deal the same basic types of damage, but they also have special properties that make each unique. You can only benefit from properties marked with � if you are proficient with the weapon.

**Breaker.** This weapon deals double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parentheses after this property.

**Compounding�.** You can only use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Defensive�.** This weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.

**Dual-Wielding�.** This weapon is designed to be wielded in concert with another weapon. When wielding another weapon in your main hand that does not have the heavy property, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with this weapon.

**Finesse.** You may choose to use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Hand-Mounted�.** This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage on saving throws made to resist being disarmed. You can�t use a hand that is wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket, using thieves� tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen components.

**Heavy**. A small creature has disadvantage on attack rolls made with this weapon.

**Loading**. This weapon must be loaded before it can be used. You can only make one attack with a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, even if you can normally make more attacks.

**Mounted�.** This weapon deals the damage listed in parentheses when you are wielding it while mounted.

**Parrying�.** When you are wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated, paralyzed, rattled, restrained, or stunned.

**Parrying Immunity**. Attacks with this weapon ignore the parrying property and Armor Class bonuses from shields.

**Range**. This weapon fires ammunition. The range lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet�the first is the weapon�s normal range, and the second is the weapon�s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon�s normal range, and

you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon�s maximum range.

**Reach**. This weapon can be used to make attacks against targets within 10 feet. If a weapon has a longer reach, it is stated in parentheses after this property.

**Simple**. This weapon can be used with very little skill or training, and all creatures gain proficiency with it.

**Thrown.** This weapon can be thrown as a ranged weapon attack. The thrown property lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet�the first is the weapon�s normal thrown range, and the second is the weapon�s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon�s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon�s maximum range. Additionally, when using this weapon to make a ranged weapon attack, you may choose to use your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage roll.

**Trip�.** When used with a combat maneuver that trips a creature or the Knockdown maneuver, this weapon increases your Maneuver DC by 1. If the target is mounted, your Maneuver DC is instead increased by 2.

**Two-Handed**. You must use two hands to wield this weapon.

**Versatile**. This weapon can be wielded with one or both hands. If wielded with both hands, it deals the damage listed in parentheses.

**Vicious.** A vicious weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17�20).

Improvised Weapons

At the Narrator�s discretion, an improvised weapon that is similar to a weapon with the simple property may be treated as a simple weapon. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type determined by the Narrator. Improvised thrown weapons have a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet.

**TABLE: AMMUNITION**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AMMUNITION** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** |
| Arrows (20) | 1 gp | 1 lb. |
| Blowgun needles (50) | 1 gp | 1 lb. |
| Crossbow bolts (20) | 1 gp | 1 � lbs. |

| Punching arrows (4) | 100 gp | 1 lb. |
| Sling bullets (20) | 4 cp | 1 � lbs. |

Ammunition

Ranged weapons require ammunition to fire. Typically that ammunition is made from bone, bronze, iron, steel, or wood; sling pellets are usually stone or metal. However at the Narrator�s discretion, special ammunition may be available.

**Explosive.** An attack made with explosive ammunition cannot benefit from expertise dice and can only hit targets within its normal range, but on a hit it deals an extra 1d6 thunder damage.

**Flaming.** This ammunition can be lit as a bonus action. A weapon firing this ammunition can only hit targets within its normal range, but on a hit it deals an extra 1d4 fire damage.

**Punching.** On a critical hit, this ammunition decreases an armored target�s Armor Class by 1. This cannot reduce the target�s Armor Class to less than 10 + its Dexterity modifier.

Cultural Weapons

Many weapons have equivalents in various cultures, both in the real world and in fantasy campaign settings. Below is a selection of weapons from different cultures you may choose to include in your game.

Availability of these weapons is at the discretion of the Narrator.

**Boomerang (Aboriginal, 5 sp).** There are many forms of boomerang. This club has the thrown property (range 100/300) and cannot be used as a melee weapon. A boomerang designed to flush out or distract prey flies a shorter distance (range 50/150), but on a miss it returns to the space it was thrown from at the end of the turn.

**Butterfly Sword (Chinese, 20 gp).** These use the statistics of shortswords and are usually wielded in pairs. They have the dual-wielding property.

**Chakram (Indian, 2 gp).** This circular, bladed throwing weapon uses the statistics of a ring blade.

**Claymore (Scottish, 50 gp).** This cross-hilted weapon uses the statistics of a greatsword.

**Dao (Chinese, 20 gp).** A curved broadsword that uses the statistics of a scimitar.

**Hooked Hammer (Gnomish, 15 gp).** This uses the statistics of a small warhammer that does 1d6 bludgeoning or

piercing damage and has the trip property.

**Katana (Japanese, 60 gp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a fine bastard sword.

**Khopesh (Egyptian, 1 gp).** This

sickle-shaped sword uses the statistics of a scimitar.

**Kusarigama (Japanese, 10 gp).** This is a sickle on a chain. It uses the statistics of a sickle that weighs 5 pounds and has the dual-wielding, parrying immunity, reach (10 ft.), and two-handed properties.

**Labrys (Greek, 10 gp).** This ornate weapon uses the statistics of a battleaxe. It has two blades, one on each side of the haft.

**Machahuitl (Aztec, 30 gp).** This club with embedded obsidian blades functions as a fine longsword.

**Main-Gauche (European, 4 gp).** This parrying dagger may be used as a dagger or as a light shield.

**Nine-Section Whip (Chinese, 15 gp).**

This whip deals 1d6 slashing damage.

**Ninjato (Japanese, 20 gp).** This uses the statistics of a straight-bladed shortsword with the storage property (often used to contain poison).

**Nunchaku (Okinawan, 1 gp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a club but is considered a double weapon.

**Rungu (Zambian, 3 sp).** This club has the thrown property (range 30/150).

**Shuriken (Japanese, 3 sp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a throwing dagger. It deals only 1 damage if used in melee. It has the quickdraw property.

**Slingstaff (Halfling, 1 gp).** This weapon can be used as a quarterstaff or as a sling.

**Spiked Gauntlets (Any, 8 gp).** Spiked gauntlets function as brass knuckles but deal piercing damage.

**Stonebow (Dwarven, 25 gp).** This weapon functions as a shortbow, but fires sling bullets that inflict bludgeoning damage.

**Tessen (Japanese, 5 gp).** This war fan can be used as a light shield and as a dagger, and has the flamboyant property.

**Thinblade (Elven, 50 gp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a rapier but is so sharp that it has the vicious property.

**Tomahawk (Native American, 5 gp).** A tomahawk uses the statistics of a handaxe.

**Urgosh (Dwarven, 20 gp).** This spear-and-axe double weapon can be used as either.

**Wakizashi (Japanese, 15 gp).** This blade uses the statistics of a shortsword.

**Wooden Stake (Any, 0 gp).** This simple weapon uses the statistics of a dagger, but any vampire reduced to 0 hit points with it is permanently destroyed. It is made of wood.

Rare Melee Weapons

Most rare melee weapons are secretive, meant to be concealed or utilize a hidden advantage to take foes by surprise.

**Assassin�s Gauntlet/Boot Dagger.** At a glance this item seems to be perfectly typical, but it conceals a spring-loaded blade deployed by pressing a switch when it is used to make an attack. A creature observing it only realizes that the item is a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the weapon is being worn at the time and not deployed). Once deployed, a bonus action is required to resheathe the blade. You gain an expertise die on your attack roll when you deploy this weapon as part of an attack against a target that is unaware you have it.

**Double Weapon.** Wielded not unlike a quarterstaff, each side of this weapon has a blade, weighted head, or other injurious implement. Most double weapons are

two-bladed swords or double-axes, but there have been gnome warriors known to wield hooked hammers and elvish clades specialized in swordspears.

Double weapons use the statistics for whichever weapon is used to attack and are considered to have the dual-wielding and parrying properties.

**Mercurial Maul.** The liquid metal inside of the shaft and head of this weapon makes it difficult to wield but all the deadlier in expert hands. The minimum result on a damage die rolled with this weapon is a 2.

**Ring Blade.** This metal hoop has sharpened edges that make it deadly whether thrown or used in hand. It costs only 1 exertion point to use the Ricochet combat maneuver with this weapon. In addition, when you throw this weapon, you can make the attack with disadvantage. If you do and the attack hits, the weapon returns to your hand.

**Shields.** At the Narrator�s discretion, shields may be treated as rare weapons to gain proficiency with them for attack rolls.

**Sword Pistol.** When this weapon is used to hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to fire the gun in the handle, gaining a 1d6 expertise die on an immediate ranged weapon attack against the same target.

Rare Ranged Weapons

Ranged rare weapons require ammunition to use, although some firearms can hold multiple bullets at a time.

**Geared Slingshot.** Constructed much like a crossbow, this shoulder-mounted weapon bears a striking resemblance to a miniature catapult. It is typically used to fire hand-sized rocks but any Tiny object can be used as ammunition instead.

**Ratcheting Crossbow.** This crossbow has a large winding wheel affixed to its drawstring. The wheel feeds into extra machinery along the stock that catches and pulls the string back again after it is fired. Winding a ratcheting crossbow for a single bolt requires a bonus action or action, and it can be wound to prepare two bolts. Masterwork ratcheting crossbows can either be constructed to fire up to four bolts or made smaller (with statistics like a hand crossbow).

**Revolver.** When a revolver is loaded, it holds up to 6 bullets. The revolver only needs to be loaded after all of its ammunition has been fired.

**Shotgun.** When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with advantage, the attack becomes a critical hit if both d20 rolls would result in a hit. When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with disadvantage and only one attack roll would result in a hit, you instead deal 1d4 piercing damage (adding no bonuses to damage from ability score modifiers or enchantments).

\**Loading a revolver (which holds 6 bullets) requires an action. A revolver can be used to make one ranged attack per bullet loaded into it.*

##### Shields

Shields can range from a dueler�s fencing buckler to the tower shields of mercenary armies. You may wield two shields, but only gain the defensive benefits of one shield at a time. When it is used to attack, a shield is treated as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

Donning a shield grants you no benefit to Armor Class if you are not proficient with shields, and you can�t take cover behind it, plant it on the ground, or sacrifice it.

A creature one size category larger than the shield was designed for treats it as a shield that is one degree lighter, while a creature one size category smaller treats it as a shield that is one degree heavier. If that would make a light shield lighter or a heavy shield heavier, the shield cannot be used by that creature.

The costs and weights in Table: Shields are for shields made from steel.

**Light**. Light shields increase your Armor Class by 1. You can throw this shield, treating it as an improvised weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Medium**. Medium shields increase your Armor Class by 2.

**Heavy**. Heavy shields increase your Armor Class by 2 and you gain an expertise die on Dexterity saving throws. When you take the Dodge action while wielding a heavy shield, you may instead take cover behind your shield, gaining an expertise die to your Armor Class until the start of your turn. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wielding a heavy shield, and you cannot squeeze through spaces smaller than your size category.

**Tower**. Tower shields share the properties of a heavy shield. These shields cover the entire body and reduce

your Speed by 10 feet. On your turn, you may use an object interaction to plant it in the ground, gaining half cover (+2 bonus to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide) and advantage on saving throws made to resist being shoved or knocked prone while you remain behind it. Unplanting a tower shield requires a bonus action.

Tower shields are bulky items, and count as such even when donned.

Improvised Shields

If you are proficient with shields, you can use an action to pick up a nearby object of your size category or larger to use as a shield. The size of the object determines the degree of shield it becomes: an object your size can be used as a light shield, or an object of one size category larger can be used as a medium shield.

An improvised shield is destroyed when you take a critical hit (it cannot be sacrificed), it cannot be repaired or customized, and it becomes useless after 10 rounds of combat.

Sacrifice Shield

When you are subjected to a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block the attack and sacrifice your shield, turning the critical hit into a regular hit. Afterwards, your shield is broken. If your shield is magical, it instead becomes mundane for 1 hour.

**TABLE: SHIELDS**

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SHIELD** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** | **AC BONUS** |
| Light | 10 gp | 4 lbs. | +1 |
| Medium | 20 gp | 8 lbs. | +2 |
| Heavy | 35 gp | 20 lbs. | +2 |
| Tower | 75 gp | 25 lbs | +2 |

##### Armor

The durability of your armor is a combination of the style of armor and its material. Less durable materials, such as cloth and leather, are comfortable, lightweight, and inexpensive but struggle to turn a hit. Metals may turn a hit more easily, but they require more physical strength to wear and cost more coin. The different styles of armor are outlined below.

While wearing armor you aren�t proficient with, you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws using Strength or Dexterity, and you are unable to cast spells.

**Padded**. Layers of cloth or supple leather are quilted together to create a lightweight tunic and pair of trousers. Padded cloth tunics are worn under breastplates and suits of mail for comfort, and are already counted in their AC.

**Brigandine**. A tunic made of cloth, leather, or hide with small panels of metal, scale, or bone stitched to the interior for extra protection. When the panels are external and overlap closely, the brigandine is termed scale mail.

**Breastplate**. A fitted bone, leather, or metal plate that covers the chest, stomach, and vital organs.

**Mail**. A suit made entirely of metal, though styles can differ greatly. A chain shirt is a shirt woven from small metal rings, while a full set of chain mail (a hauberk) is longer and includes a coiff. Half plate covers most of the body in shaped metal plates but offers minimal leg protection, while full plate covers the

entire body and includes gauntlets, boots, and a helm. Splint mail is similar to half plate but covers the limbs in strips of mail bolted to leather, rather than shaped metal plates.

**Bulky Armor.** Half plate and full plate are bulky, but while worn they do not count against the number of bulky items you can carry at once.

Helms

Helms fit over your head to protect your skull, though in exchange they limit your vision and hearing. No proficiency is required to wear a helm.

**Helm.** This hard leather or metal covering protects the head but not the face, with the exception of a strip over the nose. While wearing this helm you gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being stunned or rattled, and your passive Perception score is reduced by 2.

**Visored Helm.** This helm covers the entirety of the head, including the face; the visor can be moved out of the way of the face as by interacting with an object, in which case the visored helm functions as a standard helm. While wearing a visored helm you gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being charmed, rattled, or stunned, and your passive Perception score is reduced by 5.

Additionally, whenever you take damage from falling, you reduce that damage by 5.

Donning, Doffing, Sizing, and Sleeping in Armor

**TABLE: DONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR**

Shield 1 action 1 action

Armor is typically fitted to its wearer. When you first acquire a set of nonmagical armor, you must make or pay for alterations.

Making the alterations yourself requires tool proficiencies as if you were repairing the armor. If the armor is not appropriately sized to you but is of your size category, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of each day you wear the armor, gaining a level of fatigue on a failure. You can alter armor that is a size category larger

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CATEGORY** | **DON** | **DOFF** |
| Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute |
| Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |

than you are, but you cannot fit into armor that is too small.

It is assumed that cloth armor is worn under breastplates and suits of mail. Aside from cloth, leather, and hide, armor is too runcomfortable for a restful night�s sleep. If you sleep in medium or heavy armor other than hide, you are roughing it. You regain half the usual number of Hit Dice, and if you have any levels of fatigue or strife, neither is reduced upon finishing the long rest.

An armor�s category determines how long it takes to don (put on) or doff (take off) that armor.

**Don.** Your Armor Class is only increased by armor you have fully donned.

**Doff.** If you have help, halve this time.

**TABLE: MATERIALS**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DESCRIPTION** | **WEIGHT** | **COST** | **PROPERTIES** | **REPAIRABILITY** |
| **Adamantine** | | | | |
| As weighty as iron, as flexible as steel, and harder than both, adamantine is the most durable material for weapons and armor, as well as the most expensive. | �1.5 | �4 | Hardy, low-  maintenance (advantage), weighty (+2) | DC 25; smith�s tools, access to a forge |
| **Bone** | | | | |
| Bones can be shaped into points for arrows and spears or tied together, along with shells and scales, to form a durable but high-maintenance armor. Due to its brittleness, bone requires constant repairs and has a short lifespan. | �1/2 | �1/4 | Flaw, lightweight | DC 10; sewing kit  Weapons are not repairable |
| **Bronze** | | | | |
| Bronze is durable but weighty, and tends to be more brittle than steel. | �1.5 | �3/4 | Weighty (+1) | DC 12; smith�s tools |
| **Cloth** | | | | |
| Cloth is the flimsiest of materials but also the lightest. Padded layers can be worn as independent armor or underneath metal armors to increase comfort. | � | � | Comfortable, flaw (piercing), underarmor | DC 5; sewing kit |
| **Cold iron** | | | | |
| Alloys of iron and phosphorus are called cold iron. Cold iron is a semi-magical material that many fey creatures are vulnerable to. | � | x2 | Feybane | DC 20; smith�s tools |
| **Hide** | | | | |

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tanned animal hides offer more protection than cloth, but are still easily punctured by blades and arrows. Leather that is left untreated or with the fur or scales still on is known as hide. | � | � Comfortable, wild | | DC 10; sewing kit |
| **Iron** | | | | |
| Iron is weighty and brittle, typically alloyed with carbon (to form steel). | �1.5 | �1/2 | Rust, weighty (+2)  Iron gear can rust if left unmaintained, particularly after exposure to water. | DC 15; smith�s tools |
| **DESCRIPTION** | **WEIGHT** | **COST** | **PROPERTIES** | **REPAIRABILITY** |
| **Leather** | | | | |
| Tanned animal hides offer more protection than cloth, but are still easily punctured by blades and arrows. | � | � Flaw (piercing) | | DC 10; sewing kit |
| **Mithral** | | | | |
| Lighter than steel, mithral is a prized material for its ability to be worked into light, comfortable, and beautiful armor or weapons. | �1/2 | �3 | High-quality, lightweight,  low-maintenance (advantage) | DC 25; smith�s tools, access to a forge |
| **Silver** | | | | |
| Usually an iron-silver alloy rather than pure silver. |  | �2 | Silvered | DC 20; smith�s tools |
| **Steel** | | | | |
| Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon that is lighter and sturdier than its counterparts, but it requires skill and intense heat to make. Steel is the basis of many sets of armor, including chain, plate, and the metalwork inside brigandine. | � | � Low-maintenance (expertise die) | | DC 15; smith�s tools, access to a forge |
| **Stone** | | | | |
| Hard and heavy. Stone is quite brittle and any object beyond a knapped short blade can be challenging to shape. | �2 | Weapons Fortified, weighty  �1/2 (+2)  Armor �3 | | Not repairable |
| **Wood** | | | | |
| Wood is widely accessible and typically used for weapons. Weapons made of wood tend to be fire-hardened with special oils to increase their durability. | � | � Flaw (armor only) | | DC 15  woodworker�s tools |

##### Fine and Masterwork

Some weapons and armor are crafted with extreme skill, often as the crowning accomplishment of a craftsperson�s life.

These pieces are visually distinctive and cost more than similar items of lower quality. Typically, only masterwork items are enchanted, as flimsier pieces tend to not be able to withstand the magical forces�a fine item can become a magic item of up to uncommon rarity, and a masterwork item can become a magic item of up to any rarity. When purchasing or commissioning a masterwork item, work with the Narrator to determine what it looks like, who made it, and how it could be enchanted in future.

A fine item costs at least 25 gp or full price plus 50 percent, whichever is greater. A masterwork item costs at least 125 gp or full price plus 100 percent, whichever is greater.

An item must be originally created as a fine or masterwork item; it cannot be upgraded to a higher quality level.

##### Customizing Armaments

Many weapons and pieces of armor have slight differences across cultures and are referred to with different names (see Cultural Weapons). If you wish to use a weapon that is functionally similar to one on this table, work with the Narrator to determine how it changes visually. You may also use a combination of the weapon or armor properties and the additional properties listed here to create functionally distinct gear.

As a rule of thumb, weapons should have no more than three properties unless one of those properties is a restriction. Shields and

armor should have no more than two properties.

Particularly skilled craftspeople may be able to include the following properties when crafting standard gear. Typically, such an addition costs a minimum of 50 gp or the full cost of the base item, whichever is higher.

**Camouflaged (Armor Only).** The terrain type for camouflaged armor is chosen when it is crafted. You gain an expertise die on Stealth checks while wearing camouflaged armor crafted for the terrain you are in.

**Flamboyant (Weapons Only).** Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist being distracted by this weapon, and you have advantage on Intimidation or Performance checks made with the use of it.

**Quickdraw (Weapons Only)**. If you would normally only be able to draw one of these weapons on a turn, you can instead draw a number equal to the number of attacks you make.

**Rebounding (Thrown Weapons and Shields Only)**. When you make a ranged attack with this weapon or shield, you can make the attack with disadvantage. If you do and the attack hits, the weapon returns to your hand. Piercing weapons cannot have this trait.

**Spiked (Armor Only).** A creature that begins its turn grappling you takes 1 piercing damage while you are wearing spiked armor.

**Stealthy**. This armor or weapon has been disguised to look like a piece of clothing or other normal item. A creature observing the item only realizes that it is armor or a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with

disadvantage if the armor is being worn at the time or the weapon is sheathed).

**Storage**. This item contains a hidden compartment the size of a small vial. On weapons, this compartment might have a release that allows liquid placed in the compartment, such as poison, to flow out and coat the blade or head. You can use a bonus action to release the liquid stored in a weapon.

Customizing Shields

Some shields have special properties to respond to specific situations.

**Hands-Free (25 gp)**. This shield mounts to your arm, leaving your hand free. You cannot wield a weapon with this hand unless it has the hand-mounted property. Only light shields can be hands-free.

Hands-free shields cannot be thrown.

**Mirrored (50 gp)**. Only shields of fine or masterwork quality can be mirrored. This shield has been polished to a mirror-like finish capable of showing a reflection.

When you would be targeted or affected by a gaze effect, you can use your reaction to cause the effect to instead target either the source of the effect or a creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. While wearing this shield you have disadvantage on Stealth checks.

**Spikes (75 gold)**. Some shields are equipped with spikes. When you use your shield to make an attack, you deal 1d4 piercing damage instead of 1d4 bludgeoning damage. When you use your shield to shove or knock someone prone, but would not normally deal damage, you also deal 1d4 piercing damage on a success. Only light or medium shields can be spiked in this way.

##### Maintenance

Like all gear, mundane weapons and armor wear out over time, and keeping them in good working order requires maintenance and repair. Regular day-to-day maintenance is assumed�your bowstring is oiled, your blade is sharpened, and your armor is polished. However, adventurers frequently encounter unusual events that are exceptionally hard on gear. In that case, the Narrator can call for a DC 10 maintenance check (or DC 15 if the stress was particularly severe). If you are proficient with the tools required to repair your gear (as listed in Table: Materials), add your proficiency bonus to the check. On a success, the gear is restored to full working order. On a failure or until the roll is made successfully, the gear is damaged.

**Damaged.** An action is required to draw a damaged weapon or prepare a damaged spellcasting focus. Travel pace is halved for a damaged vehicle.

Some examples of when the Narrator may call for a maintenance check include:

* After the party traverses difficult terrain, such as mud or water.
* After the party has a particularly messy combat encounter.
* After a party member fails a check that could result in damage to gear (like failing an Athletics check to climb and taking falling damage).
* After a party member drops to 0 hit points (with one check per instance, if applicable).
* After a party member is swallowed by a creature.

When you fail a maintenance check and your gear is already damaged, it becomes broken and cannot be used with its full effectiveness until repaired.

**Broken.** A broken item is also damaged. A broken weapon deals half damage. The bonus to Armor Class granted by broken armor and broken shields is halved (minimum 1). The bonus to Armor Class granted by armor equals its AC � 10.

Repairing damaged or broken gear requires a tool check against the DC listed for the gear�s material. You can make one check to repair gear per short or long rest, or you can hire someone to repair the gear for you (which is an automatic success).

The typical cost for hiring out the repair of broken or damaged gear is equal to 1/5th the item�s cost.

##### Material Properties

The materials a weapon or suit of armor is made from determines how best it protects the adventurer using it, as well as how it needs to be maintained.

**Comfortable.** Armor with this property is comfortable enough to sleep in without penalty.

**Feybane.** When using a feybane weapon, you have advantage on attacks made against fey. While you are wearing feybane armor, fey have disadvantage on attacks made against you.

**Flaw.** A weapon with the flaw property breaks when you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll made with it. Armors break when you are subjected to a critical hit or roll a natural 1 on a Dexterity saving

throw. If a damage type is noted in parentheses, the armor only breaks on a critical hit from that damage type, or the weapon only breaks if it does damage of that damage type.

**Fortified.** Fortified armor increases the Armor Class it grants by 1.

**Hardy.** While wearing hardy armor, the first critical hit against you since your last short rest becomes a normal hit. You cannot use this feature again until you make adjustments to the armor during a short or long rest.

**High-Quality.** These weapons and armor are considered one quality level higher (standard becomes fine, and fine becomes masterwork).

**Lightweight.** If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the lightweight version of the armor doesn�t.

**Low-Maintenance.** You gain advantage or an expertise die on maintenance checks made on low-maintenance gear.

**Rust.** When exposed to water and not maintained, this gear cannot be repaired.

**Silvered.** Weapons made from an alloy of silver are considered silvered for the purposes of damage resistances.

**Underarmor.** This armor can be worn under medium and heavy armors.

**Weighty.** The heaviness of some materials results in an increase to the armor�s Strength requirement, if the armor has one. The increase is noted in parentheses.

**Wild.** While wearing wild armor, you cannot gain expertise dice on Deception and Persuasion checks made in urban environments.

## Adventuring Gear

##### Medicinals

Not everyone has access to magical healing spells. The following herbal remedies and potions may be commonly available from apothecaries and herbalists, at the Narrator�s discretion.

Drinking or administering a potion or remedy takes an action.

Expertise dice granted by the use of a medicinal can be gained from that type of medicinal only once between long rests.

**Adderwort Roots.** Chewing these dark roots bolsters your body�s natural defenses, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Constitution saving throws for 1 hour.

**Antitoxin.** Consuming the dark bitter liquid in this vial removes the poisoned condition, and you gain advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour.

**Bandage**. These strips of sterilized cloth stanch bleeding and cover wounds. You can use an action to apply a bandage to yourself or another creature to end ongoing piercing or slashing damage.

When using improvised bandages, there is a 50 percent chance of exposure to a disease.

**Dried Yewclaw Bark.** Eating strips of this dried yellow bark calms and clarifies the mind, and after consuming this bark you gain an expertise die on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour.

**Fairy Cap**. Consuming this small red mushroom cap removes inhibitions and creates confidence, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Charisma saving throws for 1 hour.

**Healer�s Satchel**. This leather pouch contains medical implements used to

patch up wounds. As an action, you can expend one use of this item to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check.

**Healing Potion**. These potions have auras of evocation magic invisible to mundane eyes.

*Basic:* When you drink the bright red liquid in this flask, you regain 2d4 + 2 hit points.

*Greater:* When you drink the pure red concoction in this flask, you regain 4d4

+ 4 hit points.

*Superior:* Requiring rare ingredients, the recipes for these potions are jealously guarded by master herbalists. When you drink the glowing crimson liquid in this vial, you regain 8d4 + 8 hit points.

*Supreme:* Only a few herbalists every generation master the precise artistry required to brew these serums. When you drink the iridescent liquid in this vial you regain 10d4 + 20 hit points.

**Ironwood Acorn**. This tough acorn must be swallowed whole to fortify your muscles and sinews, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Strength saving throws for 1 hour.

**Jar of Leeches.** This jar contains bloodthirsty medicinal worms useful for curing many maladies. You can expend one use of this jar during a short rest to administer leeches to yourself or a willing creature. A creature that has leeches administered to them cannot regain hit points during this short rest due to blood loss, but it may repeat a saving throw to remove the poisoned condition or a blood-borne disease (DC equal to the original effect).

Alternatively, as an action you can throw this jar up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a

creature or object, treating the jar as an improvised weapon. On a hit, if the target is a Large or smaller creature it takes 1d4 ongoing damage. A creature can end this damage by using its action to remove the leeches.

**Laudanum**. This mixture of ambergris, saffron, and other rare ingredients can calm the nerves and ease mental pain. Once between long rests, when you drink the bitter reddish-brown concoction in this vial, you recover a level of strife. Roll 1d10. On a 1, you gain a short-term mental stress effect.

**Lavender Paste.** Mixing lavender petals with herbs creates a natural insect repellent. You can use an action to apply the paste to yourself or a willing creature, granting immunity to insect-based hazards in swampy terrain. In addition, the creature gains benefits equivalent to mosquito netting for the next 24 hours.

**Medicinal Salve.** Made from herbal ingredients, this soothing salve can help mend grievous injuries. You can apply medicinal salve to your wounds or the wounds of a willing creature during a short rest. Once between long rests, a creature treated with medicinal salve rolls a bonus Hit Die and adds the result to the total number of hit points regained during the short rest. (If a creature has multiple types of Hit Dice, use the largest.) When used in combination with a bandage, the bonus Hit Die granted by medicinal salve restores the maximum number of hit points.

**Pressed Spiderbulb.** Consuming this dried flower grants you energy and tightens your reflexes, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Dexterity saving throws for 1 hour.

**Sycamore Petal Poultice.**

Consumption of these pulped petals

heightens your senses, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Wisdom saving throws for 1 hour.

##### Spellcasting Foci

Many spellcasters rely on a magical focus, an item that allows them to channel their power. Using a spellcasting focus allows a spellcaster to forgo many material components for their spells. A wide variety of items can be turned into magical foci, which fall into three primary categories:

* **Arcane Focus:** These foci are soaked in arcane power and often engraved or painted with eldritch symbols and cosmic iconography. Orbs, crystals, grimoires, staves, or wands are often used as spellcasting foci by sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards.
* **Divine Focus:** These foci (often called holy symbols) are representations of a deity, pantheon, or ideal. They usually depict the crest or icon of a specific god or are of symbolic importance to a particular faith. Reliquaries, censers, amulets, emblems, or tattoos are often used as spellcasting foci by clerics and heralds.
* **Nature Focus:** These foci typically incorporate furs, feathers, living plants, sacred wood, or the bones or teeth of sacred animals. Staves, wands, wonders, fetishes, or totems are typically used as spellcasting foci by druids and rangers.

**Focus Tattoo**. Some spellcasters permanently mark their bodies with symbols of their deity, eldritch runes, or ritualistic symbols. You can apply a focus tattoo over the course of a long rest, after which it functions as a spellcasting focus. Focus tattoos draw on a bearer�s own magics and must be attuned like a magic item in order to function. Focus tattoos require an attunement slot. When you cast spells with a focus tattoo in this way, you must briefly touch your focus tattoo with your free hand.

**Grimoire**. These large and imposing tomes can function both as a spellbook and as a spellcasting focus.

**Staff**. In addition to its use as a spellcasting focus, a staff can also be used as a quarterstaff.

**Wonder**. A wonder is an unusual spellcasting focus such as a sacred flower that never wilts, a prismatic crystalized skull, or a polished burl that whispers with the language of the trees. If you lose a wonder, you can replace it as a ritual that takes 10 minutes and requires 5 gp worth of rare materials. You must be able to cast ritual spells to restore a lost wonder in this way. When you do so, any previous wonders created this way are destroyed.

##### Common Poisons

While some poisons require exotic or expensive ingredients, many effective concoctions can be obtained or made with little effort. The following poisons might be commonly available from apothecaries and herbalists, at the Narrator�s discretion.

Applying a poison takes an action. A creature immune to the poisoned condition is immune to any effects from poisons.

**Curare**. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

**Ether**. You can use the chemicals in this flask to soak a rag or other small cloth item. An open flask of ether or an

ether-soaked rag retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with it. While you are grappling a creature, you can use the ether to make a special melee weapon attack against that creature. On a hit, the creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. The creature remains unconscious for 1 minute, until it takes damage, or until another creature uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.

**Poison**. You can use the poison in these vials to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition.

*Basic:* When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it must make a DC 12 Constitution

saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

*Advanced:* When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

*Potent:* When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

##### Survival Gear

The following items are necessities when facing inhospitable environments and harsh journeys:

**Bedroll**. This essential commodity provides insulation and comfortable sleep on rocky, wet, or uneven terrain.

**Blanket**. Provides warmth while resting in cold environments.

**Climbing Gear**. A set of climbing gear includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climbing gear as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can�t fall more than 25

feet from the anchor point, and you can�t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

**Cold Weather Gear**. Cold weather gear includes special boots, gloves, warm padding, and face protection. This gear can be worn over or under any armor and takes 5 minutes to don or remove. While wearing cold weather gear, you automatically succeed on saving throws against effects caused by an environment of extreme cold, but you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects from environments of extreme heat and spells or effects that deal fire damage. This gear can also be worn to provide warmth while resting in cold environments.

**Compass**. This device has a

free-turning needle that always points towards the magnetic north.

**Fishing Trap**. Whenever you retrieve this arrangement of netting, wires, and weights from a body of water with aquatic life, roll a d20 and add a bonus equal to the number of hours the trap has been set. On a 21 or higher, the trap has captured fish or other aquatic animals totaling 1d4 Supply.

**Hunting Snare**. This simple arrangement of stakes, wires, and ropes can be set for catching small game in woodlands, forests, or other hunting grounds. Whenever you retrieve the snare, roll a d20 and add a bonus equal to the number of hours the snare has been set. On a 21 or higher, the snare has captured and killed a Tiny game animal totaling 1d4 Supply.

**Hunting Trap**. ou can set a hunting trap as an action by affixing its chain to an immovable object. If a creature steps on the trap, it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes

2d4 piercing damage and stops moving. Until it escapes, the creature's movement is limited to the length of the trap's chain, which is usually 3 feet long. Freeing the trapped creature requires a DC 13 Strength check. On a failed check, the trapped creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. Hunting traps of higher quality are more complex and effective, increasing the DC of each saving throw and ability check (by 2 for fine hunting traps, or by 4 for masterwork hunting traps).

**Map.** When using a map, you can travel at a fast pace without taking a penalty to your passive Perception while within the area the map depicts. If you use a compass in conjunction with a map, you gain an expertise die on checks made to avoid becoming lost.

*Local:* This map depicts an area that is well known to its makers and includes the names of hamlets, villages, and towns, as well as roads, waterways, and other routes through the realm.

*Distant:* This map depicts a region far-flung from those that made it. It depicts only the major geographical features and best-known routes within the realm.

*Frontier:* This map depicts an area only recently explored by those that made it, and the information is often incorrect or incomplete. When consulting this map, the Narrator secretly rolls a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the outdated or false information wastes travel time, as those using the map only progress half as much distance towards their destination.

**Marshland Gear**. Marshland gear includes special boots, gloves, and clothes designed to repel moisture and muck. This gear can be worn over light

armor and takes 5 minutes to don or remove. While you are wearing marshland gear, you can move at a normal pace through nonmagical swamps and marshes, but you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws made on dry or rocky terrain.

**Mosquito Netting**. This thin mesh cloth offers protection from small insects while sleeping in jungles, swamps, or similar environments.

**Rations**. Rations can vary wildly depending on the culture, but they usually consist of a day�s worth of water and dry foods suitable for extended travel, such as jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, or nuts. One unit of rations provides 1 Supply.

**Tent.** These stitched-together canvases, hides, or tarps offer protection from the elements so long as there is a flat space where they can be deployed.

*One Person:* Suitable for a Medium-sized creature. Occupies a 5-foot by 10-foot space when set up.

*Two Person:* Suitable for up to 2 Medium-sized creatures. Occupies a 10-foot by 10-foot space when set up.

*Communal:* Suitable for up to 6 Medium-sized creatures. Occupies a 15-foot by 15-foot space when set up.

**Torch**. Once lit, a torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. A torch burns for 1 hour. When you use a burning torch as a club to make a melee attack, it deals an extra 1 fire damage on a hit.

**Torch (Alchemical)**. The rough, sticky tar at the end of this torch burns through even the most adverse conditions. An alchemical torch burns for 1 hour even in heavy rains, strong winds, and

underwater (albeit poorly when submerged, shedding only dim light in a 5-foot radius). Dimmer than a normal torch, it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

##### Containers

Table: Containers details the most common types of containers, though many adventurers get by with just a backpack and a waterskin.

##### Miscellaneous Adventuring Gear

The many essentials that make adventuring into the unknown possible include:

**Acid**. You can use an action to splash the contents of this vial onto a target within 5 feet of you, or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged

improvised weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 ongoing acid damage. This damage persists for 3 rounds. A creature ends all ongoing damage from mundane acid by using its action to wipe away the liquid.

**Alchemist�s Fire**. This liquid ignites in air. You can use an action to throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against a target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 ongoing fire damage. This damage persists for 1 minute. A creature can end all ongoing damage being dealt by alchemist�s fire by using its action to

either make a DC 14 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames or by dousing the target with at least 1 gallon of water.

**Ball Bearings**. You can use an action to spill these metal spheres over a level,

10-foot square area. A creature moving through the area at greater than half speed must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failure.

***Black Powder Charge****.* A pound of black powder inside a wooden shell with a fuse can make a simple but potent explosive. You can use an action to set and light one or more black powder charges, which explode at the start of your next turn. A creature or object within 10 feet of an exploding charge must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage and 1d6 fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Increase the explosion�s damage by 1d6 force and 1d6 fire for each doubling of the number of charges set beyond the first. For example, 4 black powder charges deal 3d6 force and 3d6 fire damage, 8 black powder charges deal 4d6 force and 4d6 fire damage, 32 black powder charges deal 6d6 force damage and 6d6 fire damage, and so on.

Multiple charges increase the area of the explosion, as follows: 2 charges�20-foot radius, 4

charges�30-foot radius, 8

charges�40-foot radius, 16

charges�50-foot radius, 32 charges�60-foot radius.

Black powder charges become useless and are destroyed when submerged in water or left exposed to rain.

**Block and Tackle**. This is a set of pulleys attached to a hook, upon which heavy objects can be attached. Along with a length of rope, a block and tackle

allows a creature to lift a weight four times heavier than they normally could.

**Book**. A book might contain fiction, illustrations, or information about any subject. (Spellbooks contain magical spells and are described later.) A book of masterwork quality covers one subject in detail. You gain an expertise die on checks made regarding the specialty detailed in the last masterwork book you�ve read.

***Cage.*** This metal cage can contain a creature of the size it is designed to hold. The cage has a simple door held with a latch that requires an Intelligence score of 5 or higher to open.

*Medium:* The cage (AC 16, 25 hit points) can be burst open with a DC 22 Strength check.

*Large:* The cage (AC 17, 40 hit points) can be burst open with a DC 24 Strength check.

*Huge:* The cage (AC 18, 55 hit points) can be burst open with a DC 26 Strength check.

**Caltrops**. You can use an action to spread these spikes over a level,

5-foot-square area. A creature that moves through the area at greater than half speed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or it stops moving this turn and takes 1d4 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature�s Speed by 10 feet until it regains at least 1 hit point.

**Candle**. A lit candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. It burns for 1 hour.

**Chain**. A chain (AC 16, 10 hit points) can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check.

**Clothes (Any)**. Clothes of varying styles can be appropriate to any number of cultures or social situations and can be

worn over light armor. A DC 14 Perception check is required to notice light armor hidden underneath clothes.

**Component Pouch**. A component pouch is a belt pouch containing those spellcasting material components that don�t have an explicit cost.

**Crowbar**. You have advantage on Strength checks made to force open doors and similar objects when you apply leverage with this hooked metal bar.

**Eyepatch**. Eyepatches can be used to prepare one eye for lower-light conditions, such as when moving between the deck and relative darkness of a ship�s hold.

When you are wearing an eyepatch and enter an area of darkness or dim light from a brightly lit area, you can use a bonus action to swap the patch from one eye to the other to gain an expertise die on Perception checks for the next 10 minutes or until you enter an area of bright light.

**Fishing Tackle**. Fishing tackle typically includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.

**Flash Bomb**. You can use an action to throw this glass bauble, making a ranged improvised weapon attack against a creature within 20 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded until the end of your next turn.

**Holy Water**. You can use an action to splash the contents of this flask on a creature within 5 feet of you, or throw the flask up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against a creature. On a hit, a fiend or undead takes 2d6 radiant damage and becomes slowed until the end of your next turn.

A cleric or herald can create holy water by performing a 1-hour ritual that costs 1

25 gp and the expenditure of a 1st-level spell slot.

**Hook Hand**. Prosthetic hook hands are common replacements for missing hands. You cannot gain advantage or expertise dice on Sleight of Hand checks made with a hook hand. A hook is a natural weapon that you can use to make unarmed strikes, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.

**Lantern**. A lantern can burn for 6 hours on a pint flask of oil.

*Standard:* Casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

*Bullseye:* Casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

*Hooded:* Casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can use an action to lower the hood, causing the lantern to instead cast dim light in a 5-foot radius.

**Lock**. A creature without the lock�s key (included in the price) can pick the lock with a DC 15 thieves� tools check. At the Narrator�s discretion, better, more expensive locks may exist.

**Magnifying Glass**. When you use a magnifying glass, you gain an expertise die on ability checks to inspect an item that is Tiny or highly detailed. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires 5 minutes, tinder, and sunlight or similar light.

**Manacles**. These metal cuffs (AC 16, 20 hit points) can restrain a Small or Medium creature. As an action, you can use the manacles to restrain an unwilling creature, which must either be restrained or both grappled and prone. Escaping the manacles requires a DC 20 Dexterity check, and breaking them requires a DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles

comes with one key. Without the key, a creature can pick the lock with a DC 15 thieves� tools check.

**Merchant�s Scale**. This balance scale measures the exact weight of Tiny objects.

**Mess Tin**. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan while the other is used as a plate or shallow bowl.

**Oil**. You can use an action to throw a

1. pint flask of oil up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target is soaked in oil. The next time the creature takes fire damage in the next minute, it takes an extra 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on a level, 5-foot-square area and set it alight. The oil burns for 2 rounds, dealing 5 fire damage to a creature the first time on a turn that it enters the area or ends its turn there.

**Paint Pot**. This small clay pot contains a pint of a single color of paint, enough to cover about 50 square feet. As an action, you can throw the paint pot up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target is covered in bright paint.

Removing the paint requires at least 1 minute of vigorous scrubbing. While covered in paint, a creature has disadvantage on Stealth checks.

**Portable Ram**. While using a portable ram, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks made to break down doors. When another creature helps you use the ram, you gain an expertise die (as well as advantage, as normal).

**Prosthetic**. Prosthetics are usually metal and custom made to replace whatever portion of a limb has been lost.

*Arm or Hand:* You cannot gain advantage or expertise dice on Sleight of Hand checks made with this prosthetic. However, you can use the prosthetic defensively, treating it as a hands-free light shield when not holding a weapon or object in that hand.

*Leg or Foot:* While you are standing on your prosthetic, you cannot gain advantage or expertise dice on saving throws made to resist being knocked prone, but you take half damage from caltrops, spikes, and difficult terrain that deals damage. Depending on how your prosthetic is constructed, you can use it to store up to one concealed Tiny item (DC 15 Investigation or Perception check to notice).

**Rope**. Hemp or silk rope has an AC of 10, 2 hit points, and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

**Smoke Bomb**. This metal sphere�s casing is pockmarked with holes and capped with a thick fuse. As an action, you can light the bomb�s fuse and throw the bomb up to 20 feet. While lit, the bomb spews suffocating black smoke that heavily obscures a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. An air-breathing creature that starts its turn within the smoke must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage until it leaves the area. A wind of at least moderate speed suppresses the smoke effect for 1 round.

**Spellbook**. A spellbook is a 100-page book in which wizards scribe their spells. **Spyglass**. Anything viewed through a spyglass appears to be twice its normal

size. You can use a spyglass to make Perception checks to observe areas you can see that are more than a quarter mile away.

**Tanglefoot Bag*.*** Unguents and adhesives fill this airtight sack. You can use an action to throw this bag, making a ranged improvised weapon attack at a target within 20 feet. On a hit, rapidly hardening sap covers the target. and it makes a DC 13 Strength check or becomes grappled. At the start of each of its turns, the target repeats the check, ending the effect on itself on a success. The sap can also be destroyed (AC 13, 6 hit points).

**Tinderbox**. This box holds everything needed to start a fire, including flint, fire steel, and tinder. You can use a tinderbox to ignite wood in 1 minute, or a torch, paper, tinder, or other very flammable object in one action.

**Travel Enclosure**. This fine, wire-mesh bag is reinforced with metal beams, making a durable but flexible enclosure. Creatures of an appropriate size can comfortably reside within the enclosure if provided with some appropriate substrate (soft bedding for rodents, loamy soil for toads, and so on).

*Tiny:* A single Tiny creature residing within the enclosure has total cover while inside it and automatically succeeds on saving throws to resist area effects.

*Small:* Up to 3 Tiny creatures or a single Small creature residing with the enclosure have total cover while inside it and automatically succeed on saving throws to resist area effects.

**Unstable Arcanum (Vial)**. This small vial of unstable magical waste can make for a powerful explosive. You can set and light one or more vials of unstable arcanum as an action, causing each to explode at the start of your next turn. A creature or object within 10 feet of the

exploding vial must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 force damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Increase this damage by 2d10 for each vial set beyond the first.

Whenever a creature carrying unstable arcanum takes damage from a spell or cantrip, it must roll a d4. On a result of a 1, the unstable arcanum instantly explodes as if set and lit.

**Wheelchair**. This durable device provides tactical mobility without requiring use of the legs. While mounted on a wheelchair you are considered to be wearing the wheelchair as a piece of gear. The wheelchair is mechanically complex and can ascend stairs and ramps slowly, or provide a boost of speed on the descent. You have a movement speed of 30 feet while mounted on a wheelchair. You treat inclines and stairs as difficult terrain, but while moving down slopes, stairs, or other significant declines you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. At the Narrator�s discretion, more advanced and tactical wheelchairs may be available.

***Bulky.*** A bulky item weighs 40 pounds or more (for example a bag with 2,000 or more gold coins) or is greater than 4 feet in any dimension (like a large ornate rug). A creature can carry one bulky item, plus additional bulky items equal to its Strength modifier (minimum 1). When a creature is not carrying any Supply, it can carry one additional bulky item.

***Carrying Things.*** A Medium-sized creature�s carrying capacity equals its Strength score � 15 pounds. Aside from its gear, a Medium-sized creature can carry Supply equal to its Strength score.

##### Tools

Many trades and crafts require special tools to do things like pick a lock, paint a portrait, or brew a potion.

Any character can use a tool kit, but many characters also gain proficiency with specific tools. When you are proficient, you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks made with that tool.

Tool use does not depend on any single ability score, and your Narrator may decide your work might require any sort of ability check.

**Masterwork Tools*.*** When using tools of masterwork quality that you are proficient with, you gain an expertise die on checks made with them.

Trade Tools

Trade tools are divided into artisan�s tools, gaming sets, and musical instruments.

**Artisan�s Tools.** These tools allow you to turn a specific type of raw material into generic trade goods using your time, effort, and skill. The type of tool determines the materials and amount of time needed. After spending the needed time and materials, you make a profession check with those tools, which determines the value of the resulting generic trade goods (on a result of 15 or lower, the materials used are wasted).

**Gaming Sets**. These items can be played to simply pass the time or to win money through gambling. Gambling can potentially earn or lose money, depending on the amount you wager and the outcome of your check. You can also attempt to cheat opponents by making a Sleight of Hand check contested by the highest Perception check among observers. On a success, you gain advantage on your ability check using the gaming set, but on a failure your opponents might turn hostile. Not all opponents can cover all wagers, and most refuse to wager for more than a quarter of their net worth. For each hour spent gambling, make a check using your tool set and consult Table: Gambling Outcomes (though in most situations, there�s only so much money to be won, and usually a few sore losers when the house is cleaned out).

**Musical Instrument.** Examples of some common types of musical instruments are found on Table: Musical Instruments, but any instrument can be played for coin.

Doing so requires a public space with at least 10 people, or an official gig at an establishment with a musical venue, like a tavern or club. In either case, make a

check using your instrument for each hour you spend performing, then consult Table: Performance Outcomes to determine the amount of gold you receive, though you may earn more or less at specific musical venues at the Narrator�s discretion. Bards can also use musical instruments as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

Miscellaneous Tools

The following tools allow you to perform specific actions or have very specific uses.

**Disguise Kit.** A creature observing you after you make a disguise kit check must make a Perception check against a DC equal to the result of your disguise kit check in order to see through your disguise.

**Forgery Kit.** A creature examining a false document made using a forgery kit must make an Investigation check against a DC equal to the result of your forgery kit check in order to realize it is a fake.

**Herbalism Kit.** This kit contains the tools needed to carefully harvest and process rare herbs into remedies. You can attempt to harvest rare herbs from areas with abundant flora by spending an hour searching and making an herbalism kit check. You randomly obtain one of the following medicinals on a result of 16�22: adderwort roots, dried yewclaw bark, fairy cap, ironwood acorn, pressed spiderbulb, sycamore petal poultice. On a result of 23�27, you instead obtain one rare herb, and on a result of 28 or higher you obtain 2 rare herbs. With 1 minute of preparation a rare herb can be quickly processed into a *basic healing potion*, 2 rare herbs can be made into an antitoxin, and 3 rare herbs can be made into a *greater healing potion*.

**Navigator�s Tools.** These precision instruments allow you to relate your position to the position of the stars. So long as you are on the Material Plane and can freely observe the stars, once per night you can make a navigator�s tools check. On a result of 15�19, you learn one of the following pieces of information, or two pieces of information on a result of 20 or higher:

* The approximate time of year.
* Your approximate distance from the equator (assuming the world has a known axis).
* Your approximate distance from the place you last made this check.
* Your current distance from a major landmark and the approximate amount of time it will take to reach it.

***Poisoner�s Kit.*** Everything necessary for carefully harvesting and processing natural poisons and venoms can be found in this kit. You can attempt to harvest poisons from areas with abundant flora by spending an hour searching and making a poisoner�s kit check. On a result of 1�14, you accidentally poison yourself and suffer the effects of a basic poison. On a result of 15�19, you obtain a vial�s worth of basic poison. On a result of 20�24, you obtain a vial�s worth of advanced poison, and on a result of 25 or higher you obtain a vial�s worth of potent poison.

Alternatively, with 10 minutes of work you can use a poisoner�s kit to harvest poison from the fresh corpse of a creature that naturally contained poisons. Make a poisoner�s kit check against a DC equal to the DC of the creature�s poison (if the creature�s poison has no saving throw, use 8 + the creature�s CR). On a failed

check, you suffer the effects of the creature�s poison, and on a success you harvest a vial�s worth of poison. As an action, you can use the creature�s poison to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to 3 pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. Weapons or ammunition you coat in a creature�s poison inflict the same effects as shown in the creature�s statistics. Once you harvest poison from a creature, that corpse cannot be harvested again.

**Sewing Kit.** This kit of threads, thimbles, buttons, and scissors is primarily used to mend clothing. With 1 hour of work you can use a sewing kit to mend clothing and some suits of armor. The DC of a sewing kit check is determined by the material being worked (as shown on Table: Materials).

**Smith�s Tools.** These hammers and clamps are a poor replacement for a full forge but can be instrumental for repairing metal items. With 1 hour of work you can use smith�s tools to mend many weapons and armors. The DC of a smith�s tools check is determined by the material being worked (as shown on Table: Materials).

**Thieves� Tools**. This set of often sharp and slender metal instruments are needed to crack locks and carefully spy into mechanisms. You can use an action to open a lock by making a thieves� tools check against a DC determined by the quality of the lock being picked.

##### Mounts

This section concerns the cost, upkeep, and carrying utility of your mounts.

In order to be used as a mount, a creature must be at least one size category larger than you, and must have an Intelligence score of 4 or lower. You may be able to convince creatures with a higher Intelligence score to let you ride them, but they are considered independent creatures (not mounts).

You can use a mount as a pack animal instead of riding it. A pack animal can carry a number of Supply based on its size (see Tracking Supplies) in addition to its normal carrying capacity, and it can carry a number of bulky items equal to its Strength modifier

+ 1. If you intend to ride a mount as well as carry items with it, it can only carry half as many Supply and bulky items.

Many beasts commonly used as pack animals and mounts are especially adept at carrying heavy loads, and animals such as horses and mules have a much higher carrying capacity than their Strength score

would normally provide, as shown on Table: Mounts.

Multiply a creature�s carrying capacity by 5 if that creature is pulling a drawn vehicle.

Creatures can add their carrying capacities together when pulling the same vehicle.

The mounts listed here are available for purchase in most fantasy worlds. Other mounts may be common in your setting or may be rare creatures awarded for the completion of a quest. Many large pets could also be used as mounts.

Feed

Mounts are living creatures, and they need to eat. Thankfully, most common mounts are herbivorous animals able to feed themselves if allowed to graze in grassy areas for at least 1 hour each day. Other mounts�especially carnivorous ones�may not be so easy to feed. Carnivorous mounts and herbivorous mounts without grazing areas must be fed Supply each day, or else they suffer fatigue just like characters.

Medium mounts require 1 Supply each day, Large mounts require 2 Supply each day, and mounts that are Huge size or larger require an amount of Supply determined by the Narrator.

If using the **casual supplies** rules, mounts are assumed to either feed themselves or carry enough feed to last any journey.

If using the **desperate supplies** rules, feed for mounts must be tracked separately. Throughout the course of a day, Large-sized mounts must consume at least 4 pounds of food and 4 gallons (32 pounds) of water.

Huge-sized mounts must consume at least 16 pounds of food and 16 gallons (128 pounds) of water. When a mount finishes a long rest without having consumed its required food and water, it gains a level of fatigue.

Mount Traits

Every mount is different. For each mount, there is a chance of it having a special trait. Roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, roll 1d20 on the following table.

* 1. **Fleet.** The mount is unusually fast. Increase its Speed by 5 feet.
  2. **Loyal.** The mount always comes to you when called or whistled for.
  3. **Aggressive.** Increase the mount�s attack bonuses by 1.
  4. **Skittish.** The first time each encounter the mount or its rider is attacked, roll 1d6. On a 1, the mount panics and flees in a random direction for 1 round.
  5. **Proud.** The mount will carry its rider but refuses to carry bags.
  6. **Kicks.** Unless it is being ridden, the mount attacks anyone that wanders close to it.
  7. **Protective.** Once per long rest, the mount will take a hit for its rider.
  8. **Dislikes barding.** The mount refuses to wear barding of any kind.
  9. **Bestial.** The mount is unusually bestial looking. The rider gains an expertise die on Intimidation checks.
  10. **Unusual color.** The mount is an unusual color for its species, making it somewhat unique.
  11. **Placid.** The mount is usually docile and friendly, and will not attack foes.
  12. **Devil-touched.** The mount has some devilish blood, given away by its red eyes. It has resistance to fire damage.
  13. **Vertigo.** The mount is afraid of heights. Taking the mount across high places (like a ledge with a 10-foot drop below it) requires coaxing with a DC 10 Animal Handling check.
  14. **Fey-touched.** The mount has some fey blood. It and its rider have advantage on saving throws against enchantment spells.
  15. **Greedy.** The mount chows down on unattended food, and requires double the normal Supply.
  16. **Fearful.** The mount is afraid of fire and will not move within 10 feet of it without a DC 10 Animal Handling check.
  17. **Willing.** The mount is eager to please, and lowers itself to assist when being mounted. Mounting this mount is a free action.
  18. **Jump-shy.** The mount will not attempt jumps of any kind.
  19. **Spirited.** The mount and its rider gain +1 to initiative checks.
  20. **Protective.** The mount can stand watch and alert the party if it detects approaching creatures.

##### Mount Gear

Stabling (per day)

##### Vehicles

5 sp (2 gp for � Huge mounts)

The following items are associated with keeping proper care of a mount.

**Barding**. Barding is armor built for an animal. When purchasing barding, refer to Table: Armor but multiply the cost of the armor by 4 and the weight by 2.

**Saddles**. Saddles make for an easier ride and help prevent the rider from falling off. While using a saddle, you gain an expertise die on any check made to remain mounted. Saddles for particularly unusual creatures are more expensive and cost 5 times the price of a regular saddle.

**Saddlebags**. Saddlebags allow you to pack items onto a creature beside the saddle. A mount can�t carry Supply or bulky items without saddlebags.

**Stabling**. In a city, your mount will need lodging just like you do. The cost found on Table: Mount Gear is the average cost to house and feed a Large or smaller mount for 24 hours at most stables.

Particularly exotic or larger mounts may cost more to stable.

**TABLE: MOUNT GEAR**

All vehicles have the following properties:

* **Terrain:** Vehicles fall into three terrain categories: land vehicles, water vehicles, and air vehicles. Vehicles travel in the terrain of their category. Proficiency with a category of vehicles allows a creature to add its proficiency bonus to checks made with that type of vehicle.
* **Size and Armor Class:** Just like creatures, vehicles have size categories, and each has an AC that determines how difficult it is to hit with attacks.
* **Hit Points:** A vehicle is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. In addition, when a vehicle is reduced to 50 percent of its hit point maximum, it suffers a malfunction and must roll on Table: Malfunction.
* **Speed:** Vehicles are listed with their movement speed, as well as their journey speed for traveling long distances.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ITEM** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** |
| Barding | �4 | �2 |
| Saddle | 10 gp (50 gp  for exotic saddles) | 25 lbs. |
| Saddlebags | 4 gp | 8 lbs. |

* **Crew:** Many vehicles only need a single creature as a driver, but larger vehicles often require dozens of people to properly operate. Drivers cannot perform actions using a vehicle unless the minimum crew requirement is met.
* **Immunities:** As objects, vehicles are immune to poison

and psychic damage. They are also immune to the blinded, charmed, confused, deafened, fatigued, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, slowed, strife, stunned, and unconscious conditions, as well as any other effect that would result from failing a Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throw.

* **Havens:** A vehicle acts as a haven if it provides accommodation and shelter from the elements. At the Narrator�s discretion, the environment may not be suitable for it to act as a haven.

Unlike creatures, all vehicles have a �front.� In many situations this facing dictates the way the vehicle moves.

In order to move, all vehicles require a driver. While at the steering (such as the reins of a wagon or the wheel of a ship) a creature can use a bonus action to make the vehicle perform one of the following actions:

* **Drive:** The vehicle moves half of its movement speed directly forward, then the driver may change the vehicle�s facing by up to 90 degrees (a full turn left or right) before moving up to the remaining movement speed. The vehicle gains momentum.
* **Maneuver:** The vehicle moves half of its movement speed forward, and the driver may change the vehicle�s facing by up to 90 degrees (a full turn left or right) up to 2 times during

this movement. This action cannot be performed while the vehicle has momentum.

* **Ahead Full:** The vehicle moves one and a half times its movement speed directly forward. The vehicle gains momentum. If the vehicle would roll for a malfunction before it is used to take another action, it rolls twice on that table instead (reroll any duplicate results).
* **Brake:** The vehicle moves half of its movement speed directly forward, then it loses momentum.

**Momentum.** At initiative count 20, all vehicles with momentum move half their movement speed directly forward. A vehicle�s momentum ends automatically after 1 minute if no actions are taken with it.

**Saving Throws.** Unlike most objects, vehicles must make Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws as if they were creatures against effects that would call for them. All vehicles have a Strength and Constitution score based on their size (see below). A driven vehicle has a Dexterity score equal to its driver�s Dexterity score (a vehicle without a driver has a Dexterity of 0).

Size

The size of a vehicle determines many of a vehicle�s properties:

**Strength, Constitution, and Carrying Capacity**. A vehicle�s Strength, Constitution, and carrying capacity are determined by its size.

* **Large:** A Large vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 14 (+2). It can carry up to 3 passengers along with the driver, up to 40 Supply, and up to 10 bulky items in addition to 2,000 pounds of carrying capacity.
* **Huge:** A Huge vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 18 (+4). It can carry up to 6 passengers along with the driver, up to 80 Supply, and up to 20 bulky items in addition to 4,000 pounds of carrying capacity.
* **Gargantuan:** A Gargantuan vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 22 (+6). It can carry a number of additional passengers equal to the minimum required crew, up to 800 Supply, and up to 200 bulky items in addition to 40,000 pounds of carrying capacity.

**Collisions**. If a vehicle has momentum and enters the space occupied by a creature or another object, a collision occurs. Both the vehicle and whatever it impacts take damage according to the vehicle�s size: Large�4d6 bludgeoning damage, Huge�8d6 bludgeoning damage, Gargantuan�12d6 bludgeoning damage.

If the object or creature impacted is the same size as the vehicle or larger, the vehicle immediately stops and loses momentum. If the object or creature impacted is smaller than the vehicle, it is shunted into the nearest unoccupied space that allows the vehicle to complete its movement unimpeded.

Malfunctions

When a vehicle is reduced to half its hit point maximum, roll 1d6 on Table: Malfunctions to determine what aspect of the vehicle breaks. Vehicle malfunctions are usually too extreme to repair quickly except by magical means. Malfunctions remain until the vehicle is restored to its hit point maximum.

**TABLE: MALFUNCTIONS**

|  |
| --- |
| **D6 MALFUNCTION** |
| **Movement.** Movement has been compromised, such as losing the sails,  1 losing the animal team drawing the vehicle, or destroying an engine. The  Drive, Maneuver, and Ahead Full actions cannot be taken until it is repaired. |
| **Integrity.** Some key component holding  2 everything together has been lost and the vehicle immediately loses an additional 25  percent of its hit point maximum. |
| **Brakes.** The ability to stop has been lost.  3 The Brake and Stop actions cannot be taken until repaired. |
| **Steering.** The driver�s ability to fully  4 control the vehicle has been compromised. The Drive and Maneuver  actions cannot be taken until repaired. |
| 5 **Cargo.** Half of any Supply currently carried by the vehicle are destroyed. |

**Superficial.** The damage looks bad but

6 doesn�t cause any further issues.

Special Features

Vehicles may possess any number of fantastical features, but the following are the most common:

**Armed**. Armed vehicles have one or more weapons in place on board (see Table: Siege Weaponry). A creature can use an action to fire or reload a siege weapon.

**Drawn**. A drawn vehicle is pulled by one or more beasts of burden and its movement and travel speeds are determined by the animal (or animals) pulling it.

**Personal**. Personal vehicles are designed for a single occupant and usually have far less space. Vehicles with this property can only ever carry a maximum of one person and have

one-fourth the carrying capacity of a normal vehicle of the same size.

**Three-dimensional**. Usually found on airships, a three-dimensional vehicle may also turn up or down when making turns.

**Transport**. Transport vehicles are designed for cargo and crew, and have twice the carrying capacity and maximum number of passengers as normal for a vehicle of the same size.

Repairing Vehicles

Repairing damaged or malfunctioning vehicles requires a tool check against the DC listed for the vehicle�s primary material, as shown on the Materials table. During a long rest you can make one check, ending any malfunctions it currently has on a success and restoring hit points equal to the result of your check. Alternatively you can hire someone to repair your vehicle for you (which is an automatic success and typically costs one-fifth of the vehicle�s total cost)

##### Lifestyle Expenses

There are three general categories of lifestyle: poor, moderate, and rich.

**Poor.** Dining and lodging in poor social circles is useful when seeking out underworld contacts, fences, and assassins. A poor lifestyle imposes a �1 Prestige penalty (to a minimum of 0).

**Moderate.** Dining and lodging in moderate social circles is useful when seeking out professionals in legitimate services, guild members, and specialists.

**Rich.** Dining and lodging in rich social circles is useful when seeking out nobility, heads of state, royalty, or any leader or high-ranking member of a major organization. A rich lifestyle grants a +1 Prestige bonus.

## Spending Gold

The following sections provide three distinct ways to spend gold: shopping for

material items, seeking out NPC services, and donating funds for city projects or factions an adventurer may be involved with.

##### Shopping

There are three primary types of establishments where an adventurer may purchase goods: adventuring outfitters, magic item suppliers, and smithies.

Adventuring Outfitters

In smaller settlements, these may be simple general stores with a limited stock. In larger settlements you are likely to find one or more well-stocked adventuring outfitters.

Magic Item Suppliers

If you are in a large city or metropolis�or you find yourself in a world where magic is the norm�you may just be able to go shopping for magic items.

Most magic item shops have a limited supply of uncommon and common magic items. Utility magic items are far more common in shops such as these. The Magic Items For Sale table gives you an idea of the typical stock of magic item suppliers.

Magic item suppliers are also useful locations narratively, as they may be frequented by notable adventurers, politicians, healers, and villains. Additionally, these shops sometimes have spellcasters on their staff that can perform spellcasting services for a fee, as described in the next section.

Smithies

Smithies are found in developed settlements of at least a few dozen people, with experienced smiths living in more populated areas. Here, adventurers can purchase any simple weapon. At the Narrator�s discretion, you might find martial weapons and regionally specific weapons when applicable. Smithies also have a selection of medium and heavy armors.

Light armor can be found at a leatherworker�s shop.

Smithies can also take custom orders. See the pricing guide for crafting items below for more details.

NPC Services

Listed below are descriptions of various services NPCs can provide throughout your adventures, as well as their associated fees.

Ordering Crafted Items

To determine the cost of having an item crafted, you must add the cost of materials and the crafter�s fee to the standard price for the item, although when rare materials are involved you may have to provide them instead of just paying for them. At the

Narrator�s discretion, the crafter�s fee may vary slightly based upon the crafter�s experience, settlement population, or some other variable. Refer to the Crafting Prices table to find the standard prices for crafter�s and materials fees. Use the storefront column to determine what kind of storefront said crafter is usually found in.

Renting a Demiplane

Occasionally you might find an eccentric wizard advertising the rental of a demiplane. These pocket dimensions are incredibly customizable and highly sought after.

Most starting rates for such spaces are 1,200 gp per tenday or 3,000 gp per month.

##### Donations

An adventurer may be moved to donate to charity or invest to the betterment of a settlement. There are boons and rewards for sponsoring a city project or helping develop a charitable organization. In order to benefit from a donation, you must contribute at least 1,000 gp.

Infrastructure Rewards

Stone Bridge (1,500 gp)

Donating the money for the bridge gives you the privilege of naming it. If it is a toll bridge, you never have to pay toll at this bridge or at any other toll in the settlement.

Additionally, you gain advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with common citizens of the settlement.

Improved Sewer System (4,000 gp)

When you donate money for a new or improved sewer system you gain exclusive access to the sewer blueprints, and you can order secret tunnels to be made between the sewers and any three buildings in the city. For an extra 3,000 gp, a small underground facility can be built inside the sewers. This facility does not count towards the other three buildings that have tunnel access.

City Buildings (2,500 gp)

When you fund the construction of a civic building, such as a town hall or police facility, you never have to make an appointment to see a city official.

Additionally, you gain advantage on Insight and Intimidation checks when interacting with city officials.

Philanthropic Rewards

Public Library (3,000 gp)

When you fund the building of a public library, you gain advantage on Investigation checks made to research using the library, so long as relevant information can be found there. Additionally, you may ask the scholar in residence to perform a research project on a specific topic. The project typically takes one week. The usefulness of the information produced by this research is left to the Narrator�s discretion.

Hospital (4,000 gp)

When you contribute to the building of a hospital, you gain free treatment by the medical staff. Medical staff immediately work to stabilize any dying character, regardless of whether they donated to the hospital. Common diseases can be treated in a week�s time. Treatment of rarer diseases and ailments are left to the Narrator�s discretion, and hospitals cannot treat magical ailments.

Orphanage (2,500 gp)

Characters who contribute to the building of an orphanage gain the trust of the youngsters of the street. You have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence orphans from this settlement. At the Narrator�s discretion, the staff of the orphanage may provide you useful information, such as the names of local

gangs recruiting orphans or the identities of an orphan�s parents.

School (3,000 gp)

Schools increase the likelihood of literacy amongst children, teenagers, and young adults in the town. Additionally, characters can recruit recent graduates of the settlement�s school as hirelings.

Community Botanical Garden (3,000 gp

A community garden gives the settlement access to plants used for medicinal and magical purposes�as well as good

old-fashioned cooking. After you build a garden, you have access to herbs and plants required for spell components, the brewing of potions, and the crafting of magical items. Additionally, you receive a 10 percent discount on all potions and food sold in this settlement.

Animal Sanctuary (10,000 gp)

An animal sanctuary is a great investment for any adventuring party, especially those that include rangers and druids. Animal sanctuaries provide an opportunity to learn about animals that you may not interact with every day. These institutions sell their creatures only to those they know will care for them, and when you invest in the

building of such a property, you receive a 50 percent discount on the animals found there.

##### Pets

While most pets are likely to be acquired over the course of an adventure, there is always the possibility of finding places with animals and magical beasts for sale. Use the Pets tables to determine the price for your party�s new furry (or scaly) friend.

Eggs

Some creatures are easier to train from birth, while others simply must be trained from birth, such as dragons. Refer to the Egg Prices table when you are looking to raise dragons and other undomesticated creatures. Note that none of these creatures can be acquired in a common market and are almost always handled by auction houses or the occasional private collector of eccentricities.

##### Starting Gear Past First Level

When starting at a higher level, you can choose to spend your starting gold on the following equipment packages, organized by tier (tier 2: 5th�10th level, tier 3:

11th�16th level, tier 4: 17th�20th level).

The higher-tier gear packages presented here are based on the starting gold of that tier�s lowest level (5th, 11th, and 17th level). When beginning at a level other than these, you subtract the value of the suggested starting packages from your starting gold for that level and gain the difference. Note that sometimes leftover gold from your tier�s suggested package is enough to also buy a lower-tier equipment package.

##### Building a Stronghold

**TABLE: STRONGHOLD SIZE**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GRADE** | **BUILDING AREA** | **RURAL AREA** |
| 1 | 100�1,000 square ft.  (about 25 feet � 25 feet) | 1�5  acres |
| 2 | 1,001�5,000 square feet (about 50 feet � 50 feet) | 5�10  acres |
| 3 | 5,001�10,000  square feet (about 85 feet � 85 feet) | 11�20  acres |
| 4 | 10,001�25,000  square feet (about 130 feet � 130 feet) | 21�60  acres |
| 5 | 25,001�50,000  square feet (about 195 feet � 195 feet) | 61�120  acres |
| 6 | 50,001�100,000  square feet (about 275 feet � 275 feet) | 121�250  acres |
| 7 | 100,001�250,000  square feet (about 420 feet � 420 feet) | 251�600  acres |
| 8 | 250,001+ square feet (more than 500 feet � 500 feet) | 601+  acres |

A stronghold offers benefits that are designed to be equal or superior to the equivalent expenditure in arms and equipment.

**Haven.** Unless the Narrator deems otherwise, you are always able to use your stronghold as a haven.

##### Stronghold Types

Choose your stronghold�s type from the list of stronghold types: castle, encampment, farm, guildhouse, house, laboratory, library, menagerie, sacred grove, shop, tavern, temple, training hall, or workshop. The type of stronghold you choose defines the nature of the benefits it grants you.

##### Size

Choose a size for your stronghold. A stronghold�s basic cost is **1 gp per square foot for a building**, or **500 gp per acre for a rural stronghold**. Strongholds of grade 7 and higher are usually out of the reach of most adventurers.

The size is the overall �footprint� or total space occupied by your stronghold. You can choose how much of it is physical structures and how much is external grounds such as gardens and courtyards.

**Buildings.** These strongholds are primarily structures, although they may include land. You decide how much of the space you�ve paid for is part of the building and how much is external grounds and gardens. When purchasing a building use the Building Area column of Table: Stronghold Size.

**Rural.** Some strongholds are not primarily based upon a structure. These strongholds tend to be larger than those based upon buildings, with expanses of open land. When purchasing a rural stronghold, use the Rural Area column of Table: Stronghold Size.

Rural strongholds may include frugal structures such as barns or tents, and a single dwelling such as a farmhouse.

These structures do not cost extra and are not considered sub-strongholds.

##### Unusual Strongholds

**TABLE: UNUSUAL STRONGHOLDS**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FEATURE** | **COST MULTIPLIER** | **MINIMUM COST** |
| Disguised/hidden |  |  |
| (like a thieves� guild | �2 | � |
| disguised as a |  |  |
| legitimate business) |  |  |
| Garrison | �2 | � |
| Income | �2 | � |
| Island | �3 | 1,000 gp |
| Mountaintop | �3 | 1,500 gp |
| Underground | �3 | 2,000 gp |
| Underwater | �5 | 4,000 gp |
| Floating in the air | �10 | 20,000 gp |
| Wondrous materials  (such as adamantine) | �10 | 30,000 gp |
| Pocket dimension | �50 | 35,000 gp |

Now that you have the basics of your stronghold, you can apply large multipliers to your stronghold cost in order to give it unusual traits. This modifier applies to the base cost of the stronghold, before you apply furnishings.

**Minimum Cost.** Note that there is a minimum cost for certain features. If your stronghold total cost is less than this minimum cost, its price is increased to the minimum cost. The minimum cost is applied before multipliers for furnishings and staff.

**Income.** Shops, taverns, and other businesses are assumed to break even, and neither generate income nor lose money. However, you may choose to have your stronghold generate an income. This is generally a long-term

option, and the stronghold generates one-tenth its value every year. You may choose how frequently you collect this income.

##### Furnishings and Staff

Features include furnishings, staff, security elements, and so on. Furnishings are easy to do�you simply decide how much you wish to spend from the Stronghold Furnishings and Staff table and multiply the cost of your stronghold by the amount shown for its total cost. This multiplier applies to the entire stronghold.

**Selling Items**. You cannot simply sell off individual items�it�s all part of a general cost�but if you are in desperate need of money you can downgrade your stronghold�s furnishings and recover half the money you spent.

**Staff**. Staff come with the stronghold and include all household workers and laborers, but not soldiers or special hirelings. The number of staff you have is determined by the quality of the stronghold you�ve chosen and its size (as per the Stronghold Furnishings and Staff table), rounding down (minimum 0). If you change the quality or size of your stronghold, your staff levels increase or decrease accordingly.

There is no expectation that all of your staff will be on duty or on the property at a given time.

**Garrison.** Choosing the garrison feature gives your stronghold a number of **soldiers** equal to half the stronghold�s staff level. For every 30 soldiers, you also gain one **veteran**, and for every 200 soldiers you gain one **knight**. At the Narrator�s discretion, other NPCs (or monsters) may be part of your garrison. A garrison is used to defend a stronghold and cannot be taken adventuring.

**TABLE: STRONGHOLD FURNISHINGS AND STAFF**

##### Combining Strongholds

You can combine multiple strongholds. You must pay the cost for both. A sub-stronghold must be half the size or smaller in square feet than the stronghold in which it is placed, and must be of the same quality.

##### Multiple Strongholds

You can have as many strongholds as you�re able to buy, but you only ever truly call one of them home. When you gain an additional stronghold, you may immediately choose to make it your permanent stronghold. Otherwise it takes a week of staying in a stronghold for it to become your permanent stronghold. You only gain the benefits granted by your permanent stronghold (including any sub-strongholds within it).

**Stronghold Ability Score Increase.** The only increase to an ability score you gain is from the first stronghold that grants this benefit. Changing your permanent stronghold or purchasing

sub-strongholds does not alter your ability scores.

**Prestige Bonus.** Your Prestige bonus is determined by your most expensive stronghold, and you do not gain additional Prestige from having additional strongholds.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **QUALITY** | **COST**  **MULTI- PLIER** | **STAFF BY STRONG- HOLD SIZE (STRUCTURE)** | **RURAL** |
| Frugal | �1/2 | 1 per 1,000 square ft. | 1 per 5 acres |
| Average | � | 1 per 500 square ft. | 1 per 2 acres |
| Luxurious | �2 | 1 per 100 square ft. | 1 per acre |
| Legendary | �5 | 1 per 100 square ft. | 1 per acre |

**Prestige Center.** When you change your stronghold, you may also choose to make it your Prestige Center, though if you are purchasing an already constructed building it takes a week to take effect, as stories of your arrival and deeds circulate about the region.

##### Prestige and Increasing a Stronghold

The final value of your stronghold (including any sub-strongholds) determines the amount of additional Prestige you gain. The prestige bonus granted by your stronghold is shown in Table: Stronghold Prestige. The cost to increase your stronghold�s size later is modified by its furnishings and any other

cost multipliers.

**TABLE: STRONGHOLD PRESTIGE**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **COST** | **PRESTIGE BONUS** |
| 101�1,000 gp | +0 |
| 1,001�25,000 gp | +1 |
| 25,001�50,000 gp | +2 |
| 50,001�100,000 gp | +3 |
| 100,001�250,000 gp | +4 |
| 250,001+ gp | +5 |

##### Stronghold Types

There are many different types of strongholds, from small townhouses to

mighty castles and mysterious wizard�s towers.

**Free Followers.** Each type of stronghold grants its owner a stronghold feat, as well as additional followers. For every 100 staff you have, you gain 1 free follower. You may choose the type of free follower from the list associated with your stronghold type. Followers granted by your stronghold start at inexperienced, increasing to seasoned when you reach 9th level, and expert at 17th level.

**Stronghold Ability Score Increase.** When you acquire a stronghold of Grade 3 or higher or upgrade a stronghold to Grade 3, one of your ability scores increases by 1, determined by the type of stronghold (see Table: Stronghold Ability Score Increase).

When you acquire a stronghold of Grade 6 or higher or upgrade a stronghold to Grade 6, your ability score increases by 2, and the maximum for that ability score increases by 2.

If you have a choice between ability scores, you choose which ability score to increase each time you gain this benefit.

**Other Stronghold Benefits.** Most benefits from a stronghold only affect its owner�every member of an adventuring party might chip in for a castle, but there�s only one name on the deed.

## Followers

The maximum number of followers you may have is equal to your Prestige rating, increased by any bonuses you might have from owning a stronghold, or as a reward by the Narrator for accomplishing great deeds.

Followers aren�t the same as the general staff that maintains your stronghold.

Followers are loyal, dedicated to you and your cause, can accompany you on adventures, and provide benefits while out in the field.

Followers never participate directly in encounters. They fade into the background and come to the fore occasionally when their particular skill is needed. Each follower grants a specific ability or benefit.

##### Recruiting Followers

When you recruit a follower, you need to spend gold. In exchange, you get the follower for life. 500 gp recruits an inexperienced follower, 2,000 gp recruits a seasoned follower, and 5,000 gp recruits an expert follower. You only need to pay this once per follower; it is assumed that the amount paid is enough to accommodate the follower for the duration of the campaign. If you dismiss the follower, the Narrator might permit you to reclaim some of that money. If the follower dies, you do not get any money back. Note that not all followers have seasoned or expert versions�carrying a torch isn�t the purview of only experts.

**Inexperienced.** Inexperienced followers are little more than commoners foolish enough to follow adventurers into a dungeon.

**Seasoned.** Seasoned followers have either prior employment with adventurers or other experience that prepared them for adventuring.

**Expert.** Expert followers are consummate professionals, rare individuals who have had their share of adventures but are comfortable in their role as assistant.

# Multiclassing

Whenever you gain a character level, you can choose to gain a level in a different class instead of gaining the next level in your current class. Your character level is the total number of levels you have in any classes.

Multiclassing allows you to freely develop your adventurer in whatever direction you see fit. Compared to an adventurer of a single class, you�ll have a wider range of options, but you will reach more powerful class features later than most.

## Experience Points

If your game is utilizing experience points (XP), your XP cost to gain new class levels is based on your character level and not your level in any class.

## Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain a class�s hit points described for 1st level only from your very first level as a 1st level character. Any levels gained from multiclassing gain the hit points as described for levels after 1st level, even if they would be the first level gained in a particular class.

If your classes both provide the same hit die type, you can simply pool them together. If your classes provide different hit die types, you must keep track of them separately and you may spend them as you choose for any features that require hit dice.

## Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is based on your character level, not on any one class.

## Proficiencies

You only gain some of the 1st level proficiencies from classes taken after your first class, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

**TABLE: MULTICLASSING PROFICIENCIES**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **CLASS** | **PROFICIENCIES GAINED** |
| Adept | Simple weapons, shortswords |
| Berserker | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Bard | Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice |
| Cleric | Two from Culture, History, Medicine, or Religion |
| Druid | Light armor, medium armor, shields (characters with druid levels lose proficiency with metal armor and shields and cannot gain it) |
| Fighter | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Herald | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Marshal | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |
| Ranger | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class� skill list |
| Rogue | Light armor, one skill from the class� skill list, thieves� tools |
| Sorcerer | Arcana |
| Warlock | Light armor, simple weapons |
| Wizard | Arcana |

## Starting Equipment

You only gain the starting equipment of your first class at 1st level. You do not gain any additional starting equipment from your first levels in additional classes.

## Class Features

Whenever you gain a new level in a class, you gain the class features for that level. Some features are found in multiple classes and need additional rules when combined: **Alternate Armor Class**, **Combat Maneuvers**, **Extra Attack**, and **Spellcasting**.

## Alternate Armor Class

Multiple instances of any feature that provides an alternate Armor Class calculation do not stack and cannot combine in any way. If you have multiple features that provide an alternate Armor Class calculation, your AC is equal to the highest Armor Class calculation that currently applies.

## Combat Maneuvers

If you gain the Combat Maneuvers class feature from more than one class, you gain any additional combat traditions or maneuvers the features provide but your exertion pool remains the same and does not stack.

***Heralds.*** The herald is an exception to this rule. If your first levels are in the herald class, you gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

You regain exertion spent from this pool at the end of a rest.

You use your class levels in every class that grants combat maneuvers to determine the highest degree of combat maneuvers you can learn, determined by the class with the greatest access.

## Extra Attack

You cannot stack multiple instances of the Extra Attack feature from multiple classes, and additional instances of the feature do not add additional attacks.

***Fighters and Marshals.*** The additional 11th level Extra attack feature gained by fighters and marshals are both exceptions to this rule (a fighter 5/marshal 6 can attack 3 times with the Attack action.)

## Spellcasting

If you gain the Spellcasting feature from only one class you follow the spellcasting rules found in that class. However, if you gain the Spellcasting feature from different classes you must use the following rules.

##### Spells Known and Prepared

You know and prepare the spells of each of your classes as if you only had levels in that class. Each spell you know and prepare uses the Spellcasting feature of the associated class, including spellcasting ability and any spellcasting focus.

##### Spell Slots

| 20th | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

Your total number of spell slots is determined by adding together all the class levels you have from classes with the Spellcasting feature, but some classes do not count as highly as others when determining your spell slots.

Your class levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes all count fully towards your spell slots.

Half your levels in the herald class count towards your spell slots.

One third of your levels in the ranger class with the Wildborn archetype count towards your spell slots.

Use this total to determine your spell slots using the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

This table may provide you with spell slots at levels higher than you can prepare or know. While you cannot use these slots for spells you don�t know or can�t prepare, you can still use them to enhance many lower level spells.

##### Pact Magic

If you have a Spellcasting class feature and the warlock�s Pact Magic class feature, you may spend spell points gained from your Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know from your Spellcasting class feature.

Similarly, you can use spell slots gained from your Spellcasting feature to cast warlock spells you know.

# Feats

A feat grants an adventurer special abilities beyond their class features.

Whenever your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can instead choose a feat. Unless otherwise noted, you can take each feat only once.

In order to take a feat or gain its benefits, you must meet its prerequisites (if any).

## Magical Feats

If you are a warlock and select a feat that allows you to choose your spellcasting ability (such as taking Power Caster and choosing a warlock cantrip), you must use the spellcasting ability chosen when you became a warlock. When taking multiple feats that allow you to choose your spellcasting ability and selecting options to cast warlock spells, you must use the spellcasting ability chosen when you took the first of these feats.

True Revenant

*Prerequisite: Revenant feat*

One year and one day after you select this feat or when your vendetta has ended, you are doomed. Until then, you gain the following benefits.

* You cannot be charmed, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned.
* You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
* You regain all of your hit points after you do not take any damage for 1 minute.

In addition, you also gain the Fearsome Pursuit and Burning Hatred features.

**Fearsome Pursuit.** You can spend 1 minute focusing on a creature that is part of your vendetta. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, you learn that. Otherwise, after focusing, you know the distance and direction to that creature, and so long as you�re moving in pursuit of that creature, you and anyone traveling with you ignore difficult terrain. This effect ends if you take damage or end your turn without moving for any reason.

**Burning Hatred.** You can use an action to target the focus of your Fearsome Pursuit if it is within 30 feet. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your highest mental ability score modifier). On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to 1d6 � your proficiency bonus and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and is rattled until the end of its next turn. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can�t use it again until you finish a long rest.

##### Vengeful Protector

*Prerequisite: Proficiency with shields*

* + You gain proficiency with shields as weapons.
  + You gain proficiency with the Double Team maneuver and do not have to spend exertion to activate it.

##### Vigilante

*Prerequisites: 3 levels in adept, 3 levels in ranger*

* + Your Wisdom or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
  + You have an alter ego, an identity associated with a

costume or disguise. This alter ego can be as complicated as a full outfit with a history or legends surrounding it or a simple mask or cowl. You can assume or remove this alter ego as an action and it can be worn with all types of armor.

* You gain a 1d8 expertise die and advantage on Deception checks made regarding your alter ego, Persuasion checks made to dissuade others from connecting you to your alter ego, and on disguise kit checks.
* Your alter ego has its own Prestige rating that may increase or decrease as you perform deeds while in your alter ego. In addition, while in your alter ego you gain a 1d8 expertise die on Prestige checks.

Equipped for Justice

*Prerequisite: Vigilante feat*

* + You gain proficiency with all types of artisan�s tools and miscellaneous tools. If you already have proficiency with any of these tools, you instead gain an expertise die with those tools.
  + You gain proficiency with Engineering and a 1d8 expertise die on Engineering checks. In addition, you build a nonmagical grappling gun that

In addition, you become particularly adept at subduing your enemies rather than outright killing them. Whenever you begin a turn grappling a creature, you can attempt to non-lethally subdue it. The grappled creature makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature is knocked unconscious for the next hour. A creature with more than 25% of its maximum hit points automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

# Ability Scores

Every creature has six ability scores to describe their physical attributes and mental characteristics: **Strength** for muscle, **Dexterity** for agility and reflexes, **Constitution** for health and hardiness, **Intelligence** for memory and wits, **Wisdom** for awareness and intuition, and **Charisma** for charm and force of personality.

An ability score of 10 or 11 is average. Adventurers can reach scores as high as 20, and monsters can have ability scores as high as 30.

## Ability Score Modifiers

**TABLE: ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **SCORE** | **MODIFIER** |
| 1 | �5 |
| 2�3 | �4 |
| 4�5 | �3 |
| 6�7 | �2 |
| 8�9 | �1 |
| 10�11 | +0 |
| 12�13 | +1 |
| 14�15 | +2 |
| 16�17 | +3 |
| 18�19 | +4 |
| 20�21 | +5 |
| 22�23 | +6 |
| 24�25 | +7 |
| 26�27 | +8 |
| 28�29 | +9 |
| 30 | +10 |

Each ability has a modifier derived from its score. Table: Ability Score Modifiers lists the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30, but note only through extraordinary circumstances can a player character have an ability score below 8 or above 20.

The most common rolls of the game�ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws�rely on the ability modifiers derived from the six ability scores. Because ability modifiers affect almost every roll, they come up during play more often than their associated scores.

## Ability Checks

An ability check is made to determine whether a creature succeeds at a task other than an attack. The Narrator chooses which ability the creature should use and assigns a number representing the task�s Difficulty Class or DC. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC (see Table: Typical Difficulty Classes).

**TABLE: TYPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASSES**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **TASK DIFFICULTY** | **DC** |
| Very easy | 5 |
| Easy | 10 |
| Medium | 15 |
| Hard | 20 |
| Very hard | 25 |
| Nearly impossible | 30 |

To make an ability check for a certain ability, roll a d20 and add the ability�s modifier and any other relevant bonuses and penalties. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the creature succeeds at the task. Otherwise, the creature fails, making little or no progress towards its goal.

## Passive Checks

A passive check is an ability check made without die rolls. It can represent a creature�s typical result on a repeated task. To determine a character�s total for a passive check, add 10 to the ability�s modifier and any other relevant bonuses and penalties. If the character has advantage on the check, add 5, and if they have an expertise die add 3. If the character has disadvantage, subtract 5.

The most common use of a passive check is a passive Wisdom (Perception) check.

When a character first experiences a new scene or location, the Narrator describes what they sense based on their perceptiveness. A highly perceptive character might automatically detect dangers a less perceptive character wouldn�t notice, such as hidden opponents or traps.

## Contests

When one creature�s efforts directly oppose another�s, the outcome is determined by contested ability checks�a contest.

Each contestant makes an ability check as normal. Instead of comparing the results to a DC, the participant with the higher check wins the contest. If the results are tied, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest.

An initiative check is a type of contested ability check to determine the order of action during an encounter.

## Advantage, Disadvantage, Expertise, and DC Modifiers

When the Narrator asks for an ability check, it might be modified by circumstances, spells, features, or traits that grant advantage (roll twice and use the higher result), disadvantage (roll twice and use the lower result), or expertise dice (roll and add an extra die).

When the player knows about the factors which affect their action, these usually take the form of expertise dice or advantage or disadvantage. Expertise dice represent training and other details, and the character taking the action is fully aware of these effects.

Sometimes the Narrator knows about factors which affect the difficulty of a task that the player is not aware of. In these situations the Narrator secretly applies modifiers to the DC of the ability check.

## Using Each Ability

##### Strength

Strength Checks

Strength is used for any attempt to move or break something, to jump, climb, or swim beyond your usual physical limits, and to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

Attack Rolls and Damage

When you make an attack roll using a weapon, you add your Strength modifier to the attack roll and the damage roll. Some

weapons, such as the javelin, can also be thrown to make a ranged attack using Strength.

Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score and modifier are both used to determine how much you can carry.

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score � 15. This is the weight (in pounds) you can carry as you go about day-to-day business. If you exceed your carrying capacity, you are encumbered.

**Bulky Items.** You can carry a number of bulky items equal to 1 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1). If you exceed this number, you are encumbered.

**Supply.** You can carry a number of supplies equal to your Strength score in addition to the rest of your gear.

**Drag, Lift, or Push.** You can drag, lift, or push up to your Strength score � 30. While moving weight in excess of your carrying capacity you are encumbered.

**Size and Strength.** A Tiny creature�s carrying capacity is halved and it can�t carry bulky objects. For each size category above Medium, larger creatures double their carrying capacity, the number of bulky items they can carry, and the amount they can push, drag, or lift.

##### Dexterity

Dexterity Checks

Dexterity is used for any attempt to balance, move quietly, or to perform tasks focused on deft-fingered movements rather than force.

Attack Rolls and Damage

When you make an attack roll using a ranged weapon, you add your Dexterity

modifier to the attack roll and the damage roll. When using a melee weapon with the finesse property, you can choose to use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier.

Armor Class

The armor you wear determines whether you add any, some, or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

##### Constitution

Constitution Checks

Constitution is used for any attempt to physically push beyond normal limits over a period of time.

Hit Points

Whenever you increase your hit point maximum when gaining a level or roll Hit Dice to recover hit points, you add your Constitution modifier. When rolling Hit Dice, you add the modifier to each dice roll.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum also changes as if you always had the new modifier.

##### Intelligence

Intelligence Checks

Intelligence is frequently used to recall details of the shared adventure world, representing memory and education�knowledge obvious to a character even if unknown or forgotten by their player. It is also used to represent reasoning.

Bonus Knowledge

Having a higher Intelligence means having more knowledge than other characters.

During character creation, for each point of your Intelligence modifier above 0 you can choose a skill specialty chosen from lore skills (Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, Religion). If you are not proficient in any lore skills you instead either gain proficiency with a lore skill, choose an extra language known, or pick a tool proficiency in one artisan�s tool, gaming kit, instrument, or vehicle.

If your Intelligence modifier changes, it affects your bonus knowledge. When your Intelligence modifier increases, you can choose an additional skill specialty in the skills listed above as if you always had the new modifier. If your Intelligence modifier decreases you must remove the last benefit from your bonus knowledge. If your Intelligence modifier drops below 0, you don�t lose more knowledge than you gained from bonus knowledge.

If you lose bonus knowledge due to a decrease in Intelligence, at the Narrator�s discretion you might choose a new bonus knowledge the next time your Intelligence modifier increases (instead of regaining the lost bonus knowledge).

Spellcasting Ability

Wizards and some warlocks use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability to determine their spell attack bonus and the saving throw DCs of the spells they cast. Intelligence also determines the number of spells a wizard can prepare each day.

##### Wisdom

Wisdom Checks

Wisdom is frequently used to notice details of the shared adventure world immediately around you, representing what you perceive in the moment�the present world obvious to your character as described by the Narrator. It is also used to understand feelings and emotions, and discern cryptic omens on an intuitive rather than logical level.

Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and some warlocks use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which determines their spell attack bonus and the saving throw DCs of the spells they cast.

Wisdom also determines the number of spells a cleric or druid can prepare each day.

##### Charisma

Charisma Checks

Charisma is used in social situations to determine first impressions, to fit in or stand out, and to influence others.

Spellcasting Ability

Bards, heralds, sorcerers, and some warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which determines their spell attack bonus and the saving throw DCs of the spells they cast. Charisma also determines the number of spells a herald can prepare each day.

## Working Together

When multiple characters cooperate on a task, one character makes the ability check. They do so with advantage. While in initiative, the Help action is used for cooperative efforts.

A character can�t help with a task that they couldn�t attempt alone, or that doesn�t benefit from multiple participants.

##### Group Checks

When all individuals in a scene are attempting the same thing as a group, such as climbing a cliff or sneaking up on an enemy camp, the Narrator calls for a group check (described in the Introduction).

## Proficiency Bonus

Every creature has a proficiency bonus determined by its level (for PCs) or its challenge rating (for monsters and most NPCs). The bonus is used for ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws when a creature has a relevant proficiency.

When applicable, you add your proficiency bonus to a d20 roll. If two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a roll, you still only add the bonus once.

Some rules might modify your proficiency bonus before it is applied to a roll. If multiple rules modify the proficiency bonus in the same way, you still only modify it that way once.

## Saving Throws

A saving throw (sometimes called a save) gives a creature a chance to avoid a threat. You make a saving throw when you�re at risk of harm. Each saving throw is made against a Difficulty Class, which is set by the

effect that causes it. Although you typically will not want to, you can always choose to fail a saving throw.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the ability modifier called for by the circumstances as well as any other relevant modifiers. A saving throw can have advantage, disadvantage, or expertise dice applied.

All characters, and some monsters, gain saving throw proficiencies. Proficiency in a saving throw for a certain ability lets you add your proficiency bonus to saving throws using that ability.

A successful save usually means that a creature avoids or reduces harm, while a failure means that the creature suffers more serious consequences.

## Skills

While abilities provide broad descriptions of a character�s capabilities, a skill represents their training in a particular task such as Acrobatics or Deception. A character who has training in a skill is said to be proficient in it. Most skill proficiencies are acquired by adventurers during character creation from their choice of culture, background, and class.

##### Using Skills

When a character attempts an ability check, the Narrator may decide that a specific skill is relevant to the check. If a character is proficient in that skill, they may add their proficiency bonus to their ability check.

Any skill can be used with any ability check, although some pairings are more common than others. For instance, the Deception skill is commonly used with Charisma ability checks.

Sometimes the Narrator will ask for an ability check using a certain skill. Other times, a Narrator may ask for an ability check, and a player might ask whether one of their skills applies to the check. The Narrator is the sole arbiter of which skill, if any, applies to an ability check. The rules sometimes refer to a check with a skill but no ability specified. This refers to all ability checks using that skill regardless of which ability score is used.

##### Skill Specialties

In addition to having proficiency in a skill, a character may be an expert at a narrow area of specialization within that skill.

A character gains two skill specialties at 1st level (plus bonus knowledge granted by Intelligence), and gains an additional specialty whenever their proficiency bonus increases (at levels 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level). A character may choose any specialty in a skill in which they are proficient. A character may not gain the same skill specialty twice.

When a character makes an ability check to which their skill specialty applies, they gain an expertise die for that ability check. The Narrator determines whether the skill specialty applies.

The Narrator may expand the list of skill specialties to meet the needs of the campaign world. Each of its cultures, historical eras, important organizations, and other unique details might furnish a specialty.

##### List of Skills

Characters can gain proficiency in the following skills. The Narrator determines which ability score is called for in a given situation.

**Acrobatics.** An Acrobatics check allows a character to perform gymnastic feats such as rolling under a closing gate, swinging across a chasm on a rope, or keeping their balance on a narrow ledge. The most commonly used ability score is Dexterity. A character might use Strength to perform acrobatics while carrying a heavy burden or Constitution to do so against a heavy wind.

Specialties: balancing, escape artistry, swinging, tumbling.

**Animal Handling.** Animal Handling allows a character to train or control a domesticated animal, to handle a steed, or to communicate nonaggression to a wild beast. The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Charisma to command an animal�s attention, Strength to stay mounted on a rampaging bull, or Dexterity to stand on the back of a galloping horse.

Specialties: calming, driving, farming, riding, training.

**Arcana.** Arcana measures a character�s knowledge of magic and magical creatures. It can also be used to sense whether an area has magical qualities.

The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Dexterity to trace a complicated magical rune, or Wisdom to read very carefully and protect their sanity while interpreting forbidden eldritch secrets.

Specialties: aberrations, constructs, detection, dragons, elementals, fey, forbidden knowledge, monstrosities, oozes, the planes.

**Athletics.** A character makes an Athletics check to perform unusually difficult feats of swimming, running, climbing, or jumping. The most commonly used ability score is Strength. A character might use Dexterity to climb a smooth

wall for a short distance or to jump onto a moving creature, Constitution to perform an athletic activity for more than a minute, or Intelligence to keep track of opposing players in a complex sport.

Specialties: climbing, jumping, lifting, running, swimming, throwing.

**Culture.** A Culture check allows a character to know the customs, laws, trade in regional products, and etiquette of cultures other than their own (a character is presumed to know about their own culture and background without requiring an ability check). Culture can also be used to communicate simple concepts with creatures whose language is unknown to a character. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Wisdom to avoid social blunders, Dexterity to perform an unfamiliar dance, or Charisma to track down a seller of a hard-to-find item.

Specialties: courtly manners, etiquette, laws, linguistics, regional goods, streetwise, trade.

**Deception.** The Deception skill is used when a character lies, misleads, or hides the truth whether verbally or otherwise. This ability check may be made against a DC set by the Narrator or may be opposed by a target�s Insight check. The most commonly used ability score is Charisma. A character might use Intelligence to compose a cipher or Constitution to conceal the effect of a wound or attack.

Specialties: boasting, ciphers, concealing emotions, mimicry.

**Engineering.** An Engineering check allows a character to know a fact or advance a project involving building, invention, or mathematics. The most commonly used ability score is

Intelligence. A character might use Dexterity to construct a tiny device or Strength to build a wall without assistance.

Specialties: architecture, chemistry, explosives, gadgetry, mathematics, mechanical traps, siegecraft.

**History.** The History skill measures a character�s knowledge of past events. Intelligence is nearly always the ability score used with this skill.

Specialties: arts, empires, genealogy, legends, wars.

**Insight.** An Insight check can be used for reading a creature�s intentions or motives. The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Dexterity to interrupt an enemy�s sudden action.

Specialties: detecting lies, reading emotions, sensing motives.

**Intimidation.** A character makes an Intimidation check to alter someone�s behavior by frightening or threatening them. A single Intimidation check can also be used as part of an interrogation, though further checks rarely offer different results. The Narrator sets the DC of the check based on the target�s bravery and the circumstances of the check; some creatures can�t be intimidated. The most commonly used ability scores for Intimidation checks are Charisma (for verbal threats) and Strength (for physical threats). A character might use Wisdom to discern a creature�s weak point, and a spellcaster might use their spellcasting ability score to summon frightening energies.

Specialties: authority, ferocity, interrogation, subtle threats, weapon displays.

**Investigation.** Investigation is used for actively searching, looking for clues,

gathering information, experimentation, and research. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Charisma to gather rumors or Wisdom to intuit which tomes and books in a library will be the most efficacious.

Specialties: animals, autopsy, diseases, herbalism, poisons.

**Nature.** The Nature skill measures a character�s knowledge of natural terrains, beasts, plants, and hazards. It can also be used to sense whether a creature is the product of this world or of another plane of existence. Unlike Survival, the Nature skill doesn�t necessarily imply practical experience with a phenomenon. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Wisdom to recognize a hazard or Charisma to bring calm to an errant elemental presence disrupting an abandoned druid�s grove.

Specialties: astronomy, beast lore, farming, fey, plant lore, weather.

**Perception.** A character�s Perception measures what they are able to see, hear, or otherwise sense (unlike Investigation, Perception doesn�t involve approaching, searching, or handling an object of study.) The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Constitution for a long stretch of sentinel

duty, or Intelligence to pick up on changes to the type of stone bricks used deeper than elsewhere in a dungeon.

Specialties: farsight, invisible objects, listening, scent.

**Performance.** A Performance check allows a character to entertain an audience with singing, acting, or the like. It also allows a character to write or compose music, literature, or other artistic endeavors to entertain future audiences. The most commonly used ability score is Charisma, especially for performances before an audience. Writing, composing, or painting might instead use Intelligence or Wisdom. A display of martial prowess might require Dexterity or Strength.

Specialties: acting, composing, dancing, fine art, singing, speaking, writing.

**Persuasion.** A character makes a Persuasion check to convince or influence someone through logic, flattery, or negotiation (unlike a Deception check, a Persuasion check is made in some degree of good faith.) The Narrator sets the DC of the Persuasion check based on what the character is asking for and how the target feels about the character; some persuasion attempts may be impossible. The most commonly used ability score is Charisma. Wisdom might be used for gauging what offers would sway a creature, or Intelligence if it is a matter entirely about logic.

Specialties: bribery, flattery, leadership, negotiation, peacemaking.

**Religion.** Religion measures a character�s knowledge of gods, religions, rites, and systems of morality. A character can also try to use it to sense if a place, person, or object has the Good or Evil alignment traits or a holy or unholy aura. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. Wisdom is used for sensing

alignment and determining whether an action is moral according to a particular philosophy. Charisma can be used for preaching.

Specialties: alignment, celestials, cults, fiends, holy symbols, gods, morality, prophecy, undead.

**Sleight of Hand.** A character makes a Sleight of Hand check to perform legerdemain, pickpocket, hide an object on another creature, make a concealed hand signal, or otherwise deceive the eyes with feats of agility. Dexterity is nearly always the ability score used with this skill.

Specialties: distraction, pickpocketing, legerdemain.

**Stealth.** Stealth is used to hide or avoid notice. A creature�s Stealth check is usually opposed by a potential observer�s Perception check. The most commonly used ability score for Stealth is Dexterity. Constitution might be used for staying still for a very long time, Intelligence for casing out an unfrequented route, and Charisma for blending anonymously into a crowd.

Specialties: anonymity, camouflage, casing.

**Survival.** The Survival skill allows a character to perform the tasks necessary to thrive in the wilderness: hunting, tracking, avoiding natural hazards, and traveling without getting lost (unlike Nature, a Survival check doesn�t imply knowledge of the trouble you�re avoiding or tracking.) The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Constitution to weather a storm or Intelligence to follow a route marked on an old map.

Specialties: dungeoneering, foraging, hunting, tracking, wayfinding.

##### Stealth and Hiding

To attempt to hide from a creature, you must be unseen (behind something, obscured, invisible, or otherwise out of sight) and unheard by that creature, as well as undetected by any other special senses that it might possess. Make a Stealth check.

This check�s total is used until you stop hiding or are discovered. If a creature sees you while you are hiding or makes a successful Perception check to locate you, or you make a noise that it can overhear, you are discovered and are no longer hidden from that creature.

## Ability Check Criticals

When you use a skill and roll a natural 20 and succeed, or roll a natural 1 and fail, roll 1d6 to determine what special effect occurs. Because of the benefits of ability check criticals, some players may try a variety of easy ability checks to get a critical effect.

The Narrator is always the arbiter of these critical effects and can rule that if an ability check is superfluous or insignificant, any resulting natural 20s and natural 1s have no special effect.

**Tool Kits.** Whether or not a tool kit is appropriate for an Ability Check Critical and for which type it qualifies is at the Narrator�s discretion.

##### Arcane

Arcane criticals only occur when an active magical effect is involved. This might be the response to a *counterspell* or *dispel magic,* the activation of a specific magic item, or interaction with a ritual or permanent enchantment. When an arcane critical success or critical failure would not apply to the effect that activated it, reroll.

Critical Success

1. **Arcane Surge.** You gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points last 1 hour.
2. **Comfort in the Arcane.** For the next 24 hours, when making Arcana checks, you can choose to gain a result as if you had rolled a 10 on the die instead of rolling.
3. **Expanded Use.** If the magic item or effect targets a set number of targets, you may add one additional target within range.
4. **Free Use.** If activating a scroll or item with charges (such as a wand), you do not expend the scroll or any charges.
5. **Lucky Magic.** You gain an expertise die on Arcana checks for the next 24 hours.
6. **Metamagic Use.** Choose one minor metamagic effect from those found in the sorcerer class and apply it to the spell.

Critical Failure

1. **Arcane Feedback.** You take 1 point of damage per spell level.
2. **Break Device.** The activated item gains the broken condition or, in the case of a scroll, it is destroyed entirely.
3. **Delayed Activation.** At some point within the next 1d12 hours, the magic device randomly activates. The target is chosen by the Narrator.
4. **Misaligned Aiming.** The device activates, but the target of the item�s effect or spell changes to a target of the Narrator�s choosing.
5. **Unlucky Magic.** You are rattled for the next 2d4 hours.
6. **Wasteful Usage.** If activating an item with charges (such as a wand), you use 5 charges (even if the device does not activate).

##### Facts and Discoveries

Includes skills such as Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival.

Critical Success

1. **Doctorate.** This subject is one of your areas of study and some of it is coming back to you. For the next 24 hours, you gain an expertise die on ability checks using this skill so long as the check is for similar subjects.
2. **Forgotten Language.** Choose the language most closely associated with the target (if none or if you already know the language, roll again). If this is your first time getting a critical success with that language, you remember that you studied it long ago. Write down the language. The next time you roll this result, you permanently learn the language.
3. **Moment of Revelation.** You gain the benefits of a single *augury* spell (although no magic is involved).
4. **Related Expertise.** For the next hour, you may add half your proficiency bonus to any Intelligence or Wisdom check that doesn�t already include your proficiency bonus.
5. **Relevant Tidbit.** You recall some important bit of information relevant to the target.
6. **View Auras.** For 1 minute, you gain the benefits of *detect magic* against targets related to your check.

Critical Failure

1. **Aggressive Handling.** If you are examining something, you either break it or worsen a creature�s attitude towards you (as Gossip, page 416). When this does not apply, reroll.
2. **Arcane Fatigue.** You lose one of your highest level spell slots. When this does not apply, reroll.
3. **Boring Topic.** You find this topic incredibly boring. For the next 24 hours, you take a �2 penalty on checks against similar targets.
4. **Earworm.** You are trying to concentrate but all you can remember is an annoying tune. For the next hour, you cannot gain expertise dice on Intelligence and Wisdom checks.
5. **Frightening Revelation.** You become frightened for 1d4+1 rounds. There is no direct source of your fear.
6. **Misinformation.** You are positive of the veracity of some false bit of information.

##### Medicine

Critical Success

1. **Buffer.** The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points last 1 hour.
2. **Comprehensive Checkup.** The target heals 1 level of fatigue or strife (reroll if neither applies).
3. **Expertise.** For the next 24 hours, when making Medicine checks, you can choose to gain a result as if you had rolled a 10 on the die instead of rolling.
4. **Repeat the Procedure.** You may treat your next Medicine check as a natural 20 so long as it is made before you complete a long rest. This does not result in a critical success.
5. **Spur Natural Healing.** The target�s natural healing improves dramatically. For the next 24 hours, double the hit points the target regains from spending Hit Dice during a short rest.
6. **Superb Healing.** The target regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

Critical Failure

1. **Amputate Toe.** You accidentally amputate the patient�s little toe (or similar non-vital extremity). Now, how did you do that?
2. **Disgusting Procedure.** You and the target are poisoned for 1 minute.
3. **Harm.** The target takes 1d4 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
4. **Infect Wound.** The target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or becomes infected with sewer plague.
5. **Open Wound.** The target takes 1 ongoing damage for 1 minute. Each turn the target can use its bonus action to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 20 � 1 per previous save) to stop the bleeding. Any amount of magical healing also stops the bleeding.
6. **Organ Damage.** The target suffers one level of fatigue (Narrator�s choice).

# Adventuring

## Time

The shortest span of game time is a round, which takes place during combat and other situations where time is of the essence. A round lasts 6 seconds.

Minutes are the second most common. Most involved actions, such as exploring a room, take a length of time using minutes. Hours are appropriate for exploring a city or a limited area of land. Days are generally used for long periods of time during a journey or adventure.

## Movement

When it comes to determining movement, the most important factors are the **Speed** of an individual or party and the **terrain** being traversed.

##### Speed

Every creature capable of movement has a Speed, measured in feet, that it can move in a single round. Travel pace is used when it comes to longer time periods of movement that take place over minutes, hours, or days.

Vehicles

Land-based vehicles can choose at which pace to move while water-based vehicles are restricted by the speed of the vehicle. A water-based vehicle gains no benefits from a slow pace, but has no penalties for moving at a fast pace. Depending on the vehicle and crew size, a ship can travel up to 24 hours a day.

##### Special Movement

Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

Movement using these three methods is similar to traveling through difficult terrain though there are some key differences. First, it costs a creature an extra foot to move for every foot spent. Worse, if a creature is moving in actual difficult terrain, it costs two feet to move for every foot spent. Moving by climbing or swimming through normal terrain by a creature with the corresponding speed costs no additional movement.

A Narrator may apply additional checks in certain scenarios, such as climbing a particularly slippery surface or swimming in churning water.

Jumping

The distance a creature can jump is determined both by the method attempted and their Strength score.

A **running long jump** requires a creature to move at least 10 feet by foot immediately before making its jump and the distance covered is a number of feet up to its Strength score. Each foot covered by a jump costs the same in movement. A standing long jump allows a creature to jump up to half its Strength score.

A Narrator can also request a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear low obstacles, which must be no taller than a quarter of the jump�s distance. A failure indicates that instead of jumping over such an obstacle, a creature crashes into it.

Landing is also a fair challenge. Should a creature land in difficult terrain, the creature must make an additional DC 10 Dexterity

(Acrobatics) check to land on its feet. Should it fail, it falls prone.

A **high jump** is a bit more complex. To make a running high jump, a creature must move 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump, clearing a number of feet equal to 3 + its Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet). To make a standing high jump, a creature need not move beforehand, but only jumps half the distance it would have doing a running high jump.

When a creature�s jumping distance exceeds its Speed, it can jump up to a distance equal to twice its Speed in a single leap so long as it takes no other movement on that turn other than to move up to 10 feet beforehand and make the jump. In either case, a creature uses up a foot of movement for every foot it covers jumping.

There are a few special scenarios for high jumping.

First, a creature can raise its arms up to half its height during a jump. Thus a jumping creature can reach the height of the jump plus 1.5 times its height. In addition, the Narrator may allow a creature to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than it could otherwise.

##### Traveling

Marching Order

When it�s relevant to the game, the Narrator should have the party establish who is in the lead (and therefore the most likely to be targeted if a trap is triggered) and who is in the back (the first targeted in a flanking ambush). When it isn�t an important element to what�s currently happening in the game, whichever character is taking the lead on roleplaying is assumed to be in front of their companions.

Encounters and Threats

Whether or not creatures notice a hidden threat is determined by their passive Perception scores.

When players encounter other characters or creatures while traveling, either party can choose to attack, talk, flee, or wait. In addition, a Narrator can decide whether or not a party is surprised by the other if combat ensues.

Stealth

A party looking to avoid threats can choose to travel at a slow pace and employ stealth, making a group Stealth check, typically using Dexterity. A party with reasonable cover can do more than avoid ambushes�they may well surprise or sneak past their enemies.

## The Environment

##### Falling

When a creature falls, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it falls (maximum 20d6) and lands prone.

A creature that falls into water takes half damage, or no damage if it dives with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to the distance it falls divided by 5).

##### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for 1 plus its Constitution modifier minutes (minimum of 30 seconds). Once a creature is out of breath, it begins suffocating. After suffocating for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round), at the start of its turn the suffocating creature drops to 0 hit points and is dying. It

cannot regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

##### Underwater

A creature that cannot breathe water begins to suffocate underwater once it cannot hold its breath. In addition, creatures without swim speeds have disadvantage on attacks made using any weapon other than a dagger, dueling dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss beyond their normal range underwater, and bludgeoning and fire damage are halved. A creature that takes damage while holding its breath underwater must succeed on a concentration check or immediately begin suffocating as if its breath had run out.

##### Vision and Light

Most creatures rely on sight for even the most mundane, everyday tasks.

Adventurers are no different, and the amount of light in a given area impacts their ability to perform both in and out of combat.

A **lightly obscured** area is one that creates a minimal, but not insignificant, amount of visual impairment. When within this area, creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.

An area that is **heavily obscured** obstructs vision completely. A creature in this area is considered blind.

Three types of lighting exist within an area: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

Most creatures suffer no penalties from being in an area of **bright light**.

**Dim light** creates a lightly obscured area. An area of **darkness** is heavily obscured.

Blindsight

A creature with blindsight is not affected by darkness or other heavily or lightly obscured areas, and can see through invisibility, within a certain radius. Creatures adapted to the darkness or creatures without eyes have blindsight.

**Figments.** Creatures that do not rely on visual sight, noted as having blindsight (blind beyond this range), are immune to visual illusions (such as those created by *minor illusion*).

Darkvision

Some creatures have darkvision within a certain radius. Darkvision allows a creature to see within darkness as if it were dim light, and dim light as if it were bright light, though the creature cannot perceive colors while in darkness, only shades of gray.

Truesight

Some especially powerful creatures have truesight. This allows a creature to see in darkness (both mundane and magical), perceive invisible creatures and objects, automatically recognize illusions and succeed on its saving throw against them, and discern the true form of a shapechanger or a magically transformed creature. A creature with truesight can also see into the Ethereal Plane.

## Objects

##### Interacting with Objects

Most physical interactions with the environment simply require a player to announce their intentions to the Narrator. Some interactions, however, may require an ability check. The Narrator sets the DC for

the check based on the difficulty of the task. A Strength check can also be used to break an object. The Narrator sets the DC for the check.

Creatures can damage objects with both physical attacks and spells. Objects are immune to psychic and poison damage, and the Narrator determines any other resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities, as well as an object�s AC and hit points.

Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, but are immune to effects that require other saves. Reducing an object to 0 hit points breaks the object.

Armor Class

An object�s Armor Class represents how tough the object is to damage. The Object Armor Class table has suggested values for objects based on the materials they are made from.

**TABLE: OBJECT AC**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **OBJECT** | **ARMOR CLASS** |
| Cloth, paper, rope | AC 11 |
| Crystal, glass, ice | AC 13 |
| Wood, bone | AC 15 |
| Stone | AC 17 |
| Iron, steel | AC 19 |
| Mithral | AC 21 |
| Adamantine | AC 23 |

Hit Points

An object�s hit points determine how much damage it can take before it is destroyed. A particularly sturdy object (resilient) might have more hit points than more delicate objects (fragile). The Object Hit Points table has suggested hit points for objects based on their size.

**TABLE: OBJECT HIT POINTS**

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **OBJECT** | **SIZE** | **HIT POINTS**  **(FRAGILE**  **)** | **HIT POINTS (RESILIENT)** |
| Game piece, vial | Tiny | 2 (1d4) | 5 (2d4) |
| Chair, painting | Small | 3 (1d6) | 10 (3d6) |
| Crate, |  |  |  |
| Medium | Mediu | 4 (1d8) | 18 (4d8) |
| door, | m |  |  |
| table |  |  |  |
| Large |  |  |  |
| door, |  |  |  |
| 10 ft. � | Large | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |
| 10 ft. |  |  |  |
| section of |  |  |  |
| wall |  |  |  |

Huge and Gargantuan Objects

Against a castle wall or treasure vault door, a hammer or sword won�t get the job done�but determined creatures might try just the same. If the Narrator decides a Huge or Gargantuan object is vulnerable to a creature�s attacks, divide it into separate smaller sections that are each Large-sized and track the hit points of each section independently.

Objects and Damage Types

When damaging an object some damage types might be more effective than others, depending on the object�s composition. For example, wooden objects might be vulnerable to fire. The Narrator determines the effectiveness of any given attack on an object.

Damage Threshold

Objects built to endure attack often have an extra measure of protection: a damage threshold. If an object has a damage threshold it is immune to damage unless an attack or effect deals damage equal to or greater than the damage threshold. Any attack or effect that deals damage less than the damage threshold instead deals no damage at all.

## Social Interaction

##### Ability Checks

Roleplaying can affect an NPC�s attitude or demeanor, but the Narrator may decide an ability check is warranted to determine the outcome of a conversation or social interaction. While Charisma is the ability utilized in most social interactions, other abilities may come into play. When approaching a social situation, your party should consider the character best equipped to handle each interaction the same way you�d approach a role in combat.

## Resting

##### Short Rest

A **short rest** is a period of no less than an hour, in which the character performs light activities like reading, writing, talking, eating, and binding wounds. At the end of a short rest, a character can expend one or more of their Hit Dice to restore any lost hit points. For each Hit Die expended, the player rolls the dice (as determined by their class) and adds their Constitution modifier. A player can decide to roll an additional Hit Die after each roll.

##### Long Rest

A **long rest** is a period of at least 8 hours, 6 of which must be spent asleep. The remaining hours can be spent doing light activity like eating or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted for more than an hour, for instance by walking, fighting, or casting spells, the characters gain no benefit and the time period resets.

After a long rest has been completed, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains a number of expended Hit Dice equal to half of their total number of Hit Dice (minimum of 1).

A character cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the long rest to benefit from it. Any character that does not consume at least 1 Supply suffers a level of fatigue when they finish a long rest, and adventurers are only able to truly recuperate within a haven (see Exploration). A character recovers from one level of fatigue and one level of strife after finishing a long rest in a haven where they have consumed Supply. When taking a long rest and consuming Supply without a haven, a character can recover only from the first level of fatigue or strife.

##### Roughing It

If any of the following conditions apply to you during a long rest, you regain half the usual number of hit dice. Should you have any levels of fatigue or strife, neither is reduced upon finishing the long rest.

* Slept in medium or heavy armor other than hide.
* Slept without a bedroll or similar bedding on rocky, wet, or uneven terrain.
* Slept exposed to the elements during inclement weather conditions.
* Slept without warmth in an environment of extreme cold.
* Slept without mosquito netting or similar precautions while in a swampy or otherwise

insect-ridden area.

Some adventurers, such as rangers, may have features which allow them to ignore the effects of roughing it.

## Between Adventures

##### Lifestyle

A character�s lifestyle (poor, moderate, or rich) impacts some of their downtime activities.

An adventurer�s lifestyle can also impact their interactions with those around them. The Narrator may provide advantage or disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks made against people that perceive a PC to be of a different lifestyle than themselves, depending upon the circumstances.

##### Downtime Activities

Downtime activities represent specific and intentional activities that a character undertakes to achieve a benefit. A character can undertake one downtime activity per week of downtime, although they do not necessarily occur sequentially.

A downtime period consists of 5 days (treated as a week) each involving at least 8 hours engaging in a downtime activity. In most cases, an unfinished week does not count towards progress, but in some situations the Narrator might allow specific

days to add to the total. At the end of each downtime period, any check required is made and success or failure is determined. Some downtime activities may require more than 1 week to complete. If a downtime activity mentions a month it assumes 4 weeks.

**Extended Downtime.** When a party of adventurers is experiencing a particularly long period of downtime, such as a year or longer, the Narrator may extend the length of the downtime period to 1 month and allow players to roll one check per 4 weeks of downtime activity. A success on an extended downtime check is treated as 4 successful weeks of a downtime activity, a failure is treated as 2 successful weeks, and on a failure by 5 or more the character makes no progress at the downtime activity.

For even longer periods of downtime, the Narrator can extend the downtime to seasons (treating a success as 12 weeks, a failure as 6 weeks, and a failure by 5 or more as 3 weeks), or even years (treating a success as 52 weeks, a failure as 26 weeks, and a failure by 5 or more as 13 weeks).

Characters may wish to work together to complete downtime activities. At the Narrator�s discretion, one character may assist another (as the Help action). Both characters must spend their downtime on the chosen activity.

Craft

Adventurers with tool proficiencies may use their downtime to create weapons, armor, or other items. The Craft activity can be used to create weapons, armor, tools, clothing, other equipment, or a work of art.

All crafted items require materials. Poor quality items can be made with materials equal to 1/8th the base cost of the item that

the character wishes to create. Normal quality work requires materials equal to 1/4th the base cost. If a character wishes to craft a fine item, they must acquire fine materials equal to 1/2 the item�s base cost. If a character wishes to craft a masterwork item, the materials cost is equal to the base cost of the item.

**Special Materials.** Rarely a smith might happen upon special materials. These materials can only rarely be purchased and must often be found. When attempting to craft using adamantine, mithral, or other wondrous materials, increase the DC to craft the item by 2.

**Time Required.** The time required varies depending upon what a character is attempting to craft, as per Table: Crafting Time. At the end of the required time, the character makes a check based upon the desired quality level. On a success, the materials are consumed and they create the item. On a failure, they create an item of one quality level lower than they desired or may salvage the materials. When a character fails by 5 or more, they produce a poor quality item and the materials are consumed.

**Quality.** The quality of an item affects the time, cost, and difficulty of crafting it. Items of fine quality or masterwork quality also offer special benefits. A fine item also costs an additional 25 gold to produce, and a masterwork item 125 gold.

**Engineering.** The Craft downtime activity can also be used for buildings, engineering devices, and other projects. Each check requires a week of work and access to an amount of gold worth of materials. The DC and materials cost are determined by the project�s complexity.

The scope of the project determines how many checks are required to complete it.

| Monumental\* | 128+ | A dam, a massive clocktower, an airship port, a palace |

\*Projects of this size often require a team of assistants and laborers.

Gather Information

The Gather Information activity is used to uncover secure or secret information about individuals, events, organizations, or other things that still exist within living memory. Gather Information is typically done by word-of-mouth on the street or in taverns.

The character specifies a particular individual, event, organization, or place from which they wish to learn more or declares a specific piece of information that they�re seeking to learn, making an Investigation check. The time, DC, and costs are included below.

On a success, the character learns what they are looking for along with a point of Key Knowledge. Success by 5 or more grants an additional fact or useful piece of information and an additional point of Key Knowledge. Failure means that the character learns nothing, and on a failure by 5 or more they instead learn an incorrect

piece of information that could lead them astray or cause some trouble.

**Key Knowledge.** Key Knowledge represents clues, secrets, or other insights into a particular location, individual, or event. Each point of Key Knowledge is specific to an individual, creature, or location. These points may be spent to gain advantage on an attack roll or ability check made in relation to the subject.

At the Narrator�s discretion, these points can also be spent to introduce a small fact to the story.

**Limitations.** The Narrator may decide that there is simply no way that a piece of information can be gleaned by the Gather Information activity. In this case, the Narrator should inform the player before the check is attempted.

**TABLE: GATHER INFORMATION**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **OBSCURITY** | **DC** | **TIME** | **COST** | **EXAMPLES** |
| Uncommon | 10 | 1 week | 10 gp | The bar where a local crime boss conducts business, where a local noble likes to drink |
| Esoteric | 15 | 2 weeks | 25 gp | The name of the best fence in a particular city, where to go to get illicit magic ingredients |
| Hidden | 20 | 3 weeks | 100 gp | The location of the duke�s secret prison, the name of a dragon�s agent in a city |
| Secret | 25 | 5 weeks 500+ gp | | The identity of the leader of a guild of assassins, what the king keeps in the secret room below his chambers |

Recovery

Sometimes it is necessary to recover from the dangers faced by an adventurer. In order to take the Recover activity, a character must have or temporarily pay for at least a moderate lifestyle. Each week that a character takes the Recover activity, they may:

* Make a Constitution saving throw against one effect that is preventing them from regaining hit points.
* Make one additional saving throw against one disease or poison currently affecting them.

If a character is tended to by someone with a healer�s satchel, they have advantage on the above checks.

Religious Devotion

Religious Devotion allows a character to engage in acts of piety in an attempt to appease the gods and earn their favor. In order to engage in this downtime activity, a character must have access to a shrine, temple, or other sacred site and spend the

required gold on sacred offerings to make a Nature or Religion check against a DC from Table: Religious Devotion. On a success, the character gains 1 point of favor, plus 1 additional point of favor for every 5 points their result exceeds the DC.

**Favor.** A point of favor can be spent to represent a minor but helpful boon that aligns with a deity�s portfolio. A point of favor from a war god might allow a character to find a weapon after they�ve been disarmed, while a point of favor from a nature god might make it easier to find a safe place to camp.

The specific details are left up to the Narrator, but in general, this should represent advantage on a roll, the discovery of a small but useful item, or a helpful chance encounter. For 2 favor points, the Narrator may allow a character to benefit from the effects of a 1st-level spell that aligns with a deity�s portfolio.

Narrators are free to come up with other uses.

If a character acts against the interests or philosophy of a deity during an adventure, any points of favor are immediately lost.

**TABLE: RELIGIOUS DEVOTION**

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PHILOSOPHICAL SIMILARITY** | **DC** | **OFFERING\*** | **DESCRIPTION** |
| Strongly Aligned | 10 | 10 gp | The character�s personal ethos and actions closely mirror the deity�s philosophy and teachings. |
| Aligned | 15 | 25 gp | The character�s personal ethos and actions are generally similar to the deity�s philosophy and teachings. |
| Neutral | 20 | 50 gp | The character�s personal ethos and actions do not align with or oppose the deity they are beseeching. |
| Opposed | 25 | 100 gp | The character�s personal ethos and actions are generally counter to the deity�s philosophy and teachings. |
| Strongly Opposed | 30 | 500 gp | The character�s personal ethos and actions run directly counter to the deity�s philosophy and teachings. |

\*The Narrator may allow specific actions by the character to reduce or eliminate this cost.

Research

Research is used to uncover obscure information about individuals, events, organizations, or other things that have faded beyond living memory but still exist in recorded history. Alternatively, Research can be used to find facts or information contained within bureaucratic records.

In order to conduct the Research activity, a character must have access to a library or libraries that might conceivably contain the information that they are searching for. The character makes an Arcana or History check (determined by the topic of Research) against the DC listed on Table: Research, taking an appropriate amount of time and spending the indicated amount of gold.

On a success, they learn what they are looking for along with a point of Key Knowledge (see Gather Information).

Success by 5 or more grants an additional

fact or useful piece of information and an additional point of Key Knowledge. Failure means that the character learns nothing, and on a failure by 5 or more they instead learn an incorrect piece of information that could lead them astray or cause some trouble.

The cost of research is reflective of bribes, library fees, and other related expenses. At the Narrator�s discretion, a character may dispense with these if they already have access to a library that might contain the information.

**TABLE: RESEARCH**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **OBSCURITY** | **DC** | **TIME** | **COST\*** | **EXAMPLES** |
| Uncommon | 10 | 1 week | 10 gp | The original name of a particular village |
| Esoteric | 15 | 2 weeks | 25 gp | The original owner of a piece of land or business, the location of an ancient tomb |
| Hidden | 20 | 3 weeks | 100 gp | The true history of the founding of a dynasty, the real lineage of the local ruler |
| Secret | 25 | 5 weeks | 500+ gp | The name of a fiend, the location of a city destroyed by the gods in the last age |

Spellcraft

This downtime activity allows spellcasters to create rare spells by refining their knowledge. Pick a common version of a spell that the character knows and choose one modification from the modifications table. Alternatively, with the Narrator�s permission a character may choose one rare spell provided it is of a level they can cast.

The character makes an ability check using their spellcasting ability and Arcana (sorcerer, warlock, wizard), Nature (druid), Performance (bard), or Religion (cleric, herald). The DC of the check is based on the spell level as per Table: Rare Spell Crafting and is increased by the desired modification.

Each check requires 1 week and the amount of indicated materials. A character requires a number of successful study weeks as listed on Table: Rare Spell Crafting. If a character succeeds the check by 5 or more, that week counts as 2 weeks for the purposes of completion. On a failure, the character makes no progress that week and the materials are consumed, and on a failure by 5 or more the materials are consumed and a week of progress is lost.

The rare spell is finished when the final check succeeds.

In order to invent a rare spell, a character must have access to the appropriate type of library. Wizards and sorcerers require a collection of arcane tomes. Clerics and heralds must have access to books of esoteric lore and theological texts. Druids need a sacred place of nature untouched by civilization. Bards utilize folios of magical compositions. Warlocks require forbidden texts and works of the occult.

Creating rare spells should be a collaboration with the Narrator. As always, the Narrator must approve any new rare spell. When in doubt, use preexisting rare spell effects for inspiration.

In addition to crafting rare spells, it is possible to create entirely new spells. This process typically requires years of work and often represents the pinnacle of a spellcaster�s career. If a character wishes to create their own spell, it should require at least 2 months per spell level and 500 gold per spell level each week. DCs for such checks and the other specifics are determined by the Narrator, using the rules for crafting rare spells as a guideline.

**TABLE: RARE SPELL MODIFICATIONS**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MODIFICATION** | **DC MODIFIER** | **EFFECT** |
| Altered Effect | +0 | The spell�s primary effect is changed. This can be used to add or alter a spell�s damage type, affect what the spell targets, or otherwise modify its core effect. Examples include an *invisibility* spell that targets objects instead of creatures, a *fireball* that deals cold damage, or a *lightning bolt* that has a cone area. |
| Lingering Effect | +1 | The spell has a secondary effect that occurs after the spell has ended. Examples include a *fireball* that causes the target to take ongoing fire damage or a *slow* spell that leaves a target fatigued after its duration has ended. |
| Additional Effect | +2 | An additional effect is added to the spell�s primary function. Examples include an *ice storm* that freezes a target in place for the duration. |
| Additional Target | +2 | This spell has the means to target additional creatures. Examples include a paralyzing effect that spreads by touch or a *suggestion* to new targets through conversation. |

**TABLE: RARE SPELL CRAFTING**

Train

The Train activity allows a character to learn a new weapon, language, or tool proficiency, or it can be used to swap a class feature or feat that they learned previously.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SPELL LEVEL** | **DC** | **COST PER WEEK** | **SUCCESSFUL STUDY WEEKS** |
| 1st | 15 | 100 gp | 2 |
| 2nd | 16 | 150 gp | 3 |
| 3rd | 17 | 200 gp | 4 |
| 4th | 18 | 300 gp | 5 |
| 5th | 19 | 500 gp | 6 |
| 6th | 20 | 1,000 gp | 7 |
| 7th | 21 | 1,500 gp | 8 |
| 8th | 22 | 3,000 gp | 9 |
| 9th | 23 | 5,000 gp | 10 |

**Language or Tool.** Learning a new language or tool proficiency requires a character to spend a number of months equal to 12 � their Intelligence modifier and pay 50 gold pieces per month to retain a tutor. If a character does not wish to pay for or does not have access to a tutor, they must have another reliable means of learning and the time required is doubled. At the end of this period, the character acquires the proficiency.

**Weapon.** Learning a new weapon proficiency requires a character spend a number of months equal to 6 � their

Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is highest) training and pay 50 gold pieces per month to retain a tutor. At the end of this time period, the character acquires the weapon proficiency.

**Relearning.** A character may also relearn class features. This activity does not require spending any gold. The time required is 1 week to change a feature gained at 1st�5th level, 2 weeks to change a feature gained at 6th�10th level, 3 weeks to change a feature gained at 11th�15th level, and 4 weeks to change a feature gained at 15th�20th level. This activity cannot be used to swap out spells that have been entered into a spellbook.

**Feat.** To swap a feat gained through leveling to another feat, a character may spend a number of months equal to 8 � their proficiency bonus and pay 50 gold pieces each month to acquire practice materials and advice from experts in the feat they are learning.

**Archetype.** A character can change to a different archetype for their class by spending 12 weeks mastering the new archetype, at which point they are able to select it. When they do, any class features gained from their previous archetype are lost and replaced by the class features of their new archetype.

Changing from one class to another requires the use of powerful reality- altering magic (like the *wish* spell or the direct intervention of a deity).

Work

A character can use the Work activity to pay their cost of living expenses and earn some coin between adventures. Work is broken down into two categories. On a successful check after spending a week on this

downtime activity, a character supports a lifestyle (poor, moderate, or rich, and earns gold as listed on Table: Work.

**Legal Work.** Legal work allows a character to practice a trade or profession without fear of consequence. The character selects a tool proficiency or skill approved by the Narrator and makes an ability check, consulting Table: Work to determine the lifestyle their profits support and the extra gold earned. On a result of 5 or less, a character earns nothing, supports no lifestyle, and has disadvantage on the next Work check that they make using the same skill or tool.

**Illegal Work.** Illegal work allows a character to sustain themself and make some coin by engaging in petty crime. First, a character selects the type of crime that they would like to engage in and selects an appropriate skill or ability check approved by the Narrator. They then select the difficulty of criminal activities as per Table: Work.

On a failed check, a character receives no earnings and must cover the cost of their lifestyle themselves. If they fail by 5 or more, the character must lay low and cannot take a downtime activity for the following week, and on a failure by 10 or more they are caught and suffer consequences or complications determined by the Narrator.

**TABLE: WORK**

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DIFFICULTY** | **DC** | **LIFESTYLE** | **EARNINGS** |
| Easy | 10 | poor | 1d6 gp |
| Average | 15 | moderate | 3d6 gp |
| Hard | 20 | rich | 6d6 gp |
| Very Hard | 25 | rich | 10d6 gp |

**TABLE: PRESTIGE RATING**

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RATIN G** | **WELL- KNOWN ACROSS** | **CAN GET**  **AUDIENC E WITH** | **NOTORIETY** |
| 0 | Unknown | Nobody | The character is viewed with disdain, as a buffoon or pariah. People do not take them seriously. |
| 1 | Local | Shopkeep | The character is relatively unknown, but some local folks know them. |
| 2 | Village | Guard captain | The character has done a few noteworthy things, but most people don�t know them or assume they won�t do anything else interesting. |
| 3 | Town | Mayor | The character has become known across town, or across a district of a city. |
| 4 | City | Minor noble | The character is known across an entire city, or a single town plus its immediate environs. |
| 5 | Region | Noble | The character has distinguished themself across the region, and most influential people know about their actions and talents. |
| 6 | Country | Powerful noble | The character is known all across the land. People pay close attention to them, either viewing them as a powerful ally or a dangerous enemy. |
| 7 | Continent | Monarch | The character is well known by those in more than one country. Monarchs and important rulers typically have this level of Prestige. |
| 8 | World | Emperor | The character is one of the most famous people in the world, known well to monarchs and powerful figures. A lot of resources are devoted to either helping them out or taking them down. |
| 9 | Plane | Minor deity | The character is known not just on this world, but on other worlds on the same plane of existence. They might have saved or threatened the entire world. |
| 10 | Multiverse | Greater deity | The character is known not just across the world, but by powerful beings on other planes. |
| 11 | Multiverse | Greater deity | When the character seeks the audience of powerful beings like gods they are noticed. |
| 12 | Multiverse | Greater deity | When the character seeks the audience of powerful beings like gods they are answered. |
| 13 Multiverse Pantheon When the character seeks the audience of powerful beings like  gods they are answered in a timely manner. | | | |

14+ Divine Anybody This level of Prestige is usually the province of deities and other

powerful extraplanar beings. The character is widely known on multiple worlds or planes.

## Prestige Rating

A character�s Prestige rating represents how prominent they are, either as an ally or enemy, and can influence how easy it is for the character to call in favors from their allies, or determine how much effort their enemies will put into defeating them. Most Prestige ratings range from 0 to 6, although some deities and extraplanar beings may have higher ratings.

Player characters start with a Prestige rating of 1. Each time a character enters a new tier of play at 5th, 11th, and 17th level their Prestige rating increases by 1.

Additionally, characters may gain Prestige when acquiring a stronghold, and the Narrator may award Prestige when they accomplish great deeds during play. Finally, some class features may grant Prestige bonuses.

Additionally, Prestige determines how many followers a character can have at any one time. This number is equal to the character�s Prestige rating.

**Prestige Center.** A character�s Prestige rating distinguishes how widely known they are. If they travel beyond their home, the character may find that people do not know who they are. Prestige applies in an area whose size is determined by a character�s Prestige score, starting from as small as a village to as large as an entire world. When creating a character, the player should work with the Narrator to determine where their Prestige is centered from. Often this will be the starting area of a campaign.

**Prestige Check.** To determine whether somebody has heard of a character, or to call in a favor (see below), the character makes a Prestige check by rolling 1d20 and adding their Prestige rating. The DC of a Prestige check is equal to 12 + double the tier of the region the character is in (or when extremely far from their Prestige Center, triple the tier). When outside the area described by their Prestige rating, the character has disadvantage.

# Combat &

Turn-Based Action

## When to Use

Turn-Based Action

Turn-Based Action can be called when a hostile action is taken, when the characters enter a precarious location or situation, or at the start of a competition. Whenever methodical actions are necessary from multiple characters at the same time, this system presents the scene in a way that ensures everyone gets the spotlight.

## Turn Order

All engagements using Turn-Based Action consist of two phases: set-up and initiative rounds. The set-up phase establishes the status and order of the participants and the amount of time each round takes in the game world. During initiative rounds, participants take their turns round after round until one side is victorious.

Set-Up

1. **Set the Scene.** The Narrator determines where everyone is located, the appropriate amount of time for each round, and any important conditions of the engagement.
2. **Surprise.** If any characters intend to act before all participants are aware of the encounter, the Narrator calls for ability checks to determine if any combatants are surprised.
3. **Roll Initiative.** The remaining participants roll initiative and determine the turn order.

Initiative Rounds

1. **World Actions.** If the environment features any world bonuses or penalties with an active element, it occurs at the start of a round before the participants take their turns.
2. **On Your Turn.** The active character moves and uses their available actions.
3. **Off Your Turn.** The inactive characters plan their next turn and react to the active character�s actions.
4. **End of Round.** When everyone has taken their turn, the initiative round repeats at step 1 until the encounter concludes.

##### Setting the Scene

The Narrator establishes the conditions of any Turn-Based Action encounter. This includes the known participants and their positions, any active elements and known world bonuses or penalties in the environment, and the length of each round.

A round encompasses the semi-simultaneous actions of the

participants within a period of game-world time. In combat, one round is usually 6 seconds. In other cases a round might last 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes, as deemed appropriate by the Narrator.

##### Surprise & Sudden Actions

If some participants are unaware of others due to successful attempts to be stealthy, they begin the encounter surprised. The

Narrator calls for appropriate ability checks to determine whether participants are aware of each other. Surprised creatures are unable to move or take an action on their first turn, and they can�t use a reaction until after their first turn.

Sometimes all participants are aware of each other at the start of an encounter, but one side takes an action or launches an attack while others� guards are down. In this case, no one is surprised, but the Narrator might allow the instigating creature or party to roll initiative (see below) with advantage.

If nobody is trying to be sneaky, combat begins normally with initiative as described below.

##### Initiative

**TABLE: TYPES OF INITIATIVE**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Wisdom (Perception) | Spotting a hidden threat |
| Strength (Athletics) | Climbing a cliff during a landslide |
| Charisma (Deception) | Being unassuming before suddenly taking action |
| Wisdom (Insight) | Noticing when an unassuming  participant is about to take action |
| Dexterity  (Land Vehicles) | Participating in a wagon race |

The initiative step sets the order of everyone�s turn throughout the encounter. Each participant makes an ability check to determine their place in the initiative count, from the highest check total to the lowest. This ability check is typically Dexterity. The Narrator might determine that one or more

participants should instead roll a different ability check, potentially utilizing a relevant skill or tool (see Table: Types of Initiative). In the event of a tie, the tied participants each roll a d20 to determine the order amongst themselves (the highest roll goes first.)

If any creatures have already made an ability check during the surprise step, they use that existing score for initiative.

##### World Actions

The battlefield itself can be as active a participant in Turn-Based Action as the characters are, and its actions can have serious consequences for everyone involved.

Some world bonuses and penalties have an effect that activates within the initiative count. These world actions occur at the start of each round before any participants act.

The Narrator determines if any participants are within the range of these effects and adjudicates the action accordingly.

The World Bonuses and Penalties section later in this chapter provides more details and examples of world actions.

##### On Your Turn

When it�s your turn, you can move a distance up to your Speed and take your actions. You can declare your intent for your turn in any order, breaking up your movement between actions or using your bonus action first. You can also choose to do absolutely nothing.

Within a single round, you can take an action, a bonus action, and any free actions (like communicating with allies, dismissing the effect of a *thaumaturgy* cantrip you have already cast, or interacting with an object) during your turn, and one reaction at any time. After using a reaction, you can't do so again until at the start of your turn.

The rules for actions and movement are found in the Actions in Combat and Movement and Position below.

##### Off Your Turn

You�re still an active participant in

Turn-Based Action even when it�s not your turn! You have a number of responsibilities to keep track of within an encounter in between taking actions.

1. *Plan your actions so you�re ready when your turn comes.* In particular, characters that can cast spells have a lot of options to manage, and you might not want to spend your precious 6 seconds flipping through a book.
2. *Pay attention to the encounter beyond events that involve you.* The priorities of you and your allies can change in the blink of an eye, and the actions you were planning can become inappropriate for the task.
3. *Be prepared to use your reaction.* Reactions have specific conditions that can occur at any time and you don�t want to let a golden opportunity escape your grasp.

##### End of Round

Once all participants have taken their turn, the encounter returns to the start of a new round. The loop persists until the action concludes or the granularity of Turn-Based Action is no longer needed.

## Movement and Position

You can move a distance up to your Speed on your turn. With that in mind, how you

choose to move and how much movement you use are all up to you.

##### Size and Space

Creatures and objects come in all different shapes and sizes. To determine the amount of space one can effectively command, Table: Size Categories approximates a standard for Turn-Based Action.

The 5-foot square that a Medium creature commands can�t be passed through by other Medium creatures unless the creature allows them to. Likewise, the space determines the limit to the number of creatures that can surround it; a Medium creature can be surrounded by a maximum of 8 Medium creatures, or 4 Large creatures.

**TABLE: SIZE CATEGORIES**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SIZE** | **SPACE** | **SURROUNDING CREATURES** |
| Tiny | 2-� ft. by 2-� ft. | 8 |
| Small | 5 ft. by 5 ft. | 8 |
| Mediu m | 5 ft. by 5 ft. | 8 |
| Large | 10 ft. by 10 ft. | 12 |
| Huge | 15 ft. by 15 ft. | 16 |
| Gargan tuan | 20 ft. by 20 ft. | 20 |
| Titanic | 25 ft. by 25 ft. or larger | 24 or more |

Squeezing

A creature usually has the option to squeeze through a space one size smaller than its own.

**While you are squeezing:**

* + Your movement speed is halved.
  + You have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and Dexterity saving throws.
  + Ability checks and attack rolls made against you have advantage.

##### Movement in Turn-Based Action

Your Speed centers around moving across the ground by running, walking, rolling, slithering, and so on. Any natural or magical means can provide you with additional speeds based on other forms of movement.

**Climbing and Swimming.** You can use your base Speed to perform these tasks, but you must spend 1 extra foot for every foot you move. A swim or climb speed allows you to move in those ways at no additional cost.

**Gliding, Hovering, and Burrowing.** You must have the appropriate movement speed to perform these tasks.

**Flying.** Not only do you need to have a fly speed to fly, you might fall out of the sky if you are knocked prone or if your Speed is reduced to 0.

When switching between different movement speeds, you subtract the distance you�ve already moved during your turn from the new speed. If the difference is 0 or less, you can�t use the new speed this turn.

The way you break up your movement between speeds is up to you. If you have two attacks and a Speed of 30 feet, you can move 15 feet, perform an attack, move another 15 feet, and then attack a second time. If you have more than one movement speed, like a swim speed of 30 feet, you can run 10 feet, swim across a pool for 10

feet, and then run another 10 feet on the other side.

Mounted Combat

A creature can ride on top of another creature at least one size larger than its own, provided the bigger creature can support its weight. Mounting or dismounting a creature costs half your movement and can be performed once per turn.

**While you are mounted on a creature:**

* + You have half cover (+2 to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide) against melee attacks.
  + You have advantage on ability checks to leap off the creature you�re riding.
  + If you are knocked prone, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the creature you�re riding.
  + If the creature you�re riding is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount and land on your feet. Otherwise, you also fall prone.

**While you are being ridden by another creature:**

* + You have advantage on ability checks to throw the creature riding you.

If you�re riding another creature that you have control of, you use its Speed instead of your own, and you and your mount share movement on your turn. When moving after you�ve jumped onto or off the creature,

remember that mounting or dismounting costs half your Speed .

A mounted creature under your control can take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action during your movement on your turn.

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to command the creature to make an ability check or take the Attack action (this does not include Multiattack). You can read more about these actions later in this chapter.

Being Prone

You can drop prone on your turn without using any movement. You can also drop prone as a reaction to being targeted by a ranged attack you can see.

**While you are prone:**

* + Your only movement option is to crawl until you stand up. While crawling, every 1 foot of movement costs 1 extra foot.
  + You have disadvantage on melee attack rolls.
  + An attack roll against you is made with advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet. Otherwise, the attack roll is made with disadvantage.
  + Standing up from prone uses half your movement.

##### Tactical Positioning

Attacking From Above

If you are at least 5 feet above your target and you aren�t grappled or restrained, you gain an expertise die on melee attack rolls made against it.

Back-To-Back

When you are within 5 feet of an ally, you can use a bonus action to stand

back-to-back. While back-to-back with an ally, it is harder to be caught off guard, and you cannot be flanked. As long as neither you nor your ally move, your passive Perception is increased by 2 until either the start of your next turn or when one of you moves.

Dragging An Ally

While within 5 feet of a willing ally, you can use your reaction to grab them and pull them along with your movement, even if they�ve already expended all of theirs. While doing so, every foot of movement costs you an additional 2 feet of movement, and the ally can�t use their reaction. This movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal.

Flanking

When you and an ally are on direct opposite sides of a target, you gain an expertise die on attack rolls and ability checks against that target. You and your ally can�t flank for one another if either of you are incapacitated. If you�re not using a grid for combat, flanking instead occurs when three or more creatures are attacking the same creature in melee.

Pulling From Below

If you are at least 5 feet below your target, your target is your size or smaller, and you aren�t grappled or restrained, you gain an expertise die on Strength-based checks and saving throws made against it.

## Actions in Combat

For your action on your turn, you can use one of the following options, an action gained from your class, magic item, or trait, or an action that you improvise. Monsters have additional action options described in their statistics.

When you want to perform an action not detailed here, the Narrator determines whether the action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make (if any) to determine if you succeed or fail.

##### Attack

Attacks are either melee attacks or ranged attacks. See the �Making an Attack� section for details on this action. In addition to regular attacks, you can choose to use a special melee attack such as a shove, a disarm, or a grapple. These special melee attacks are described in Combat Maneuvers.

Certain class and monster features, like Extra Attack or Multiattack, allow you to make more than one attack with a single action.

##### Cast a Spell

Many spells have a casting time of an action. Some, though, use a reaction, bonus action, minutes, or hours to cast. See Spellcasting for the rules that govern spells.

##### Dash

When you take the Dash action, your speed is doubled for the current turn (after applying any modifiers). You can�t Dash if you�re suffering fatigue.

##### Disengage

When you take the Disengage action, you take a defensive, guarded retreat, and your movement doesn�t provoke opportunity attacks during that turn.

##### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, until the start of your next turn attacks against you made by creatures you can see are made with disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You can�t take the Dodge action when your Speed is reduced to 0.

##### Help

When you take the Help action, you aid another creature in a task. The creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform that task before the start of your next turn.

You can also help a friendly creature in attacking a creature. The creature must be within 5 feet of you and you must be able to target the creature with an attack, or otherwise threaten it. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, its next attack roll against the target is made with advantage.

##### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the passive Perception scores of creatures able to observe you. If you succeed, you gain the benefits described under Unseen Attackers and Targets.

##### Press the Attack

Before you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to designate one

creature within your reach that isn�t currently the target of a Press the Attack action. Until the start of your next turn, your melee attacks against that creature gain an expertise die, and all attacks against you are made with advantage. You can�t gain expertise dice in this way on attacks made with disadvantage.

When you Press the Attack, your target can use its reaction to Fall Back.

Fall Back

Whenever a creature takes the Press the Attack bonus action against you, you can use your reaction to yield ground.

You move backwards 5 feet, and your attacker does not gain an expertise die against you from using Press the Attack. As part of its action, your attacker can move 5 feet towards you.

Neither you nor the attacker provoke opportunity attacks from this movement.

A creature using the Rage class feature can�t choose to Fall Back.

##### Ready

When you take the Ready action, you prepare an action to be used when a certain triggering circumstance comes to pass. You then choose the action you will take, or decide that you will move up to your Speed, in response to the trigger. When the trigger occurs, you can use your reaction immediately afterwards, or you can decide to ignore the trigger, wasting your readied action.

Only spells with a casting time of 1 action can be readied. When you take the Ready action to cast a spell, you first cast it normally and then concentrate on the spell to be released when the trigger is met (more details on concentration can be found in Spellcasting).

##### Search

Without using the Search action, your passive Investigation and passive Perception scores determine whether you notice a hidden creature or object. Using the Search action gives you an additional chance. Depending on circumstances, the Narrator might call for a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check to Search.

##### Sprint

When you take the Sprint action, you focus all your effort on moving as fast as possible to the exclusion of everything else.

* + You can�t take any other actions, bonus actions, or reactions other than to move your Speed for the turn.
  + If you are unencumbered, your Speed is quadrupled for one turn; if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor, your Speed is tripled for one turn.
  + You must Sprint in a straight line each turn, although you can change direction each time you Sprint.
  + You can Sprint a number of turns equal to your Constitution modifier. Each turn you Sprint after that, you make a Constitution (Athletics) check (DC 10 + 1 per previous check made in the last minute) or you suffer a level of fatigue from either tiredness or a minor sprain or injury. You recover fatigue suffered from sprinting 1 minute after you stop sprinting.
  + You can�t Sprint or Dash if you are suffering from one or more levels of fatigue.
  + Attacks against you are made with advantage until the start of your next turn.

##### Tumble

You can use an action or bonus action to Tumble through a hostile creature�s space by deftly diving or rolling past. Make a Dexterity saving throw against the target�s combat maneuver DC. On a success, you can move through the hostile creature�s space once this turn. If you have proficiency with Acrobatics, you gain an expertise die on the save (or you gain a 1d6 expertise die if you also have the tumbling specialty.) The creature can choose to let you pass, with no save required.

If you�re smaller than the creature, you have advantage on the save. If you�re larger than the creature, you have disadvantage (though if you are two or more sizes larger than the target, you can move through the hostile creature�s space without making a saving throw). You still provoke opportunity attacks if you move beyond a creature�s reach.

##### Use a Basic Maneuver

You can always choose to Disarm, Grapple, Knockdown, Overrun, or Shove as a basic maneuver instead of making an attack. See Combat Maneuvers for the rules that govern basic maneuvers.

##### Use a Combat Maneuver

Many combat maneuvers are used alongside making an attack, but some have their own action costs. See Combat

Maneuvers for the rules that govern combat maneuvers.

##### Use an Object

You can use some objects as part of an action, and you can make a quick interaction with one object for free without spending an action. When using an object is more complex or time consuming, or when you need to use a second object on your turn, you take the Use an Object action.

## Making an Attack

An action is an attack if you are making an attack roll.

1. **Select a Target:** Choose a target within your attack�s reach or range: a creature, an object, or a location in space. Generally, you must have line of sight (a straight line between two points through which light could pass) and line of effect (an unobstructed straight line between two points through which objects could pass) to attack a target, but that can vary (such as when firing an arrow through a glass window, or swinging a sword at where you assume a hidden target is located).
2. **Apply Modifiers:** The Narrator determines whether the target has cover. Certain circumstances, abilities, spells, or effects can apply additional modifiers, advantage, disadvantage, or expertise dice to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the Attack:** You make your attack roll, rolling a d20 and applying your modifier with the bonuses or penalties from above. On a hit, you roll damage and

apply any additional effects of the attack.

##### Attack Rolls

An attack roll is a d20 roll plus appropriate modifiers (usually proficiency bonus and either Strength or Dexterity modifier). If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target�s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. Objects and monsters have their own AC scores, while a character�s AC is determined by their armor, ability scores, features, traits, and magic items.

***Critical Hits and Fumbles.*** A natural 20 on an attack roll is a critical hit and is always successful. On the flip side, rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll is considered a critical fumble and always misses.

##### Modifiers to the Roll

When making an attack roll, a character typically adds an ability modifier and their proficiency bonus to the roll. Monsters and other NPCs use whatever modifier is provided in their statistics (though they typically follow the same formulas).

**Ability Modifier:** Melee attacks use the attacker�s Strength or Dexterity modifier depending on the weapon used, while ranged attacks usually use the attacker�s Dexterity modifier, unless they are thrown.

Spell attacks utilize the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, determined by the class or trait that grants the spell.

**Proficiency Bonus:** You add your proficiency bonus when attacking with a weapon you are proficient with, or when you are attacking with a spell.

Nonproficient attacks don�t add your proficiency bonus.

**Miscellaneous Modifiers:** Sometimes you will gain other modifiers to your roll.

These can come from combat maneuvers, spells, features, traits, or any ability that adds an expertise die. Magical weapons often grant bonuses to attack rolls.

## Unseen Attackers and Targets

When you attack a target you can�t see, but whose location you know, you have disadvantage on your attack roll.

Being unseen doesn�t always mean being hidden; you might know the location of an invisible target that isn�t using the Hide action to move quietly. However, if a target is both unseen and undetected, you must guess what space it occupies. The Narrator will typically say that an attack missed if you guess wrong, so as not to give more information about the target�s location.

Likewise, if your target can�t see you, you have advantage on your attack rolls against it. If you are hidden when you make your attack, you give away your location after making the attack.

In situations where your target is unseen by you and you are unseen by your target (such as if both you and your target are invisible, or if you are fighting in magical darkness), all attack rolls are made at disadvantage.

Some creatures and characters have additional senses, like blindsight, that allow them to sense targets without vision. A creature is only unseen to them if they are unable to perceive it.

## Ranged Attacks

##### Range

Ranged attacks come with a range, and your target must be within that range. If a ranged attack has a single range, you can�t make an attack at a target beyond that range. If a ranged attack has two ranges (a normal range and a long range), attacks made at targets further than the normal range are made at disadvantage, while targets beyond long range can�t be targeted at all.

##### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

When you make a ranged attack while you are within the reach of a hostile creature, you make the attack with disadvantage.

## Melee Attacks

A melee attack is an attack made in

hand-to-hand combat. These can be attacks with manufactured weapons, unarmed attacks, or natural weapons like claws, teeth, or horns. Some spells utilize melee attacks as well.

Most creatures have a reach of 5 feet, allowing them to make melee attacks against any creature within 5 feet of them. Larger creatures, or creatures using reach weapons, can have larger reach (noted in their attack entries).

##### Opportunity Attacks

If someone drops their guard, they open themselves up to attack. Such an attack is called an opportunity attack.

You can use your reaction to attempt an opportunity attack when a hostile creature

you can see moves out of your reach. An opportunity attack is a single melee attack against the provoking creature, made immediately before the creature leaves your reach.

The Disengage action can be used to avoid provoking opportunity attacks.

Movement via teleportation doesn�t provoke opportunity attacks, and unless noted otherwise neither does forced movement (such as if you are pushed away by a creature or effect, or if you move past a creature while falling).

##### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a weapon that doesn�t have the heavy property that you are wielding in one hand, you can use your bonus action to attack with a different, dual-wielding melee weapon that you are holding in your

off-hand. You don�t add your ability modifier to the damage roll of the off-hand attack, unless that modifier is negative. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can make a ranged weapon attack with it instead.

If you have the Extra Attack feature, you can use your bonus action to make two attacks with the weapon in your off-hand.

## Damage and Recovery

##### Hit Points

Hit points represent a creature�s stamina, willpower, and the luck needed to survive deadly challenges. Creatures with a lot of hit points are harder to kill.

A creature�s current hit points can range anywhere from their hit point maximum down to 0. A creature loses hit points when taking damage, subtracting the damage value from current hit points down to a

minimum of 0. It regains hit points when it receives healing, adding hit points up to its hit point maximum.

When a character loses hit points, they aren�t necessarily taking physical harm. Rather they are avoiding otherwise fatal blows, and their ability to keep doing so is whittled away as they take further damage and their hit points decrease.

Loss of hit points has no effect on a creature�s abilities and effectiveness in combat until it drops to 0 hit points.

##### Damage Rolls

Damaging attacks and effects each specify the damage they deal. Damage can be a fixed number or it can be a die or dice plus modifiers. Magic and other factors can grant a bonus, or occasionally a penalty, to damage. With a penalty it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a weapon, you add the same ability modifier used for the attack roll to the damage. A spell tells you exactly what to roll for damage.

Any time an effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all targets.

##### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you double the attack�s damage against the target (including any static modifiers to the damage roll). A critical hit can be turned into a regular hit by sacrificing an equipped shield (see Equipment) or choosing to suffer fatigue (see Fatigue below).

##### Damage Types

Most damaging attacks or effects deal one or more of the following types of damage: **acid**, **bludgeoning**, **cold**, **fire**, **force**,

**lightning**, **necrotic**, **piercing**, **poison**, **psychic**, **radiant**, **slashing**, **thunder**.

Other rules (such as damage resistance) rely on damage types.

##### Ongoing Damage

Some attacks, spells, and effects deal ongoing damage. This hit point loss happens at the end of each of your turns. Unless the effect states a damage type, the hit point loss is unaffected by damage resistance or vulnerability (see below).

An effect that deals ongoing damage specifies the circumstance that ends the damage.

## Damage Resistance, Vulnerability, and Immunity

A creature or an object with **resistance** to a damage type takes only half the damage whenever it takes damage from that type.

A creature or an object with **vulnerability** to a damage type takes twice the damage whenever it takes damage from that type.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage.

Two instances of resistance or vulnerability affecting the same damage don�t stack.

Some creatures and objects are **immune** to certain types of damage or damage inflicted by mundane weapons. Damage immunity doesn�t modify damage dealt; instead the immune creature is unaffected by damage of that type. Furthermore, some creatures are immune to certain conditions.

## Fatigue, Death, and Doom

##### Massive Damage and Instant Death

Massive damage can injure or kill you instantly. If you are reduced to 0 hit points after taking an amount of damage equal to or greater than 20 + triple your character level (or Hit Dice for creatures), you make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you die instantly. On a success, you live but suffer one level of fatigue and one level of strife.

##### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

Damage that reduces you to 0 hit points without killing you knocks you unconscious (see Conditions). Regaining any hit points ends this unconsciousness.

Falling unconscious as a result of taking damage during an encounter is traumatic and inflicts a level of fatigue (see below).

##### Dying and Death Saving Throws

When you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you are dying. While dying, when you begin your turn you must make a death saving throw, a special saving throw that isn�t tied to an ability score. Like other saving throws, it can be affected by circumstances that modify your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. On a result of 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. Keep track of your successes and failures over multiple turns until you collect three successes or three failures. On your third success, you become stable. On your third failure, you

die. When you regain hit points or become stable, your successes and failures counts are reset.

**Rolling a 1 or 20.** When you make a death saving throw and roll a natural 1, you suffer one level of fatigue and one level of strife. If you roll a natural 20, you regain 1 hit point, immediately regain consciousness, and are able to take the rest of your turn.

**Being Attacked at 0 Hit Points.** If you take damage from an attack while you�re on 0 hit points, the attacker can choose to make you suffer a death saving throw failure, one level of fatigue, or one level of strife.

**Other Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take any other damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. At the Narrator�s discretion, depending on the nature of the damage, such as blasting steam or errant magic, this might instead inflict a level of fatigue or strife.

##### Stabilizing a Creature

Even when you can�t restore hit points to a creature, you can stabilize so it doesn�t need to make death saving throws.

As an action, you can administer first aid to an unconscious creature by making a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. On a success, the creature stabilizes.

When stable, a creature is no longer dying and doesn�t make death saving throws. It remains unconscious while at 0 hit points. If a stable creature takes any damage, it is dying again and must begin making death saving throws again. After being stable for 1d4 hours, a creature regains 1 hit point.

##### Fatigue

Sometimes during an encounter, a creature will gain an injury representing a serious wound. This is represented by fatigue.

**Suffering Fatigue.** You gain a level of fatigue:

* Each time you take damage that makes you fall unconscious during an encounter.
* When you take a critical hit while at 0 hit points.
* When you take a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block it, turning the critical hit into a regular hit and suffering a level of fatigue (if you have a shield, you can Sacrifice Shield instead; see Equipment). Once you�ve turned a critical hit into a regular hit in this way, you can�t do so again until you finish a rest.

The effects of fatigue gained during combat are only felt after the encounter in which they were inflicted has ended. During the heat of battle it is easy to fight on without realizing the extent of your injuries.

A creature can survive multiple such injuries and continue adventuring; however, injuries are not to be ignored lightly. If you gain seven levels of fatigue, you are doomed (see below), as your combined injuries mean you�re beyond the aid of all but the most powerful healing magics.

##### Doomed

A doomed creature has sustained damage to their body, mind, and spirit that puts it beyond the help of normal recovery and lesser magic. While the symptoms of a doomed creature�s injuries might be

removed, only powerful spells such as *regeneration* or *resurrection* can spare it from death or restore it to life.

Suffering the effects of seven or more levels of fatigue is one way to become doomed; however at the Narrator's discretion a creature might become doomed for any number of other reasons.

The doomed condition is described in Conditions.

##### Monsters, NPCs, and Death

Rather than falling unconscious, accruing injuries, or making death saving throws, a monster that drops to 0 hit points usually dies immediately.

Essential villains and important nonplayer characters are common exceptions. The Narrator might rule that a nonplayer character follows the same dying rules as player characters, or they might become doomed the moment they hit 0 hit points�allowing them a final dramatic action or speech before they succumb and die.

## Knocking a Creature Out

When a melee attack drops a creature to 0 hit points, the attacker can knock the creature unconscious. This choice is made when the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature falls unconscious, gains a level of fatigue, and is stable.

## Healing and Recovery

Rest and magic can heal a creature, restoring its hit points. Restored hit points regained are added to a creature�s current

hit points, up to their hit point maximum. Excess healing has no effect.

A dead creature can�t regain hit points unless it is restored to life first.

##### Recovering From Fatigue

Recovering from fatigue is more difficult than restoring hit points.

A creature can recover from the initial level of fatigue during a long rest anywhere, but recovering from two or more levels of fatigue requires long rests taken at a Haven (see Exploration). While resting a Haven, a creature reduces its level of fatigue by one each time it finishes a long rest.

## Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and special abilities grant a creature temporary hit points, a separately tracked buffer against damage.

When a creature takes damage, any temporary hit points are lost first, and remaining damage is subtracted from normal hit points.

Healing can�t restore temporary hit points because they are separate from actual hit points. However, temporary hit points plus current hit points can exceed a creature�s hit point maximum. A creature can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Temporary hit points can�t be added together�if you receive temporary hit points while you already have some, you decide whether to keep the new set or the old set.

Temporary hit points don�t end the dying, stabilized, or unconscious conditions.

However, you can receive temporary hit points even while you�re at 0 hit points, and the temporary hit points still absorb damage.

Unless otherwise stated, temporary hit points disappear when they�re expended or when you finish a long rest.

## World Bonuses, Penalties, and Cover

##### Difficult Terrain

One of the most common forms of world penalties is difficult terrain. Anything from dense bramble, precarious steps, or tenacious mud can reduce your normal movement Speed.

Every foot of movement you take within difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. Multiple hazards that would cause difficult terrain in a space don�t stack. However, additional conditions that increase the cost of movement (such as crawling while prone) stack with difficult terrain.

##### Cover

Obstacles such as trees and stone walls can help to keep creatures out of sight and out of harm�s way.

Cover offers you protection against attacks and effects from the other side of it. There are three types of cover: half cover,

three-quarters cover, and total cover. If you are behind multiple sources of cover, you only gain the benefits from the most protective source of cover.

**Half cover** is provided by obstacles that block at least half of your body. Half cover grants you a +2 bonus to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide.

**Three-quarters cover** obscures

three-quarters of your body.. It grants you a

+5 bonus to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide.

**Total cover** keeps you completely concealed from the other side. While you�re behind total cover, creatures can�t target you directly with attacks, spells, or ability checks, although spells that target an area or ability checks made to search the area might still affect you.

##### World Actions

Environments are often dynamic spaces with moving parts other than their inhabitants. Within Turn-Based Action, the world gets its own turn to enact these moving parts in the form of a world action.

After the environment uses a world action with a recharge, the Narrator rolls 1d6. On a result equal to or greater than the listed number, the environment regains its world action. Otherwise, at the start of each round the Narrator repeats the roll until the environment regains the world action.

##### Example Environments

If a particular bonus, penalty, or action doesn�t make sense for where the participants are located, the Narrator can reskin a different environment�s effects or forgo using them altogether for a

Turn-Based Action encounter. That said, an unexpected effect can prompt creativity, challenge, and intrigue in the game.

CAVERNOUS

**Echo.** Sound travels twice as far, and any effect that causes thunder damage deals 1 extra point of damage per die rolled.

**Loose Foundation.** Area hazard that can cause the entire section of cave to collapse within 2 rounds of being disturbed by any explosive effect or significant impact. Creatures still in the area when the collapse occurs are

grappled (escape DC 12) and start to suffocate.

**Stalactites.** Obstacles that can be knocked down by ranged attacks that deal any damage (AC 12). A creature beneath a falling stalactite makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or takes 2d6 piercing damage.

**Stalagmites.** Obstacles that provide half cover.

FIERY

**Burning Surface.** A creature that touches an unattended object or a surface for the first time on a turn takes 1d6 fire damage.

**Floating Ash.** A participant that ends their turn in the area makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or is blinded until the start of its next turn.

WORLD ACTIONS

**Flame Burst (Recharge 4�6).** One creature makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or takes 1d12 fire damage.

**Sweltering Heat.** Each creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffers one level of fatigue.

FORESTED

**Brush.** Obstacles that provide half cover to a prone creature within 5 feet.

**Trees (Fallen or Standing).** Obstacles that provide half cover.

**Fallen Leaves.** Might conceal potholes, traps, and other hazards. A creature can perceive what�s under the leaves by making a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

WORLD ACTIONS

**Distressed Animal Cacophony (Recharge 4�6).** Creatures can only

hear sounds within 10 feet of them (except for loud, explosive noises) until the start of the environment�s next turn.

FRIGID

**Frostbitten Surface.** A creature that touches an unattended object or a surface for the first time on a turn takes 1d6 cold damage, unless that creature has cold resistance or its skin isn�t exposed to the surface.

**Icy Patch.** Once a creature starts moving through this area in a particular direction, movement in another direction is considered difficult terrain to it until the start of its next turn.

**Snow.** The area is lightly obscured.

WORLD ACTIONS

**Cold Chill (Recharge 4�6).** Each creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or takes 2d6 cold damage. This damage is reduced to 1d6 if the creature is wearing cold-weather gear.

FURNISHED

**Chandelier.** Obstacle that can be swung from with a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A creature beneath a falling chandelier makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Clutter.** Counts as difficult terrain. A creature that uses the Dash action to move through the area makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or falls prone.

**Mirror.** When targeted by a cantrip or 1st-level spell, a creature using this Medium-sized object as cover can use their reaction to reflect the spell back

onto the spellcaster by succeeding on a Dexterity check contested by the creature�s spellcasting ability check. On a

failure, the spell hits a randomly determined unoccupied square instead. The mirror then breaks.

**Tables.** Obstacles that can be pushed over as an action to provide half cover.

HAZY

**Blanketed Ground.** Might conceal potholes, traps, and other hazards. A creature can perceive what�s under the fog by making a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Thick Fog.** The area is heavily obscured.

WORLD ACTIONS

**Shadow Puppet (Recharge 6).** A **shadow** that looks identical to a random creature in the haze manifests, acting on initiative count 20. The shadow can see through the fog clearly and is hostile to everyone.

**Twisting Haze.** Each creature in the haze teleports to a random, unoccupied space within 5 feet.

ROCKY

**Boulder.** A creature can use an action to dislodge and roll the boulder by making a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature in the boulder�s path makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or takes 2d10 damage.

**Loose Rocks.** Object that can be used for a thrown weapon attack (range 15/30 ft., 1d4 bludgeoning damage).

**Uneven Footing.** The area is difficult terrain.

WORLD ACTIONS

**Falling Rocks (Recharge 5�6).** Each creature near a treacherous cliffside makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

STORMY

**Heavy Precipitation.** The area is difficult terrain.

**Loud Winds.** Creatures can only hear sounds within 15 feet of them (except for loud, explosive noises).

WORLD ACTIONS

**Forceful Gale.** One creature makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw or is pushed 15 feet. This movement doesn�t provoke opportunity attacks.

**Lightning Strike (Recharge 5�6).** One creature makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or takes 4d6 lightning damage.

This action can�t target that creature again until Turn-Based Action ends.

SWAMPY

**Thick Trudge.** The area is difficult terrain.

**Tenacious Mud.** A creature that ends its turn in the area makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw or is restrained until the end of its next turn. The creature can also use their action to break free.

WORLD ACTIONS

**Swamp Gas.** Each creature in the area makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or is poisoned until the end of its next turn.

**Leeches (Recharge 6).** A **swarm of insects** (leeches) rises out of the swamp to attack any creature in the area.

## Controlling Summons and Multiple Creatures

The Narrator typically controls all characters that aren�t the PCs. However, players might command mounts and hirelings, summon familiars, or conjure squads of

reinforcements during a Turn-Based Action encounter to tip the scales in their favor.

Creatures under your control can take their movement at any point on your turn.

Identical creatures move as a group, provided each creature is within 5 feet of at least one other member.

You can use your bonus action to command a single creature or group of creatures to take their actions. For groups, this means each member performs the same action against the same target or towards the same goal.

**For group ability checks:**

1. Roll the ability check for one member of the group.
2. For Strength-based group ability checks, add +1 for every other member of the group.

**For group attack rolls:**

1. The attack roll becomes a Dexterity saving throw made by the target. If the action already requires a saving throw, skip step 2.
2. The DC of the Dexterity saving throw equals 8 + the highest attack bonus of any creature in the group. On a failure, the target takes the attack's damage and any additional effects, or half damage and no additional effects on a success.
3. Add +1 to the DC and damage for each additional member of the group.

## Alternative Turn-Based Action Scenarios

The Turn-Based Action rules can be used for more than combat; they are ideal for

most high-octane situations. There are several alternative scenarios where an additional layer of granularity can provide new challenges and strategies for the participants.

##### Suspended Movement

Adventures can take you under the sea, into the sky, or adrift in the Astral Plane. These scenarios aren�t anchored to the ground and expand your movement options to a whole new dimension.

Participants in these Turn-Based Action encounters can move in any direction and have their movement suspended vertically from any ground. The conditions of this suspension depend on the environment.

**While participants are suspended in a large body of water:**

* Bludgeoning and fire damage are halved.
* Ranged weapon attacks beyond the weapon�s normal range automatically miss their target.
* Unless the weapon is thrown, attacks made with ranged weapons have disadvantage.
* Dexterity-based ability checks and melee weapon attacks have disadvantage unless the attacker has a swim speed.

**While participants are aloft in the sky:**

* When a creature is knocked prone, restrained, or otherwise has no fly speed, it automatically begins to fall.
* Willing movement made vertically downward costs half the distance (in feet) that it normally would. A creature that

moves 10 feet downward only spends 5 feet of its movement to do so.

**While participants are adrift in an intangible, space-like environment such as the Astral Plane:**

* Creatures and objects have vulnerability to psychic damage, unless they are proficient in either Intelligence or Wisdom saving throws.
* A creature�s Speed is determined by its thoughts. Each creature gains a fly speed equal to 30 feet + (5 feet � its Intelligence modifier).

##### Rolling Movement

When each participant of the Turn-Based Action encounter is moving in roughly the same direction, such as in a chase:

* The Narrator determines the direction and the base speed of the encounter per round, typically either 30 feet or the base Speed of the

second-slowest active participant.

* The World Actions phase of Turn-Based Action occurs at the start of each participant�s turn, affecting only them.
* Participants can�t use their basic movement to move further forward without Dashing or performing an improvised action. They can still move sideways or slow down.
* Participants that become too distant from the action must find

a way to return themselves, wait for active participants to move the action back to them, or wait until the end of the encounter.

##### Countdowns

**TABLE: APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF ROLLS**

A countdown takes place when there is an unknown time limit before something occurs.

The countdown is started by forming a pool of six-sided dice. The Narrator determines the size of that dice pool based on the circumstances.

At the start of each round, the dice pool is rolled. Any dice with a result of 6 are removed from the dice pool, and play continues. The countdown is not immutable: the Narrator might deem that certain actions during the scenario adds or removes a die from the countdown, and there will often be a way to stop the countdown entirely.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DICE POOL** | **SLOW (6)** | **MEDIUM (5�6)** | **FAST (4�6)** |
| 1d6 | 6 | 3 | 2 |
| 2d6 | 9 | 4 | 3 |
| 3d6 | 11 | 5 | 3 |
| 4d6 | 12 | 6 | 4 |
| 5d6 | 13 | 6 | 4 |
| 6d6 | 14 | 7 | 4 |
| 7d6 | 15 | 7 | 4 |
| 8d6 | 15 | 7 | 4 |
| 9d6 | 16 | 7 | 5 |
| 10d6 | 17 | 8 | 5 |

However, sometimes a countdown can�t be stopped�the cliff *is* going to crumble, and you must reach the top before it does!

When the last die is removed from the dice pool, the countdown expires.

For a faster countdown, remove any dice that roll a 5 or a 6, or that roll a 4, 5, or 6. See Table: Approximate Number of Rolls for a guide to how long each countdown can be expected to last. However, remember that these are only average figures, and even the slowest countdown can end quickly if the dice fall badly.

# Combat Maneuvers

## Combat Traditions

Combat traditions are the basic disciplines of fighting that a warrior relies upon: Adamant Mountain, Biting Zephyr, Mirror�s Glint, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current, Razor�s Edge, Sanguine Knot, Spirited Steed, Tempered Iron, Tooth and Claw, and Unending Wheel.

## Maneuvers in Combat

Adventurers can do much more than just hit an opponent or dodge a blow, instead delivering special attacks that debilitate or turn a foe�s missed assault into a painful mistake. Many of these techniques are combat maneuvers, sublime methods and tactics that make every combatant and their approach to fighting unique.

You know a number of combat maneuvers determined by your class and class level.

Your known combat maneuvers are chosen from the combat traditions you are proficient with. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower.

Using a combat maneuver requires spending one or more exertion points and either a bonus action, reaction, or action. Certain combat maneuvers require two or more attacks (from Extra Attacks or the use of other class features), and if you are unable to use the Attack action to make as many attacks on your turn as the combat

maneuver requires, you cannot use that combat maneuver.

A maneuver sometimes forces a target to make a saving throw to resist its effects.

The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier

Combat maneuvers are nonmagical.

##### Prerequisites

In order to learn a combat maneuver, you must know its combat tradition and meet any prerequisites. New combat maneuvers learned through a feat or by taking levels in an additional class may be up to the highest degree of combat maneuvers you are able to learn.

##### Stances

Activating a combat stance requires a bonus action. Once activated, a combat stance remains active until you are knocked unconscious, stunned, activate a different combat stance, begin a long rest, or choose to end it on your turn.

## Exertion Pool

To use a combat maneuver, you must expend exertion points. You have a maximum number of exertion points equal to double your proficiency bonus. You regain any spent exertion points at the end of a short or long rest.

Alternatively, you can meditate, refocus, and stretch to refill your exertion pool more quickly. You expend Hit Dice to do so, recovering 1d4 exertion points for each Hit Die expended. The process takes 1 minute per expended Hit Die.

## Basic Maneuvers

Several basic maneuvers are presented below. The Narrator can use these to help adjudicate other improvised actions, following a similar structure and using similarly weighted effects.

All creatures can use basic maneuvers, even if they do not have access to combat maneuvers. No exertion points are required to use a basic maneuver. Unless otherwise noted, using a basic maneuver replaces an attack made on your turn.

**Basic Melee Damage**. When you successfully use a basic maneuver you also deal basic melee damage. This is equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. Basic melee damage is bludgeoning damage, but at the Narrator�s discretion may be piercing or slashing damage.

You cannot use a basic maneuver to activate any features that deal additional damage (such as Sneak Attack or Divine Smite) unless the feature specifically states otherwise.

Any creature with a Challenge Rating of 0 cannot deal basic melee damage.

##### Disarm

You can use the Disarm maneuver to attempt to knock an item or weapon from a creature�s hand. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.

The target must be within your reach and be holding an item (either carried or wielded). The target makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and the target drops the item in its space. The target has advantage if it is larger than you or holding the item

with two or more hands, and a target smaller than you has disadvantage.

##### Grab On

While you cannot grapple a creature two or more size categories larger than you, you can grab onto it. By jumping onto its back or climbing up a limb, you can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against the creature�s maneuver DC to cling to or balance upon its body. On a success, you move into the creature�s space and can move upon its body as if it is difficult terrain.

While grabbing onto a larger creature, you gain advantage on attack rolls against it.

The larger creature may be able to attack you as normal, depending on its limbs or attacks. It can also use an action or replace one of its attacks on its turn to try to dislodge you, for instance shaking you loose or bashing you against a wall, forcing you to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against its maneuver DC or fall prone into the nearest space adjacent to the creature, taking its basic melee damage in the process.

If the creature chooses to roll over in order to dislodge you, it becomes prone, but you have disadvantage on the saving throw to hang on.

##### Grapple

You can use the Grapple maneuver to grab or wrestle a creature. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.

You must have at least one free hand to attempt a grapple, your target must be within your reach, and the target must be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic

melee damage and the target becomes grappled (see Conditions). In addition to other circumstances that end the condition, you can release the target at any time (no action required).

***Escaping a Grapple***. While grappled, a creature can use its action to attempt to escape. It must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC.

***Moving a Grappled Creature***. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you. When you do so, your Speed is halved, unless the creature�s weight is within your carrying capacity and you are not encumbered by bulky items.

***Freeing a Grappled Creature.*** You can use the Grapple maneuver to try to free another grappled or restrained creature. The creature grappling or restraining the target makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. If it fails the saving throw, the grappled or restrained creature is freed. Additionally, you may move the freed creature 5 feet in any direction.

##### Knockdown

You can use the Knockdown maneuver to trip or push a creature down. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.

The target must be within your reach and be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and knock the target prone.

##### Overrun

You can use an action or bonus action to make an Overrun maneuver to move

through a hostile creature�s space by forcing your way past. Make a Strength saving throw against the target�s maneuver DC. On a success, you deal basic melee damage and can move through the hostile creature�s space once this turn. The creature can choose to just let you pass instead of rolling. You have advantage if you are larger than the target, or disadvantage if you are smaller. If you are two or more sizes smaller than the target, you can move through the hostile creature�s space without making a save. You still provoke opportunity attacks if you move beyond a creature�s reach.

##### Shove

You can use the Shove maneuver to push a creature away. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.

The target must be within your reach and be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and push the target a number of feet away from you up to 5 + 5 for every 5 points it failed its saving throw by. You can move the creature in any direction away from you (to the side, forward, or diagonally away).

A creature that is shoved off of a precipice is propelled off of whatever it is standing on�it does not receive any saving throw or ability check to grab onto something to avoid falling down below.

# Spellcasting

## Knowing and Preparing Spells

Before it may be cast, a spell must be known (learned and conceptually understood) and prepared (memorized in detail in a ready-to-cast form). Each spellcasting class has a different approach to learning and preparing spells.

Some character classes, such as clerics, druids, and heralds, know most spells which are available to their class, and choose a subset of those spells to prepare at any given time.

Other classes, such as bards and sorcerers, choose a small set of spells which they know, each of which is always prepared. They can only know a fixed number of spells at any level.

Wizards maintain a large and ever-growing collection of known spells, of which they have a certain number prepared at any time. Wizards can learn any number of new spells without giving up old ones; the only limit is the scarcity of magical scrolls and spellbooks to copy.

##### Rare Spells

Many spellcasters leave their mark on the world by individualizing their spells. Some of these unique spells have been lost to antiquity, but a few are preserved in ancient scrolls.

Some spell descriptions include one or more rare versions of the spell. A rare spell is a little-known variant of an existing spell which offers a change or improvement to the spell�s functionality. It�s usually named after its creator. The Narrator determines

which, if any, rare spells are available to discover or research.

A rare spell can�t be chosen when selecting new spells at character creation or when gaining a level�it is obtained on a specially-scribed scroll or learned through costly research. When a character acquires a scroll bearing a rare version of a spell, they may spend a long rest to learn it if it is on their spell list. Doing so destroys the scroll. Alternatively, with the Narrator�s assistance, a player can use the Research downtime activity to invent or reinvent rare spells. For classes which only know a limited number of spells, a rare spell does not count against their number of spells known. For classes which prepare a limited number of spells, this spell must be prepared separately.

## Casting Spells

As spellcasters advance in character level, they gain the ability to prepare and cast more powerful spells.

A spell�s level determines the amount of mental energy the spellcaster must expend to cast the spell. Spells are ranked in complexity and power from level 0 to 9.

0th-level spells, also called cantrips, can be cast effortlessly. Other spells require an investment of energy, and can only be cast a limited number of times between rests.

The most complex and powerful spells, 9th-level spells, can only be employed by the mightiest spellcasters, and generally only once per long rest.

##### Spell Slots

Most spellcasting classes� reserves of magical energy are represented by a number of spell slots, each of which has a spell level. More and higher-level spell slots

become available as a character gains experience in a spellcasting class. A spell slot is expended when a character casts a spell at that spell level. When all the slots of a given spell level have been used, the character can no longer cast spells at that spell level. Taking a long rest restores all spell slots.

##### Casting Spells With a Higher Slot

A spell can be cast as a higher-level spell if there is a higher-level spell slot available to spend.

Some spells have more powerful effects when cast using a higher-level spell slot. For instance, *cure wounds* restore more hit points when cast as a 2nd-level spell. Such benefits apply to both the normal version of a spell and any rare variant.

When casting a spell using a higher-level spell slot that the spell provides no benefits for, you gain the benefits for casting at the highest-level spell slot that qualifies.

##### Casting Spells Without Slots

Some magic items allow characters to cast certain spells without expending spell slots.

A magical spell scroll allows a character to cast a single spell, if the spell is on the character�s spell list. After the spell is cast, the scroll loses its magic. A character who uses a magical scroll can cast it at a higher level, or even cast a spell of a higher level than the character can normally cast, by making an ability check, using their spellcasting ability against a DC of 10 + the level at which they cast the spell. On a failure, the scroll loses its magic. A character may increase the spell�s casting time by 12 hours in a magical stronghold appropriate to their class, such as a wizard's tower or a cleric's temple. If they do so, they gain a bonus to their spellcasting ability check equal to the grade of the stronghold.

Character abilities granted by class or heritage may also grant the innate ability to cast spells without using spell slots.

##### Cantrips

0th-level spells (cantrips) don�t require spell slots to cast, and can be cast any number of times per day. Cantrips don�t need to be prepared. A spellcasting class� description indicates how many cantrips a character knows at any given level.

##### Rituals

Certain spells can be cast as a ritual. Such spells have a special tag, Ritual, listed on the same line as the spell�s casting time.

If a character has a Ritual Spellcasting feature, they can choose to cast such a spell either normally or as a ritual. If they choose to cast it as a ritual, they do so without expending a spell slot. Casting the spell in this way takes an extra 10 minutes to cast. A spell cast as a ritual can�t be cast as a higher-level spell.

Most characters must have a spell prepared in order to cast it as a ritual, though wizards can cast any known spell as a ritual.

##### Casting Spells in Armor

A spellcaster can�t cast spells while wearing armor in which they�re not proficient.

## Spell Descriptions

Each spell begins with a block of rules information specifying the spell�s name, spell school, tags, casting time, range,

components, and duration. Some spells may also include an entry for target, area, and saving throw. A description of the spell follows the spell block.

## Classical Spell Schools

Every spell belongs to one or more schools of magic. These schools include 8 classical schools of magic, as defined by mages long past and handed down in formal tradition.

Each classical school represents a different type of magical energy being channeled, and a spell can only belong to one classical school. A magical effect�s school is usually detectable by effects such as *detect magic*.

**Abjuration** spells involve the forces of protection and warding. *Shield* is an abjuration spell.

**Conjuration** spells cause objects to be teleported or summoned. *Find familiar* is a Conjuration spell.

**Divination** spells provide information and uncover secrets. *Detect magic* is a Divination spell.

**Enchantment** spells twist the mind.

*Charm person* is an Enchantment spell.

**Evocation** spells call forth magical energy. *Cure wounds* and *magic missile* are evocation spells.

**Illusion** spells create false sensory impressions. *Silent image* is an illusion spell.

**Necromancy** spells deal with the power of death. *Inflict wounds* is a necromancy spell.

**Transmutation** spells transform or change their subjects, or grant a creature new abilities. *Jump* is a transmutation spell.

##### Other Spell Schools

The formal, classical spell schools are not the only way magic-users throughout the ages have labeled spells. In the multiverse there is a near-infinite array of spell schools; some are based on elemental sources (like beasts, fire, plants, shadow, water, and so on), while others are based on effects (compulsion, healing, and more). While a spell can belong to only one classical spell school, it can belong to any number of other spell schools. These spell schools have no rules of their own, but may be referred to by other game rules. For instance, a monster�s description might state that it can cast any spell in the fire school.

This book contains spells using the following schools: acid, affliction, air, arcane, attack, beasts, chaos, cold, communication, compulsion, divine, earth, enhancement, evil, fear, fire, force, good, healing, knowledge, law, lightning, movement, nature, necrotic, negation, obscurement, planar, plants, poison, prismatic, protection, psychic, radiant, scrying, senses, shadow, shapechanging, sound, storm, summoning, technological, telepathy, teleportation, terrain, thunder, time, transformation, unarmed, undead, utility, water, weaponry, weather.

##### Casting Time

Most spells take one action to cast.

Some spells are cast with a bonus action. A spellcaster can�t cast a spell as a bonus action on the same turn that they cast another spell, unless the second spell is a cantrip with a casting time of one action.

Other spells use a reaction. This type of spell will describe the trigger that allows the spell to be cast.

A few spells (and spells cast as rituals) have a longer casting time. A spellcaster

must use their action every turn to maintain such a spell. Furthermore, they must concentrate on the spell (see below).

Otherwise, the spell fails, and the spellcaster doesn�t expend a spell slot or any material components the spell requires.

Rapid Summoning

Conjuration spells that summon powerful or extraplanar creatures take longer to enact, but by choosing to forge a more tenuous connection it�s possible to cast these more quickly than normal.

When casting *conjure celestial, conjure elemental, conjure fey, conjure minor elementals*, or any other spell that conjures creatures and has a casting time of 1 minute, a spellcaster can choose to reduce the spell�s casting time to 1d4+1 actions and the spell�s duration to 1 minute. The spellcaster must maintain concentration on the casting each round, using an action on each of their turns until the casting is complete. At any time on their turn after the casting begins, the spellcaster may choose to abandon the rapid summoning to cast a different spell that has a casting time of 1 action and uses a spell slot of the same level or less.

##### Range

A spell�s range is the maximum distance to its target or targets at the moment that the spell is cast. For some spells, the target is a creature or object. For other spells, the target is a point in space.

Some spells have a range of Self, meaning that they only affect the spellcaster, or (for a spell that affects an area) that the point of origin of the spell is the spellcaster. Other spells have a range of Touch, meaning that they affect either the spellcaster or a target that they touch.

Still other spells can only affect targets within a certain number of feet. Common distances include short range (30 feet or less), medium range (60 feet or less), or long range (120 feet or less). Some spells have much longer ranges, such as a mile or more, or are not limited by distance.

##### Target

Some, but not all, spells have a target listed in the spell block. This type of spell operates on the specified type of creatures or objects within range. Unless the spell indicates otherwise, the spellcaster is a valid target of a spell which acts on a creature or creatures.

Unless otherwise specified by the spell, there must be a clear path (no total cover) between the spellcaster and part of the target. If the target is an unwilling creature, the spellcaster must also be able to see it or otherwise know its precise location.

##### Area

Some, but not all, spells have an area listed in the stat block. Anything within this area can be affected by the spell.

Every area has a point of origin from which its effects radiate. The point of origin is determined by the spell�s range. If the spell�s range is Self, the point of origin is the spellcaster. If the point of origin is given as a distance, the point of origin can be anywhere within that distance. If there is no clear path between the spellcaster and the intended point of origin of the spell, the spell�s point of origin is on the near side of the obstruction blocking the path.

For most spells, if there is no clear path between the point of origin and a location within the spell�s area, that location is not affected by the spell. Some spells specify that their effect travels around corners. In

that case, a location is affected if a

non-straight line from the location connects to the point of origin without leaving the spell�s area.

Spell areas usually take one of five shapes: a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.

A **cone** extends from its point of origin in a direction of the spellcaster�s choice, and need not include the origin. A cone�s maximum width is equal to its length.

A **cube**�s point of origin can be anywhere on any face of the cube, and need not include the origin. A cube�s length is also its width and height.

A **cylinder**�s point of origin is the center of the circle at the top or bottom of the cylinder. The bottom of the cylinder rests on the ground. A cylinder includes its point of origin.

A **line** extends straight from its point of origin, and need not include its point of origin.

A **sphere**�s point of origin is its center, and is included in its area. The sphere�s radius is the distance from its point of origin to any edge.

##### Created Effects

Some spells have no target or area, but create or summon an object, creature, or effect within the spell�s range. Unless otherwise specified in the spell description, the spellcaster does not need to see the space where the object, creature, or effect will appear but there must be a clear path to the space; if there is no clear path, the spell will affect the space on the near side of the obstruction blocking the path.

##### Components

The process of casting a spell requires the use of specific actions or objects, called

components. These components may allow observers to recognize that a spell is being cast. A spell may include any of the following types of components:

**Vocalized (V):** A spell with a vocalized component is apparent to creatures that can hear. A character under the effect of a *silence* spell or otherwise unable to make noise can�t cast a spell with a vocalized component.

**Seen (S):** A spell with a seen component is apparent to creatures that can see. A spell cast with a seen component can�t be cast by an incapacitated creature or a creature that has its hands full with weapons (or a shield) that are not being used as a spell focus.

**Material (M):** A spell with a material component lists a specific physical object which the spellcaster must provide. If no cost is specified for the object and it does not require part of the target, a character may substitute a component pouch or spellcasting focus (see Equipment).

Some spells note that their material component is consumed as part of the casting. A spell cast with a material component requires that the caster hold the material component during the casting of the spell.

Even if a creature witnesses a spell being cast, the effect or even the target of the spell may not be obvious.

##### Duration, Combination, and Concentration

A spell�s duration is how long it lasts. Many spells have an Instantaneous duration, meaning that their magic ends as the spell is cast, leaving the world changed in a way that can�t be undone with *dispel magic* or a similar effect.

Other spells have durations of one round or longer. A creature, object, or area might be under the effect of two or more such spells at the same time. In most cases, the effects of both spells combine. However, multiple castings of the same spell don�t combine. When two versions of the same spells overlap, the most powerful effect applies.

Some spells have a duration which includes concentration. Such a spell requires some level of focus and attention, although the spellcaster can perform most activities while concentrating on a spell. If this concentration ends, the spell ends prematurely.

A spellcaster�s concentration can be ended by any of the following:

* The spellcaster chooses to end concentration at any time.
* The spellcaster is incapacitated or killed.
* The spellcaster successfully casts another spell that requires concentration.
* The Narrator may rule that a sudden interruption, such as a push, may force the spellcaster to make a DC 10 Constitution check. On a failure, the spell ends.
* If the spellcaster takes damage while concentrating on a spell, they must make a Constitution saving throw; on a failure, the spell ends. The DC is 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher.

##### Saving Throw

If a spell allows an affected creature to make a saving throw, the saving throw

ability score will be specified in the spell block. A creature may voluntarily fail a saving throw. Unless noted otherwise, objects always fail saving throws.

Some spells deal half damage to a creature that succeeds on its saving throw. These spells have the word �halves� listed after the ability score used. For instance, �Dexterity halves� means an affected creature takes half damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.

Other spells that aren�t as direct about their effects on a creature are marked as �special�. For instance, the flesh to stone spell is marked as �Constitution (special)� because it requires more than one saving throw that has staged effects for failed saves.

The DC to resist a spell is 8 + the spellcaster�s spellcasting ability modifier + the spellcaster�s proficiency bonus.

##### Attack Roll

Some spells require a successful attack roll to affect their target. This is specified in the spell�s description. Ranged and melee spell attacks follow all the rules for ranged and melee attacks.

The attack bonus for a spell attack is the spellcaster�s spellcasting ability modifier + the spellcaster�s proficiency bonus.

You set an alarm that alerts you whenever a creature of size Tiny or larger touches the target or enters the target area. When you cast the spell, choose any number of creatures. These creatures don�t set off the alarm.

Choose whether the alarm is silent or audible. The silent alarm is heard in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the target, and it awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces a loud, 10-second duration noise of your choosing that can be heard up to 60 feet away.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** You may create an additional alarm for each slot level above 1st. The spell�s range increases to 600 feet, but you must be familiar with the locations you ward, and all alarms must be set within the same physical structure. Setting off one alarm does not activate the other alarms.

*Altered State:* You decide what you look like. None of your gameplay statistics change but you can alter anything about your body�s appearance, including but not limited to: your heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, sound of your voice, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex, and any other distinguishing features. You cannot become a creature of a different size category, and your limb structure remains the same. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to change your appearance.

*Red in Tooth and Claw:* You grow magical natural weapons of your choice with a +1 bonus to attack and damage. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage of a type determined by the natural weapon you chose.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a spell slot of 5th-level, add the following to the list of forms you can adopt.

*Greater Natural Weapons.* The damage dealt by your natural weapon increases to 2d6, and you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with your natural weapons.

*Mask of the Grave.* You adopt the appearance of a skeleton or zombie (your choice). Your type changes to undead, and mindless undead creatures

ignore your presence, treating you as one of their own. You don�t need to breathe and you become immune to poison.

*Wings.* A pair of wings sprouts from your back. The wings can appear

bird-like, leathery like a bat or dragon�s wings, or like the wings of an insect. You gain a fly speed equal to your base Speed.

## Angel Paradox

*7th-level (evocation; radiant, undead)*

**Classes:** Cleric, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** One non-celestial creature

**Components:** V

**Duration**: 7 days

The target is bombarded with a fraction of energy stolen from some slumbering, deific source, immediately taking 40 radiant damage. This spell ignores resistances but does not ignore immunities. A creature killed by this spell does not decay and cannot become undead for the spell�s duration. Days spent under the influence of this spell don�t count against the time limit of spells such as *raise dead*. This effect ends early if the corpse takes necrotic damage.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage and duration increase to 45 radiant damage and 1 year when using an 8th-level spell slot, or 50 damage and until dispelled when using a 9th-level spell slot.

## Animal Friendship

*1st-level (enchantment; beasts, compulsion, nature)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** Beast that you can see that is able to hear you and has Intelligence 3 or less

**Components:** V, S, M (red ribbon)

**Duration:** 24 hours

**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates Until the spell ends or one of your

companions harms it, the target is charmed by you.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** Choose one additional target for each slot level above 1st.

**Rare: Lasting Animal Friendship.** So long as the target has a CR equal to or less than half your proficiency bonus, the spell�s duration becomes permanent until it is dispelled or you cast this spell again.

## Animal Messenger

*2nd-level (enchantment; beasts, communication, nature)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid

**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual) **Range:** Short (30 feet) **Target:** Tiny beast

**Components:** V, S, M (tightly rolled strip of paper)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You whisper a message of 25 words or less to the target, along with directions to a location you have visited and a brief description of the message�s recipient.

For the duration of the spell, the messenger travels towards the location at a rate of 50 miles per day for a messenger with a flying speed, or else 25 miles without.

When the messenger arrives, it speaks in your voice, delivering your message to the first creature matching the description you provided. If the messenger can�t find the recipient or reach its destination before the spell ends, the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.

## Animal Shapes

*8th-level (transmutation; beasts, shapechanging, transformation)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** Any number of willing creatures you can see

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (24 hours)

Each target transforms into a Large or smaller beast of your choice with a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. Each target may have the same or a different form than other targets.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform targets into new forms, gaining new hit points when they do so.

Until the spell ends or it is dropped to 0 hit points, the target�s game statistics (including its hit points) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast excepting its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can�t speak or cast spells. The target�s equipment melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target�s form has no effect until it leaves the form.

When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell�s effect on the target ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

**Rare: Amorphous Animal Shapes.** You may transform the targets into Large or smaller oozes of Challenge Rating 4 or lower.

## Animate Dead

*3rd-level (necromancy; necrotic, summoning, undead)*

**Classes:** Cleric, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** Touch

**Target:** Corpse or pile of bones of a Medium or Small creature

**Components:** V, S, M (two copper coins)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You animate a mortal�s remains to become your undead servant.

If the spell is cast upon bones you create a skeleton, and if cast upon a corpse you can choose to create a skeleton or a zombie.

The Narrator has the undead�s statistics.

While it is within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command any undead you created with this spell. When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the creature�s exact action and move, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area, which it follows until the task is complete or you issue it a new command. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself.

The undead is under your control for 24 hours unless you cast this spell on it before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours. Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 4 of your previously-animated undead instead of animating a new one. When no longer under your control, the undead no longer obeys your commands.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** You create or maintain control over 2 additional undead for each slot level above 3rd. When commanding more than 3 undead they make group attack rolls (see Combat).

**Rare: Chilling Animate Dead.** Natural weapon attacks by undead created using this spell deal cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

## Animate Objects

*5th-level (transmutation; arcane, transformation, weaponry)*

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Target:** Up to six unattended nonmagical objects

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) Choose up to 6 unattended nonmagical

Small or Tiny objects. You may also choose larger objects; treat Medium objects as 2 objects, Large objects as 3 objects, and Huge objects as 6 objects.

Until the spell ends or a target is reduced to 0 hit points, you animate the targets and turn them into constructs under your control.

Each construct has Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1, as well as a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover (if securely fastened to something larger, it has a Speed of 0), and blindsight to a range of 30 feet (blind beyond that distance). Otherwise a construct�s statistics are determined by its size.

If you animate 4 or more Small or Tiny objects, instead of controlling each construct individually they function as a construct swarm. Add together all swarm�s total hit points. Attacks against a construct swarm deal half damage. The construct

swarm reverts to individual constructs when it is reduced to 15 hit points or less.

You can use a bonus action to mentally command any construct made with this spell while within 500 feet of it. When you command multiple constructs using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the creature�s exact action and move, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area, which it follows until the task is complete or you issue it a new command. If not given a command, the construct only defends itself.

When you command a construct to attack, it makes a slam, a melee attack, against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit the construct deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage appropriate to its shape.

When the construct drops to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its inanimate object form.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** You can animate 2 additional Small or Tiny objects for each slot level above 5th.

**TABLE: ANIMATE OBJECTS**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SIZE** | **HP** | **AC** | **ATTACK** | **STR** | **DEX** |
| Tiny | 5 | 14 | +6 to hit,  1d4 � 3  damage | 4 | 18 |
| Small | 10 | 12 | +4 to hit,  1d6 � 2  damage | 6 | 14 |
| Swarm  of Tiny and  Small | varies | 13 | +5 to hit, 2d6 damage  (1d6 damage  if bloodied) | 5 | 16 |
| Mediu m | 20 | 11 | +3 to hit, 1d8 damage | 10 | 12 |

## Antilife Shell

*5h-level (abjuration; protection, technological, undead)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Area:** 10-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

A translucent barrier pops into existence around you. The barrier moves with you and prevents creatures other than undead and constructs from passing or reaching through its surface.

The barrier does not prevent spells or attacks with ranged or reach weapons from passing through the barrier.

The spell ends if you move so that a living creature is forced to pass through the barrier.

**Rare: Repelling Antilife Shell.** When the spell would force a living creature to pass through the barrier, that creature is harmlessly pushed back into a space of its choosing outside of the sphere and within 5 feet of its original position.

## Antimagic Field

*8th-level (abjuration; arcane, negation, planar, protection)*

**Classes:** Cleric, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Area:** 10-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, S, M (pinch of powdered cold iron)

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Large | 40 | 10 | +4 to hit,  2d8 + 2  damage | 14 | 10 |
| Huge | 80 | 8 | +6 to hit,  2d12 + 4  damage | 18 | 6 |

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

An invisible sphere of antimagic forms around you, moving with you and suppressing all magical effects within it. At the Narrator�s discretion, sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the sphere�s effects.

*Area Suppression:* When a magical effect protrudes into the sphere, that part of the effect�s area is suppressed.

*Creatures and Objects:* While within the sphere, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic temporarily ceases to exist while the space they occupy is within the sphere.

*Dispel Magic:* The sphere is immune to *dispel magic* and similar magical effects, including other *antimagic field* spells.

*Magic Items:* While within the sphere, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the sphere.

*Magical Travel:* Whether the sphere includes a destination or source, any planar travel or teleportation within it fails. Until the spell ends or the sphere moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a *bag of holding*) within the sphere are closed.

*Spells:* Any spell cast within the sphere or at a target within the sphere is suppressed and the spell slot is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within the sphere. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent suppressed counts against it.

**Rare: Denying Antimagic Field.** This spell�s range increases to 30 feet, but

your concentration on the spell ends when you move.

**Rare: Steadfast Antimagic Field.** Creatures that are within the area when the spell is cast gain temporary hit points equal to your level. These temporary hit points last while they are within the spell�s area.

## Antipathy/Sympathy

*8th-level (enchantment; compulsion)*

**Classes:** Druid, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 hour **Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Target:** Huge or smaller object, creature, or 200-foot cube

**Components:** V, S, M (flask of honey and vinegar)

**Duration:** 10 days

Designate a species or heritage of intelligent creature, such as dragons. The target now causes either antipathy or sympathy for the specified creatures for the duration of the spell. A creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect the first time it sees or comes within 60 feet of the target, every 24 hours thereafter, and whenever it ends its turn neither within 60 feet nor within sight of the target. When a designated creature successfully saves against the effects of the spell, it immediately understands it was under a magical effect and is immune to this spell�s effects for 1 minute.

*Antipathy:* When a designated creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened on a failure. While frightened the creature must use its movement to move away from the target until it can no longer see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target

and can no longer see it, it is no longer frightened until it can see the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

*Sympathy:* When a designated creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature uses its movement on each of its turns to move into the area or within reach of the target, and is unwilling to move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect.

**Rare: Fiendish Antipathy/Sympathy.** A fiend has disadvantage on its first saving throw against an effect caused by this spell.

## Arcane Eye

*4h-level (divination; arcane, scrying)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time**: 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Components**: V, S, M (a mushroom-shaped piece

of wood inside a universal joint) Duration: Concentration (1 hour)

You create an invisible, floating magical eye through which you can see. The eye has normal vision, darkvision to a range of 30 feet, and it can look in every direction.

You can use an action to move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction as long as it remains on the same plane of existence.

The eye can pass through openings as small as 1 inch across but otherwise its movement is blocked by solid barriers.

**Rare: Sharpshooting Arcane Eye.** Until the spell ends, you have advantage on

spell attacks you make against targets you can see with the eye.

## Arcane Hand

*5th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, protection)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Components:** V, S, M (gauntlet inlaid with copper tracery)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You create a Large, translucent hand made of force in an unoccupied space you can see.

The hand doesn�t fill its space and has AC 20, Strength 26 (+8), Dexterity 10 (+0), maneuver DC 18, and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. The spell ends early if it is dropped to 0 hit points.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then choose one of the following.

*Shove:* The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the hand pushes the creature in a direction of your choosing for up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to 5 times your spellcasting ability modifier, and remains within 5 feet of it.

*Smash:* Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within 5 feet of the hand. On a hit, the hand deals 4d8 force damage.

*Snatch:* The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the creature is

grappled by the hand. You can use a bonus action to crush a creature grappled by the hand, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

*Stop:* Until the hand is given another command it moves to stay between you and a creature of your choice, granting you three-quarters cover against the chosen creature. A creature with a Strength score of 26 or less cannot move through the hand�s space, and stronger creatures treat the hand as difficult terrain.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage from Smash increases by 2d8 and the damage from Snatch increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.

## Arcane Lock

*2nd-level (abjuration; arcane, protection)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** Closed entryway or container

**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gold, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Until dispelled or the target is broken

The target is sealed to all creatures except those you designate (who can open the object normally). Alternatively, you may choose a password that suppresses this spell for 1 minute when it is spoken within 5 feet of the target. The spell can also be suppressed for 10 minutes by casting *knock* on the target. Otherwise, the target cannot be opened normally and it is more difficult to break or force open, increasing the DC to break it or pick any locks on it by 10 (minimum DC 20).

**Cast at Higher Levels**. Increase the DC to force open the object or pick any locks on

the object by an additional 2 for each slot level above 2nd. Only a *knock* spell cast at a slot level equal to or greater than your arcane lock suppresses it.

## Arcane Muscles

*Cantrip (transmutation; arcane, enhancement,*

*transformation, unarmed)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 1 minute

Your muscles swell with arcane power. They�re too clumsy to effectively wield weapons but certainly strong enough for a powerful punch. Until the spell ends, you can choose to use your spellcasting ability score for Athletics checks, and for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.

## Arcane Riposte

*1st-level (evocation; arcane, attack)* **Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take

when a creature makes a melee attack against you

**Range:** Self **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

You respond to an incoming attack with a magically-infused attack of your own. Make a melee spell attack against the creature that attacked you. If you hit, the creature takes 3d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell deals an extra 1d6 damage for each slot level above 1st. When using a 4th-level or higher spell slot, you may choose to deal psychic, radiant, or necrotic damage. When using a 6th-level or higher spell slot, you may choose to deal force damage.

**Rare: Unsettling Arcane Riposte.** When you deal 10 or more damage, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn.

**Arcane Sword**

*7th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, force, summoning, weaponry)*

**Classes:** Bard, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Components:** V, S, M (miniature sword worth 250 gold)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You summon an insubstantial yet deadly sword to do your bidding.

Make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword, dealing 3d10 force damage on a hit.

You can use a bonus action on subsequent turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a space you can see and make an identical melee spell attack against a target.

**Rare: Bloody Arcane Sword.** The spell�s damage is reduced to 3d6 and when a creature is damaged by the spell it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer a level of fatigue.

## Arcanist�s Magic Aura

*2nd-level (illusion; arcane, obscurement, scrying)*

**Classes**: Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** Willing creature or an unattended object

**Components:** V, S, M (small patch of silk)

**Duration:** 24 hours (or until dispelled; see below)

Choose one or both of the following effects. When cast upon the same target with the same effect for 30 successive days, it lasts until it is dispelled.

*False Aura:* A magical target appears nonmagical, a nonmagical target appears magical, or you change a target�s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic of your choosing.

Additionally, you can choose to make a nonmagical item seem magical to any creature that handles the item.

*Masking Effect:* Choose a creature type. Spells and magical effects that detect creature types treat the target as if it were a creature of that type.

Additionally, you can choose to mask the target�s alignment trait (if it has one).

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You throw your head back and howl like a beast, embracing your most basic impulses. Until the spell ends your hair grows, your features become more feral, and sharp

claws grow on your fingers. You gain a +1 bonus to AC, your Speed increases by 10 feet, you have advantage on Perception checks, and your unarmed strikes deal 1d8 slashing damage. You may use your Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes, and treat your unarmed strikes as weapons with the finesse property.

If you are hit by a silvered weapon, you have disadvantage on your Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

# Astral Projection

**Components:** V, S, M (one jacinth worth 1,000 gold per creature affected and one ornately carved silver bar worth at least 100 gold per creature affected, all consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Varies

Until the spell ends, the targets leave their material bodies (unconscious, not aging or requiring food or air) and project nearly identical forms into the Astral Plane. These astral forms use the targets� game statistics and possessions.

While in astral form the targets each trail a tether, a silvery-white cord that fades into immateriality a foot behind them. As long as the tether is not destroyed, a target can find their way back to their material body. If it is cut�which requires an effect specifically stating that it cuts your tether�the target immediately dies. Otherwise, damage and

other effects on a target�s astral form have no effect on their material body either during this spell or after its duration ends. An astral form can travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through interplanar portals on the Astral Plane leading to any other plane.

When a target leaves the Astral Plane, their material body and possessions are transported along the tether, allowing them to freturnully intact to their body, with all their gear, as they enter the new plane.

The spell ends for all targets when you use an action to dismiss it, for an individual target when a successful *dispel magic* is cast upon its astral form or material body, or when either its material body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points. When the spell ends for a target and the tether is intact, the tether pulls the target�s astral form back to its material body, ending the suspended animation.

If the spell ends for you early, other targets are stranded in their astral forms until they drop to 0 hit points or leave the plane.

**Rare: Swift Astral Projection.** While in astral form your Speed is tripled and you can use a bonus action to Dash.

bad results)

This omen does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.

At the end of each of its turns, a banished creature can repeat the saving throw with a �1 penalty for each round it has spent banished, ending the banishment on a success. The banishment also ends if the spell ends early. If the spell is maintained for its maximum duration, a target native to this plane ends the banishment, while a target native to a different plane doesn�t return.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration of banishment on a native creature increases by 1 round for each slot level above 4th.

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

On the round you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can choose one of the following effects. When you choose a different effect, the current one ends.

*Flood:* The standing water level in the area rises by up to 20 feet. The flood water spills onto land if the area includes a shore, and otherwise you create a

20-foot-tall wave. The wave travels across the area in a direction of your choice and crashes down, carrying Huge or smaller vehicles to the other side and

capsizing such vehicles on a roll of 1 on a 1d4. The wave repeats on the start of your next turn while this effect continues.

*Part Water:* You create a 20-foot wide trench spanning the area with walls of water to either side. When this effect ends, the trench slowly refills over the course of the next round.

*Redirect Flow:* Flowing water flows in your choice of direction, including up. Once the water moves beyond the spell�s area, it resumes its regular flow based on the terrain.

*Whirlpool:* If the affected body of water is at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, a whirlpool forms within the area in a 50-foot wide cone that is 25 feet long. Creatures and objects that are in the area and within 25 feet of the whirlpool must succeed on an Athletics check against your spell save DC or be pulled 10 feet toward it. Once within the whirlpool, checks made to swim out of it have disadvantage. When a creature first enters the whirlpool on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and be pulled into the center of the whirlpool. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn�t pulled.

## Corpse Explosion

*1st-level (evocation; poison, thunder)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** One corpse within range **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Constitution halves and negates poisoned

A corpse explodes in a poisonous cloud. Each creature in a 10-foot radius of the corpse must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 thunder damage and is poisoned for 1 minute on a failed save, or it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned on a successful one. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** You target an additional corpse for every 2 slot levels above 1st.

## Counterspell

*3rd-level (abjuration; arcane, negation)* **Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take

when you see a creature within range cast a spell

**Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Components:** S **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 2nd-level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 3rd-level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (DC 10 + the spell�s level). On a success, the creature�s spell fails and has no effect, but the creature can use its reaction to reshape the fraying magic and cast another spell with the same casting time as the original spell. This new spell must be cast at a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, or if both spells use the same level spell slot an opposed spellcasting ability check is made.

## Create Food and Water

*3rd-level (conjuration; divine, utility)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Components:** V, S, M (serving of fresh food or water)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Your magic turns one serving of food or water into 3 Supply. The food is nourishing but bland, and the water is clean. After 24 hours uneaten food spoils and water affected or created by this spell goes bad.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** You create an additional 2 Supply for each slot level above 3rd.

## Create or Destroy Water

*1st-level (transmutation; divine, utility, water)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Area:** Open container or 30-foot cube

**Components:** V, S, M (drop of water to create water or grains of sand to destroy it)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one of the following.

*Create Water:* You fill the area with up to 10 gallons of nonpotable water. Alternatively, the water falls as rain that extinguishes exposed flames in the area.

*Destroy Water:* You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in the target. Alternatively, you destroy fog in the area.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** For each slot level above 1st, you either create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet.

## Create Undead

*6th-level (necromancy; arcane, divine, undead)*

**Classes:** Cleric, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** Up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids

**Components:** V, S, M (each corpse requires a clay pot filled with grave dirt, a clay pot filled with brackish water, and a black onyx stone worth 150 gold)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You reanimate the targets as undead and transform them into ghouls under your control. This spell cannot be cast in sunlight.

While it is within 120 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead. When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.

The undead is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any commands. You must cast this spell on the undead before the spell ends to maintain control of it for another 24 hours. Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 3 undead you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** You create or reassert control over one additional ghoul for each slot level above 6th. Alternatively, when using an 8th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 2 ghasts or wights, or when using a 9th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 3 ghasts or wights, or 2 mummies. When commanding more than 3 undead they make group attack rolls (see Combat).

## Creation

*5th-level (illusion; arcane, shadow)* **Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Components:** V, S, M (tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create)

**Duration:** Special

You weave raw magic into a mundane physical object that fits in a 5-foot cube. The object must be of a shape and material you are familiar with. Using the object as a material component for another spell causes that spell to fail.

The spell�s duration is determined by the material created. An object composed of multiple materials uses the shortest duration.

*Cast at Higher Levels.* The size of the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

|  |  |

| **TABLE: CREATION** | |
| **MATERIAL** | **DURATION** |
| Vegetable matter | 1 day |
| Stone or crystal | 12 hours |
| Precious metals | 1 hour |

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (set of brass knuckles)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Special

Your fist reverberates with destructive energy. As part of casting the spell, make a melee spell attack against a creature or

object within 5 feet. If you hit, the target of your attack takes 7d6 thunder damage, and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of its next turn. This spell�s damage is doubled against objects and structures.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell deals an extra 1d6 of thunder damage for each slot level above 3rd.

## Cure Wounds

## Dancing Lights

*Cantrip (evocation; arcane, utility)* **Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Components:** V, S, M (bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) You create up to four hovering lights,

which can appear as torches or other illuminations, or one glowing Medium humanoid form. Each sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

You can use a bonus action to move the lights up to 60 feet so long as each remains within 20 feet of another. A dancing light is extinguished when it is no longer within the spell�s range.

## Darklight

*3rd-level (evocation; utility)* **Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (torch coated with pitch)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You create an enchanted flame that surrounds your hand and produces no heat, but sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius around you and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Only you and up to 6 creatures of your choice can see this light.

**Rare: Darklight.** During the spell�s duration, you can use an action to kindle this light on a willing creature�s hand, sharing the effect with them. When the spell�s duration ends, or when any of the flames are dispelled, the spell ends.

## Darkness

*2nd-level (evocation; arcane, shadow)* **Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Area:** 15-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

Magical darkness blocks darkvision and nonmagical light in the area. The darkness spreads around corners, but completely covering or enclosing the source of the darkness with an opaque object blocks the

darkness. If the area of darkness overlaps with magical light created by a 2nd- or lower level spell, the spell that created the light ends.

When cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the darkness emanates from that object, moving with it.

**Rare: Blinding Darkness.** A creature that moves out of the darkness must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded by this spell can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Darkvision

*2nd-level (transmutation; arcane, nature, senses)*

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One willing creature

**Components:** V, S, M (pinch of dried carrot or an agate)

**Duration:** 8 hours

The target gains darkvision to 60 feet.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The range of the target�s darkvision increases to 120 feet. In addition, for each slot level above 3rd you may choose an additional target.

## Daylight

*3rd-level (evocation; arcane, divine, nature)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, herald, sorcerer

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Area:** 60-foot radius sphere **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 1 hour

Magical light fills the area. The area is brightly lit and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet. If any of the light overlaps with magical darkness created by a 3rd- or lower level spell, the spell that created the darkness ends.

When cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the light shines from it, moving with it. Completely covering the object with something that is not transparent blocks the light.

## Deadweight

*2nd-level (transmutation; mobility, transformation)*

**Classes:** Druid, herald, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Medium or smaller object

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

The target object�s weight is greatly increased. Any creature holding the object must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop it. A creature that doesn�t drop the object has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn as it figures out the object�s new balance.

Creatures that attempt to push, drag, or lift the object must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC to do so.

## Death Ward

*4th-level (abjuration; divine, protection)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One creature **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 8 hours

The first time damage would reduce the target to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 hit

point. If an effect would kill the target instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect does not affect the target. The spell ends immediately after either of these conditions occur.

## Delayed Blast Fireball

*7th-level (evocation; arcane, fire)* **Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Area:** 20-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, S, M (tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

**Saving Throw:** Dexterity halves

A glowing bead of light flies from you and hovers at the center of the area until you end the spell�either because your concentration is broken or because you choose to end it�and then detonates. Each creature in the area takes 12d6 fire damage. The fire spreads around corners, and it damages and ignites any flammable unattended objects in the area.

If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the bead is touched before the spell ends, the creature touching the bead makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the bead detonates. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet, moving the area with it, and the bead then detonates.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.

## Demiplane

*8th-level (conjuration; arcane, planar)*

**Classes:** Warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** Solid flat surface **Components:** S **Duration:** 1 hour

You create a shadowy door on the target, large enough for Medium creatures. The door leads to a demiplane that appears as an empty, 30-foot-cube chamber made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears from both sides, trapping any creatures or objects inside the demiplane.

When you cast this spell, you can either create a new demiplane, recreate the door to a demiplane you have previously created, or make a door leading to another caster�s demiplane whose nature or contents you are familiar with.

## Detect Evil and Good

*1st-level (divination; divine, senses)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Special (30-foot radius) **Target:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

You attempt to sense the presence of otherworldly forces. You automatically know if there is a place or object within range that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. In addition, on the round you cast it and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you may make a Wisdom (Religion) check against the passive Deception score of any aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead creature within range. On a success, you sense the creature�s presence, as well as where the creature is located.

The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

## Detect Magic

*1st-level (divination; arcane, divine, nature, senses)*

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, druid, herald, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual) **Range:** Special (30-foot radius) **Target:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

You automatically sense whether or not there is any magic within range. You can use an action to see an aura around any visible creatures or objects that are magical or subject to a magical effect within range, as well as at least one school of magic (if any) related to such magical effects.

The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 2nd-level spell slot or higher, the spell no longer requires your concentration. When using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 1 hour. When using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours.

## Detect Poison and Disease

*1st-level (divination; divine, nature, senses)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, herald **Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual) **Range:** Special (30-foot radius) **Target:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (yew leaf)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can attempt to sense the presence of poisons, poisonous creatures, and disease by making a Perception check. On a success you identify the type of each poison or disease within range. Typically noticing and identifying a poison or disease is a DC 10 check, but the Narrator may use DC 15 for uncommon afflictions, DC 20 for rare afflictions, or DC 25 for afflictions that are truly unique. On a failed check, this casting of the spell cannot sense that specific poison or disease.

The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

## Detect Thoughts

*2nd-level (divination; arcane, senses, telepathy)*

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Special (30-foot radius) **Target:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (copper piece) **Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) **Saving Throw:** Wisdom (special)

On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can probe the mind of a creature you can see within range. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or less or that don�t speak any languages are unaffected. On a failed save, you learn the creature�s surface thoughts�what is most on its mind in that moment. On a successful save, you fail to read the creature�s thoughts and can�t attempt to probe its mind for the duration.

Conversation naturally shapes the course of a creature�s thoughts and what it is thinking

about may change based on questions verbally directed at it.

Once you have read a creature�s surface thoughts, you can use an action to probe deeper into its mind. The creature makes a second Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, you fail to read the creature�s deeper thoughts and the spell ends. On a failure, you gain insight into the creature�s motivations, emotional state, worries, and obsessions. The creature then becomes aware you are probing its mind and can use an action to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check, ending the spell if it succeeds.

Additionally, you can use an action to scan for creatures within range that you can�t see but that have an Intelligence of 4 or higher. Once you detect the presence of a creature, so long as it remains within range you can attempt to read its thoughts as described above (even if you can�t see it).

The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 5th-level spell slot, increase the spell�s range to 1 mile. When using a 7th-level spell slot, increase the range to 10 miles. When using a 9th-level spell slot, increase the range to 1,000 miles.

**Rare: Specific Detect Thoughts.** You can scan the thoughts of all creatures within range and locate one creature currently thinking about a single subject you choose when you cast the spell. You can read its thoughts as described in the spell�s description. This spell does not reveal the creature having these thoughts.

## Dimension Door

*4th-level (conjuration; arcane, teleportation)*

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Special (500 feet) **Components:** V **Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport to any place you can see, visualize, or describe by stating distance and direction.

You can bring along objects that don�t exceed your carrying capacity. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller within 5 feet of you, provided it isn�t carrying gear beyond its carrying capacity.

If you would arrive in an occupied space the spell fails, and you and any creature with you each take 4d6 force damage.

## Disguise Self

*1st-level (illusion; arcane, obscurement)* **Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you and your gear are cloaked by an illusory disguise that makes you appear like another creature of your general size and body type, making changes including but not limited to: your heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex, and any other distinguishing features. You cannot disguise yourself as a creature of a different size category, and your limb structure remains the same.

Illusory changes in shape can be discovered by touch. To see through your

disguise without touching it, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, this spell functions identically to the *seeming* spell, except the spell�s duration is 10 minutes.

## Disintegrate

*6th-level (transmutation; arcane, attack, transformation)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Target:** One creature, object, or creation of magical force

**Components:** V, S, M (lodestone and pinch of dust)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Dexterity negates

You shoot a glowing ray at the target. It takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points is obliterated, leaving behind nothing but dust, along with anything it was wearing or carrying (except magic items). Only *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell can restore it to life.

This spell automatically disintegrates nonmagical objects and creations of magical force that are Large-sized or smaller. Larger objects and creations of magical force have a 10-foot-cube portion disintegrated instead. Magic items are unaffected.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.

## Dispel Evil and Good

*5th-level (abjuration; divine, protection)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth 25 gold)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

Until the spell ends, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using an action to do either of the following.

*Mental Resistance:* Choose up to 3 friendly creatures within 60 feet. Each of those creatures that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead may make an immediate saving throw with advantage against the condition or possession, ending it on a success.

*Retribution:* Make a melee spell attack against a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within reach. On a hit, the creature takes 7d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) and is stunned until the beginning of your next turn.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** Mental Resistance targets one additional creature for each slot level above 5th, and Retribution�s damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

**Rare: Dismissal.** The spell also affects aberrations and dragons.

## Dispel Magic

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Target:** One creature, object, or magical effect

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** instantaneous

You scour the magic from your target. Any spell cast on the target ends if it was cast with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower. For spells using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, make a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell�s level for each one, ending the effect on a success.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** You automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the level of the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot used to cast dispel magic.

**Rare: Confiscating Dispel Magic.** When you dispel a spell that was cast using a spell slot at least 2 levels lower than the one used for this spell, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot of equal level to the dispelled spell and immediately cast it at a new target.

## Divination

*4th-level (divination; communication, divine, knowledge)*

**Classes:** Cleric, warlock **Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual) **Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You ask your higher powers a single question about something that will (or could) happen in the next 7 days. The Narrator offers a truthful reply, which may be cryptic or even nonverbal as appropriate to the being in question. The reply does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases. The Narrator makes the following

roll in secret: second casting�25%, third casting�50%, fourth casting�75%, fifth casting�100%.

## Divine Favor

*1st-level (evocation; attack, divine, radiant, weaponry)*

* Fewer than 40 hit points: blinded and deafened for 10 minutes.
* Fewer than 30 hit points: stunned, blinded, and deafened for 1 hour.
* Fewer than 20 hit points: killed.

Additionally, when a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend is affected by this spell it is immediately forced back to its home plane and for 24 hours it is unable to return to your current plane by any means less powerful than a *wish* spell. Such a creature does not suffer this effect if it is already on its plane of origin.

**Rare: Imprecating Divine Word.** The spell�s additional effect also targets aberrations and dragons, sending them to a harmless demiplane.

## Dominate Beast

*4th-level (enchantment; beasts, compulsion, nature)*

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** One beast **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates

You assert control over the target�s mind and it is charmed for the duration. If it is engaged in combat with you or creatures friendly to you, it has advantage on its saving throw.

Until the charmed condition ends, you establish a telepathic link with it while you are on the same plane. You may issue commands through this link and the target does its best to obey. No action is required to issue commands, which can be a simple and general course of action such as �Attack that target,� �Go over there,� or �Bring me that object.� Without commands the target only defends itself. The target continues to follow a command until its task is complete.

You can use your action to assume direct control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, you decide all of the target�s

actions and movements. While a target is directly controlled in this way, you can also cause it to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new saving throw against the spell, ending the spell on a success.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell�s duration is extended:

5th-level�Concentration (10 minutes),

6th-level�Concentration (1 hour),

7th-level�Concentration (8 hours).

**Components:** V, S, M (broken violin string and a wasp�s stinger)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) **Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates You frighten the target by echoing its

movements with ominous music and terrifying sound effects. It takes 1d4 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you until the spell ends.

At the end of each of the creature�s turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 psychic damage.

You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

**Rare: Subtle Dramatic Sting.** When you cast this spell, make a Performance check opposed by the target�s Perception check.

Each round at the start of its turn, the target gains an expertise die on a Perception check made against the result of your Performance check to realize it has been targeted by a spell.

## Dream

**Classes:** Bard, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** Special

**Target:** One creature that is known to you and on the same plane

**Components:** V, S, M (sand, ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)

**Duration:** 8 hours

Until the spell ends, you manipulate the dreams of another creature. You designate a messenger, which may be you or a willing creature you touch, to enter a trance. The messenger remains aware of its surroundings while in the trance but cannot take actions or move. During the duration of the spell, the messenger knows when the target is asleep. The messenger can end the trance at any time, ending the spell.

While the target is asleep the messenger can appear in its dreams and can speak and act in the dream. The messenger can also manipulate the dream, creating objects, landscapes, and various other sensory sensations. The target remembers the dream in perfect detail when it wakes.

You can choose to let the messenger terrorize the target. The messenger can deliver a message of 10 words or fewer and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you have a portion of the target�s body (some hair or a drop of blood) it has disadvantage on its saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the messenger�s fearful aspect create a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target�s sleep and prevents it from benefiting from the rest. In addition, upon waking the target suffers a level of fatigue or strife (your choice), up to a maximum of 3 in either condition.

Creatures that don�t sleep or don�t dream (such as elves) cannot be targeted by this spell.

**Rare: Terrible Dream.** When you choose to terrorize a target, if it fails its saving throw it suffers both a level of fatigue and strife. You may also convey a message of up to 25 words as part of terrorizing it (rather than 10 words).

* You create an instantaneous, harmless illusory effect such as the sound of running water, birdsong, or the smell of mulch. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
* You ignite or extinguish a small fire.

**Rare: Crystal Pillar.** The pillar summoned by this spell is made of translucent crystal. If this spell causes an attack to miss, the attack hits the pillar instead. If this pillar is destroyed, every creature within 5 feet of it takes 2d6 piercing damage.

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

Until the spell ends, tremors shake the area and anything in contact with it.

The ground in the spell�s area becomes difficult terrain as it warps and cracks.

Additionally, any creature that is concentrating on a spell while in contact with the ground in the spell�s area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each of your turns, each creature in contact with the ground in the spell�s area must

make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

At the Narrator�s discretion, this spell may have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area.

*Fissures:* At the start of your next turn after you cast the spell, roll 1d6. This number of 1d10 � 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide fissures bisect the area at your choice of locations. A creature standing on a fissure makes a Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failure and moving to the edge of the fissure on a success.

A structure automatically collapses if a fissure opens beneath it (see below).

*Structures:* A structure in contact with the ground in the spell�s area takes 50 bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is active. A structure reduced to 0 hit points this way collapses.

Creatures within half the distance of a collapsing structure�s height must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d6 bludgeoning damage, be knocked prone, and be buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Acrobatics or Athletics check as an action to escape. A creature inside (instead of near) a collapsing structure has disadvantage on its saving throw. The Narrator can adjust the DC higher or lower depending on the composition of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn�t fall prone or become buried.

**Rare: Tempestuous Earthquake.** The spell fills the area with violent winds. A flying creature halves its speed while in the area and makes a Dexterity saving throw at the start of each of its turns or falls prone.

When a creature starts its turn in the cube or enters the cube for the first time on its turn it must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 5d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.

As a bonus action, you can move the cube up to 10 feet in any direction to a space you can see. The cube cannot be made to pass through other creatures in this way.

You cause the target to grow or shrink. An unwilling target may attempt a saving throw to resist the spell.

If the target is a creature, all items worn or carried by it also change size with it, but an item dropped by the target immediately returns to normal size.

*Enlarge:* Until the spell ends, the target�s size increases by one size category. Its size doubles in all dimensions and its weight increases eightfold. The target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Its weapons also enlarge, dealing an extra 1d4 damage.

*Reduce:* Until the spell ends, the target�s size decreases one size category. Its size is halved in all dimensions and its weight decreases to one-eighth of its normal value.

While the target is thrashing, any creature inside or within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10+5 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. When the spell ends, the target returns to its previous state, magically repairing any damage it sustained during the spell�s duration.

Until the spell ends or you use an action to end it, you enter the region of the Ethereal Plane that borders your current plane.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can move in any direction, but vertical movement is considered difficult terrain. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything looks desaturated and you can see no further than 60 feet.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other objects and

creatures on that plane, so you can pass through obstacles on your plane of origin. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane can�t perceive you without special magical abilities.

When the spell ends, you return to your plane of origin in the spot you currently occupy. If you share the space of a solid object or creature, you move to the nearest unoccupied space and take 10 force damage for each 5 feet you are moved.

*Asleep:* The target falls unconscious, waking if it takes damage or if a creature uses an action to rouse it.

*Panicked:* The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, it uses its action to take the Dash action and move away from you if it can. If the target is at least 60 feet away from you and can�t see you, this effect ends.

*Sickened:* The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

**Rare: Devious Eyebite.** Your eyes glow with a soft purple light. You gain an additional option:

Metal or mineral materials can form an object up to Medium size (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of any objects made with the spell is equivalent to the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or magic items can�t be created or used as materials with this spell, nor can items whose creation require artisan�s tool proficiencies you don�t possess.

**Rare: Skilled Fabricate.** Spectral artisan�s tools of your choosing appear in your hands as you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you gain proficiency with these tools. Each time you cast it, you may choose a different set of tools.

Any attack roll against an affected object or creature has advantage. The spell also negates the benefits of invisibility on affected creatures and objects.

## Faithful Hound

The hound is invisible except to you and invulnerable to all harm. When a Small or larger creature enters the area without speaking a password you have chosen, the hound starts barking. The hound sees invisible creatures, can see into the Ethereal Plane, and is immune to illusions.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound makes a bite attack against a hostile creature of your choice that is within the area, using your spell attack bonus and dealing 4d8 piercing damage on a hit.

**Rare: Feast of Fear.** The spell affects every creature within 30 feet of you.

When you first cast the spell and again at the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to the number of frightened creatures you can see within 30 feet of you.

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Your familiar, a spirit that takes the form of any CR 0 beast of Small or Tiny size, appears in an unoccupied space within range. It has the statistics of the chosen form, but is your choice of a celestial, fey, or fiend (instead of a beast).

Your familiar is an independent creature that rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn in combat (but cannot take the Attack action). However, it is loyal to you and always obeys your commands.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes without a trace. Casting the spell again causes it to reappear.

You are able to communicate telepathically with your familiar when it is within 100 feet. As long as it is within this range, you can use an action to see through your familiar�s eyes and hear through its ears until the

beginning of your next turn, gaining the benefit of any of its special senses. During this time, you are blind and deaf to your body�s surroundings.

You can use an action to either permanently dismiss your familiar or temporarily dismiss it to a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. While it is temporarily dismissed, you can use an action to call it back, causing it to appear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

You can�t have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can cause it to adopt a different form.

When you cast a spell with a range of Touch and your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can deliver the spell as if it was the spellcaster. Your familiar must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, use your attack bonus for the spell.

Its statistics change in the following ways:

* Its type is your choice of celestial, fey, or fiend.
* Its size is your choice of Medium or Large.
* Its Intelligence is 6.
* You can communicate with it telepathically while it�s within 1 mile.
* It understands one language that you speak.

While mounted on your steed, when you cast a spell that targets only yourself, you may also target the steed.

When you use an action to dismiss the steed, or when it drops to 0 hit points, it temporarily disappears. Casting this spell again resummons the steed, fully healed and with all conditions removed. You can�t summon a different steed unless you spend an action to release your current steed from its bond, permanently dismissing it.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The steed has an additional 20 hit points for each slot level above 2nd. When using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you may grant the steed either a swim speed or fly speed equal to its base Speed.

some observable action or quality and not related to mechanics like level, hitpoints, or class, and the Narrator must agree to it.

A *dispel magic* only dispels an *imprisonment* if it is cast using a 9th-level spell slot and targets the prison or the special component used to create the prison.

While asleep, the target is subjected to dreams or nightmares specified by you and created by the target�s own subconscious. These nightmares seem more real than the target�s memories, which become dreamlike and false, allowing you to implant false narratives, experiences, or episodes in the target�s mind, changing the target�s nature and turning allies into enemies or heroes into villains. Only a *wish* or similarly powerful effect can restore the target�s memories.

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Target:** One creature

**Components:** V, S, M (hair, fingernail clippings, or some other piece of the target)

**Duration:** Special

You infect your target with an arcane disease. At any time after you cast this spell, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as the target, you can use an action to deal 7d10 necrotic damage to the target. If this damage would reduce the target to 0 hit points, you can choose to leave it with 1 hit point. As part of dealing the damage, you may expend a 7th-level spell slot to sustain the disease. Otherwise, the spell ends. The spell ends when you die.

Casting *remove curse, greater restoration,* or *heal* on the target allows the target to make a Constitution saving throw against the disease. Otherwise the disease can only be cured by a *wish* spell.

A weapon formed from the essence of Hell appears in your hands. You must use two hands to wield the weapon. If you let go of the weapon, it disappears and the spell ends.

When you cast the spell, choose either a flame fork or ice spear. While the spell lasts, you can use an action to make a melee spell attack with the weapon against a creature within 10 feet of you. On a hit, you deal 5d8 damage of a type determined by the weapon�s form. On a critical hit, you inflict an additional effect.

In addition, on a hit with the *infernal weapon*, you can end the spell early to inflict an automatic critical hit.

**Flame Fork.** The weapon deals fire damage. On a critical hit, the target catches fire, taking 2d6 ongoing fire damage.

**Ice Spear.** The weapon deals cold damage. On a critical hit, for 1 minute the target is slowed. At the end of each of its turns a slowed creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by an *infernal weapon* immediately dies in a gruesome fashion. For example, a creature killed by an ice spear might freeze solid, then shatter into a thousand pieces. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of the creature and who can see it when it dies must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

**Rare: Malevolent Infernal Weapon.** The spell may take a third form.

*Malevolent Maul.* The weapon deals psychic damage. On a critical hit, the target is confused. At the end of each of its turns, a confused creature can make an Intelligence saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A cloud of biting, stinging insects lightly obscures the area, spreads around corners, and is considered difficult terrain. When the cloud appears and a creature is in it, when a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn, or when a creature ends its turn within the cloud it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

Until the spell ends, a mystical bond connects the target and the precious stone used to cast this spell. Any time after, you may crush the stone and speak the name of the item, summoning it instantly into your hand no matter the physical, metaphysical, or planar distance, at which point the spell ends. If another creature is holding the item when the stone is crushed, the item is not summoned to you. Instead, the spell grants you the knowledge of who possesses it and a general idea of the creature�s location.

Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different precious stone.

*Dispel magic* or a similar effect targeting the stone ends the spell.

**Rare: Reinforcement Instant Summons.** The spell can target a willing creature and uses a precious statue carved to resemble the target. This material component costs 1,000 gold per Hit Die that the creature possesses. Once cast, you may summon the target the same way that you would summon an item. If the target is asleep, it is awakened when summoned. The target may decline the summons, in which case you are granted a general idea of the target�s current location.

Attacks made against the target have advantage. On each of its turns, the target can use an action to repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a successful save.

When you target an object held shut by an *arcane lock* cast at its base level, that spell ceases to have any effect for 10 minutes. .

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The level of the arcane lock you can suppress increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd. In addition, if the level of your knock spell is 2 or more levels higher than that of the arcane lock, you may dispel the arcane lock instead of suppressing it.

up-to-date research, lore forgotten in old tales, or even previously unknown information. The spell gives you additional, more detailed information if you already have some knowledge of the target. The spell will not return any information for items not of legendary renown.

On subsequent turns, you can use your action to alter the target�s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction so long as it remains within range. If you have targeted yourself you may move up or down as part of your movement.

While within range you can use an action to move the illusion elsewhere within range. As the image moves you may also change its appearance to make the movement seem natural (like a roc moving its wings to fly) and also change the nonvisual elements of the illusion for the same reason (like the sound of beating wings as the roc flies).

Any physical interaction allows a creature to recognize the image is an illusion. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion.

When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature.

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Target:** Up to twelve creatures that can hear and understand you

**Components:** V, M (miniature bottle of wine and some soap)

**Duration:** 24 hours

**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates Creatures that cannot be charmed are

immune to this spell. Suggest an activity phrased in a sentence or two. The targets are magically influenced to follow that course of activity. The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable. Asking the targets to perform an action that is obviously harmful to them ends the spell.

A target carries out the activity suggested by you as well as it can for the duration of the spell or until the target has carried out the activity.

You may specify trigger conditions that cause a target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.

Any damage done to a target by you or an ally ends the spell for that creature.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When cast using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration of the spell increases to 10 days. When cast using an 8th-level spell slot, the duration increases to 30 days. When cast using a 9th-level spell slot, the duration increases to a year and a day.

## Maze

*8th-level (conjuration; arcane, chaos, compulsion, planar)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** One creature **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

The target is banished to a complex maze on its own demiplane, and remains there for the duration or until the target succeeds in escaping.

The target can use an action to make an Intelligence saving throw to solve the maze. On a successful save it escapes and the spell ends. A creature with Labyrinthine Recall (or a similar trait) automatically succeeds on its save.

When the spell ends the target reappears in the space it occupied before the spell was cast, or the closest unoccupied space.

## Meld Into Stone

*3rd-level (transmutation; nature, obscurement, shapechanging, transformation)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** A stone object or surface large enough to contain your body

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

Until the spell ends, you meld yourself and your carried equipment into the target stone. Using your movement, you may enter the stone from any point you can touch. No

trace of your presence is visible or detectable by nonmagical senses.

Within the stone, you can�t see outside it and have disadvantage on Perception checks made to hear beyond it. You are aware of time passing, and may cast spells upon yourself. You may use your movement only to step out of the target where you entered it, ending the spell.

If the target is damaged such that its shape changes and you no longer fit within it, you are expelled and take 6d6 bludgeoning damage. Complete destruction of the target, or its transmutation into another substance, expels you and you take 50 bludgeoning damage. When expelled you fall prone into the closest unoccupied space near your entrance point.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a

5th-level spell slot, you may reach out of the target to make spell attacks or ranged weapon attacks without ending the spell.

You make these attacks with disadvantage.

**Rare: Mobile Meld Into Stone.** Until the spell ends, you gain a burrow speed of 10 feet.

## Mending

*Cantrip (transmutation; arcane, transformation, utility)*

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, druid, herald, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch **Target:** One object

**Components:** V, S, M (fragment of equine bone)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You repair a single rip or break in the target object (for example, a cracked goblet, torn page, or ripped robe). The break must be smaller than 1 foot in all dimensions. The spell leaves no trace that the object was damaged.

Magic items and constructs may be repaired in this way, but their magic is not restored. You gain an expertise die on maintenance checks if you are able to cast this spell on the item you are treating.

## Mental Grip

*2nd-level (conjuration; affliction)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Components:** V, S, M (rusted manacle) **Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You conjure extensions of your own mental fortitude to keep your foes at bay. For the spell�s duration, you can use an action to attempt to grapple a creature within range by making a concentration check against its maneuver DC.

On its turn, a target grappled in this way can use an action to attempt to escape the grapple, using your spell save DC instead of your maneuver DC. Successful escape attempts do not break your concentration on the spell.

## Message

*Cantrip (transmutation; arcane, communication)*

**Classes:** Bard, herald, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Target:** One creature

**Components:** V, S, M (scrap of paper)

**Duration:** 1 round

You point and whisper your message at the target. It alone hears the message and may reply in a whisper audible only to you.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and are certain it is beyond the barrier. The spell is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, or a thin sheet of lead.

The spell moves freely around corners or through openings.

## Meteor Swarm

*9th-level (evocation; affliction, arcane, attack,*

*fire, storm)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Special (1 mile)

**Area:** Four 40-foot radius spheres

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Dexterity halves Scorching spheres of flame strike the

ground at 4 different points within range. The effects of a sphere reach around corners. Creatures and objects in the area take 14d6 fire damage and 14d6 bludgeoning damage, and flammable unattended objects catch on fire. If a creature is in the area of more than one sphere, it is affected only once.

**Rare: Decisive Meteor Swarm.** A creature that takes 50 or more damage is knocked prone. A creature that takes 100 or more damage is stunned until the end of its next turn and knocked prone.

## Mind Blank

*8th-level (abjuration; arcane, negation)*

**Classes:** Bard, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One willing creature **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 24 hours

The target is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would read its emotions or thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition.

This immunity extends even to the *wish* spell, and magical effects or spells of similar power that would affect the target�s mind or gain information about it.

## Mindshield

*4th-level (abjuration; protection, psychic)* **Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch **Target:** One creature **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

The target has resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws made to resist being charmed or frightened.

## Minor Illusion

*Cantrip (illusion; arcane, chaos)* **Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Area:** 5-foot cube

**Components:** S, M (tinderbox and small mirror)

**Duration:** 1 minute

This spell creates a sound or image of an object. The illusion disappears if dismissed or you cast the spell again.

You may create any sound you choose, ranging in volume from a whisper to a scream. You may choose one sound for the duration or change them at varying points before the spell ends. Sounds are audible outside the spell�s area.

Visual illusions may replicate any image and remain within the spell�s area, but cannot create sound, light, smell, or other sensory effects.

The image is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction as physical objects and creatures pass through it. An Investigation check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion.

When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature.

## Mirage Arcane

*7th-level (illusion; arcane, chaos, nature, obscurement, terrain, transformation)*

**Classes:** Druid, wizard **Casting Time:** 10 minutes **Range:** Special (sight)

**Area:** Special (1-mile square)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain within the spell�s area appear as another kind of terrain, tricking all senses (including touch). The general

shape of the terrain remains the same, however.

Structures may be altered, or added where there are none. Creatures are not disguised, concealed, or added by the spell.

The illusion can be physically interacted with. Clear terrain can become difficult terrain, and vice versa. Any part of the illusory terrain such as a boulder, or water collected from an illusory stream, disappears immediately upon leaving the spell�s area.

Creatures with truesight see through the illusion, but are not immune to its effects. They may know that the overgrown path is in fact a well maintained road, but are still impeded by illusory rocks and branches.

## Mirror Image

*2nd-level (illusion; arcane, chaos, obscurement)*

**Classes:** Warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 1 minute

A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear, sharing your space. These copies move with you and mimic your behavior, creating confusion as to which is real. You can use an action to dismiss them.

Each time you�re targeted by a creature�s attack, roll a d20 to see if it targets you or a copy.

With 3 copies, a roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted. With two copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets the copy.

A copy�s AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and when it is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed. It may be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. All other damage and effects have no impact.

Attacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have blindsight, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a

5th-level spell slot, the duration increases to concentration (1 hour).

**Rare: Blinding Mirror Image.** When one of your illusory copies is destroyed, it explodes in a brilliant flash of light. A creature that destroys an illusory copy makes a Constitution saving throw or is blinded until the start of its next turn.

## Mislead

*5th-level (illusion; arcane, chaos, obscurement,*

*transformation)* **Classes:** Bard, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

You become invisible. Simultaneously, an illusory copy of you appears where you�re standing. This invisibility ends when you cast a spell but the copy lasts until the spell ends.

You can use an action to move your copy up to twice your Speed, have it speak, make gestures, or behave however you�d like.

You may see and hear through your copy. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to swap from seeing through your copy�s senses or your own, and vice versa. While using your copy�s senses you are blind and deaf to your body�s surroundings.

The copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects and creatures pass through it.

## Misty Step

*2nd-level (conjuration; arcane, chaos, movement, teleportation)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** Self **Components:** V **Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see, disappearing and reappearing in a swirl of shimmering mist.

**Rare: Elusive Misty Step.** Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you are made with disadvantage.

## Modify Memory

*5th-level (enchantment; communication, compulsion, utility)*

**Classes:** Bard, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet) **Target:** One creature **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates

The target has advantage on its saving throw if you are in combat with it. The target becomes charmed and incapacitated, though it can still hear you. Until the spell ends, any memories of an event that took place within the last 24 hours and lasted 10 minutes or less may be altered.

Altering memories must adhere to the following parameters:

* You may destroy the memory, have the target recall the event with perfect clarity, change specific details, or create a new memory that matches the timeframe and length. The target fills in gaps in details.
* you must speak to the target in a language you both know to modify its memories and describe how the memory is changed
* The memory must be logical and plausible to the creature or they are able to simply dismiss it as an obviously faulty memory
* Modified memories will not necessarily change a creature�s behavior, especially if conflicts with the creature�s personality, beliefs, etc

The spell automatically ends if the target takes any damage or if it is targeted by another spell. If the spell ends before you have finished modifying its memories, the

alteration fails. Otherwise, the alteration is complete when the spell ends and only *greater restoration* or *remove curse* can restore the memory.

There may be events that are unforgettable and utterly fundamental to a creature�s existence. After such memories are modified, they can be remembered correctly when another creature succeeds on a Persuasion check to stir the target�s memories. This check is made with disadvantage if the creature does not have indisputable proof on hand that is relevant to the altered memory.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a

6th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 7 days ago. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 30 days ago. When using an 8th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 1 year ago. When using a 9th-level spell slot, any event can be altered.

## Moonbeam

*2nd-level (evocation; nature, radiant)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Area:** 5-foot radius cylinder that is 40 feet high

**Components:** V, S, M (moonseed seeds and a piece of feldspar)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

**Saving Throw:** Constitution (special)

A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while within the spell�s light.

On your turn, you may use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

**Rare: Cursed Moonbeam.** An ominous moon of darkness appears above the target location. The cursed moon emanates no light and deals necrotic damage as grasping shadows tear into creatures in the spell�s area. On a failed saving throw, a creature�s speed is halved until the start of its next turn.

Celestial creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw in addition to shapechangers.

## Move Earth

*6th-level (transmutation; earth, nature, terrain, utility)*

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Area:** Square of clay, dirt, or sand up to 40 feet on a side

**Components:** V, S, M (iron blade and a bag of mixed soils)

**Duration:** Concentration (2 hours)

You reshape the area, changing its elevation or creating and eliminating holes, walls, and pillars. The only limitation is that the elevation change may not exceed half the area�s horizontal dimensions. For example, affecting a 40-by-40 area allows you to include 20 foot high pillars, holes 20 feet deep, and changes in terrain elevation of 20 feet or less. Changes that result in unstable terrain are subject to collapse.

Changes take 10 minutes to complete, after which you can choose another area to affect. Due to the slow speed of transformation, it is nearly impossible for creatures to be hurt or captured by the spell.

This spell has no effect on stone, objects crafted from stone, or plants, though these objects will shift based on changes in the area.

**Rare: Holey Move Earth.** The spell�s duration is instantaneous and it no longer requires your concentration. You affect up to 4 areas but only make caverns or

holes (determined at the time of casting), each of which must be 20-foot cubes or smaller.

## Nondetection

*3rd-level (abjuration; arcane, negation, obscurement, scrying, utility)*

**Classes:** Bard, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** Creature, place or object

**Components:** V, S, M (25 gold worth of diamond dust, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** 8 hours

The target is hidden from divination magic and cannot be perceived by magical scrying sensors. When used on a place or object, the spell only works if the target is no larger than 10 feet in any given dimension.

## Passwall

*5th-level (transmutation; arcane, terrain, utility)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** Plaster, stone, or wooden surface **Components:** V, S, M (sesame seeds) **Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, you create a passage extending into the target surface. When creating the passage you define its dimensions, as long as they do not exceed 5 feet in width, 8 feet in height, or 20 feet in depth. The appearance of the passage has no effect on the stability of the surrounding environment.

Any creatures or objects within the passage when the spell ends are expelled without harm into unoccupied spaces near where the spell was cast.

**Rare: Trapped Passwall.** Within a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, the passage left by this spell (which can be as minimal as an inch depression) becomes trapped.

Choose one of the following.

*Slippy.* One side of the passage is covered in slippery soap. When a creature enters the passage�s area or first moves through the area on a turn it must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

*Sticky.* Goo covers one side of the passage, making it difficult terrain.

*Subtle.* An illusion covers the passage making it appear as if nothing has happened to the target surface. The illusion does not hold up to physical inspection. To see through your illusion without physical inspection, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

## Pass Without Trace

*2nd-level (abjuration; nature, obscurement, utility)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Area:** 30-foot radius

**Components:** V, S, M (ashes of mistletoe and spruce)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

You and allies within the area gain advantage and an expertise die on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Creatures in the area leave behind no evidence of their passage.

## Pestilence

*Cantrip (conjuration; nature, summoning)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Area:** 10-foot sphere **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

**Saving Throws:** Constitution negates

A swarm of insects fills the area. Creatures that begin their turn within the spell�s area or that enter the area for the first time on their turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage. The

pests also ravage any unattended organic material within their radius, such as plant, wood, or fabric.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** This spell�s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 10th level (3d4), and 15th level (4d4).

## Phantasmal Killer

*4th-level (illusion; arcane, fear, psychic)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 Feet) **Target:** One creature **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom (special)

You create an illusion that invokes the target�s deepest fears. Only the target can see this illusion. When the spell is cast and at the end of each of its turns, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw or takes 4d10 psychic damage and becomes frightened. The spell ends early when the target succeeds on its saving throw. A target that succeeds on its initial saving throw takes half damage.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

***Rare: Creeping Phantasmal Killer.*** When a target succeeds on its saving throw you may choose a new target for the spell.

That target must make its own saving throw, and on a failure the spell continues without the expenditure of an additional spell slot, using the same duration.

***Rare: Draining Phantasmal Killer.*** When a target is damaged by this spell, you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

## Phantasmal Talons

*1st-level (enchantment; psychic, unarmed)*

**Classes:** Bard, warlock **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

Invisible talons of pure will sprout from your fingers. The talons do not interact with physical matter, but rip viciously at the psyche of any creature struck by them. For the duration, your unarmed strikes gain the finesse property and deal psychic damage. In addition, if your unarmed strike normally deals less than 1d4 damage, it instead deals 1d4 damage.

## Phantom Steed

*3rd-level (illusion; arcane, movement, summoning, utility)*

**Classes:** Wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 minute (ritual) **Range:** Short (30 feet) **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You create an illusory Large creature with an appearance determined by you that comes into being with all the necessary equipment needed to use it as a mount.

This equipment vanishes when more than 10 feet away from the creature.

You or any creature you allow may ride the steed, which uses the statistics for a riding horse but has a Speed of 100 feet and travels at 10 miles per hour at a steady pace (13 miles per hour at a fast pace).

The steed vanishes if it takes damage (disappearing instantly) or you use an action to dismiss it (fading away, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount).

**Rare: Carting Phantom Steed.** Instead of conjuring a mount, you conjure a Large vehicle such as a boat, wagon, or cart.

You decide on its appearance. If the vehicle normally requires horses,

quasi-real beasts with an appearance of your choosing are conjured along with it. The vehicle can transport up to 6 Medium creatures.

**Rare: Stalwart Phantom Steed.** If the steed takes damage and disappears, you can use an action to resummon it as long as you are not in combat and the original duration has not passed. The steed

follows all other restrictions of the original spell.

## Planar Ally

*6th-level (conjuration; divine, planar, summoning)*

**Classes:** Cleric, warlock **Casting Time:** 10 minutes **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

A supernatural entity or your choice answers your call for assistance. The entity sends forth a servant to aid you in your endeavors. If you have a specific servant in mind you may speak its name during the casting, but ultimately who is sent to answer your call is the entity�s decision.

The creature that appears (a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend), is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way other than how its nature and personality direct it. Any request made of the creature, simple or complex, requires an equal amount of payment which you must bargain with the creature to ascertain. The creature can request either items, sacrifices, or services in exchange for its assistance. A creature that you cannot communicate with cannot be bargained with.

A task that can be completed in minutes is worth 100 gold per minute, a task that requires hours is worth 1,000 gold per hour, and a task requiring days is worth 10,000 gold per day (the creature can only accept tasks contained within a 10 day timeframe). A creature can often be persuaded to lower or raise prices depending on how a task aligns with its personality and the goals of its master�some require no payment at all if the task is deemed worthy. Additionally, a task that poses little or no risk only requires half the usual amount of payment, and an extremely dangerous task might call for double the usual payment. Still, only extreme circumstances will cause a creature summoned this way to accept tasks with a near certain result of death.

A creature returns to its place of origin when a task is completed or if you fail to negotiate an agreeable task and payment. Should a creature join your party, it counts as a member of the group and receives a full portion of any experience gained.

***Rare: Forbidden Planar Ally.*** The spell allows the summoning of an aberration.

**Rare: Cruel Planar Ally.** The creature summoned by this spell is always a fiend linked to you. The bargaining costs for all requests made with the fiend are halved, but in exchange the fiend uses the link to gain advantage on saving throws and checks made to avoid being banished or bound, it has resistance to all damage, and each time the fiend takes damage you take an equal amount of damage.

Damage inflicted by this spell cannot kill you.

## Planar Binding

*5th-level (abjuration; arcane, compulsion, divine, nature, planar, utility)*

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, druid, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Target:** One celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend

**Components:** V, S, M (jewel worth at least 1,000 gold, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** 24 hours

**Saving Throw:** Charisma negates

The target must remain within range for the entire casting of the spell (usually by means of a *magic circle* spell). Until the spell ends, you force the target to serve you. If the target was summoned through some other means, like a spell, the duration of the original spell is extended to match this spell�s duration.

Once it is bound to you the target serves as best it can and follows your orders, but only to the letter of the instruction. A hostile or malevolent target actively seeks to take any advantage of errant phrasing to suit its nature. When a target completes a task you�ve assigned to it, if you are on the same plane of existence the target travels back to

you to report it has done so. Otherwise, it returns to where it was bound and remains there until the spell ends.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 6th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 10 days. When using a 7th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 30 days. When using an 8th-level spell slot, its duration increases to 180 days. When using a

9th-level spell slot, its duration increases to a year and a day.

**Rare: Star Sign Planar Binding.** The spell can also target an aberration.

## Plane Shift

*7th-level (conjuration; arcane, divine, nature, planar, teleportation, utility)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One creature, or you and up to 8 willing creatures linking hands in a circle

**Components:** V, S, M (metal rod attuned to a particular plane of existence worth 250 gold)

**Duration:** Instantaneous or Concentration (1 minute)

Willing targets are transported to a plane of existence that you choose. If the destination is generally described, targets arrive near that destination in a location chosen by the Narrator. If you know the correct sequence of an existing teleportation circle (see *teleportation circle*), you can choose it as the destination (when the designated circle is too small for all targets to fit, any additional targets are shunted to the closest unoccupied spaces).

Alternatively this spell can be used offensively to banish an unwilling target. You make a melee spell attack and on a hit the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a random location on a plane of existence that you choose. Once the target is transported, you must spend 1 minute concentrating on this spell or the target returns to the last space it

occupied (otherwise it must find its own way back).

## Plant Growth

*3rd-level (transmutation; nature, plants, terrain)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid

**Casting Time:** 1 action (rapid) or 8 hours (enlarged)

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Area:** 100-foot radius (rapid) or half-mile radius (enlarged)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel vitality into vegetation to achieve one of the following effects, chosen when casting the spell.

**Enlarged:** Plants in the area are greatly enriched. Any harvests of the affected plants provide twice as much food as normal.

**Rapid:** All nonmagical plants in the area surge with the power of life. A creature that moves through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size from being affected.

**Rare: Overwhelming Plant Growth.** This spell doesn�t require the presence of

pre-existing vegetation to take effect, but must use the Rapid option, and plants that appear only last for a day before fading away.

## Poison Skin

*3rd-level (abjuration; nature, poison, protection)*

**Classes:** Druid, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch **Target:** One creature

**Components:** V, S, M (handful of frog spawn)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) The target becomes poisonous to the touch. Until the spell ends, whenever a

creature within 5 feet of the target damages

the target with a melee weapon attack, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned and takes 1d6 ongoing poison damage. A poisoned creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The target of the spell also becomes bright and multicolored like a poisonous dart frog, giving it disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The target�s skin is also covered in mucus, giving it advantage on saving throws and checks made to resist being grappled or restrained. In addition, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Polymorph

*4th-level (transmutation; affliction, arcane, beasts, nature, shapechanging, transformation)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Target:** One creature with at least 1 hit point that is not a shapechanger

**Components:** V, S, M (cocoon) **Duration:** Concentration (1 hour) **Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates

The target�s body is transformed into a beast with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the target doesn�t have a Challenge Rating, use its level.

Until the spell ends or it is dropped to 0 hit points, the target�s game statistics (including its hit points and mental ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can�t speak or cast spells. The target�s gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target�s form has no effect until it leaves the form.

When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell�s effects on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit

points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

*9th-level (enchantment; arcane, attack)* **Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** One creature **Components:** V **Duration:** Instantaneous

With but a word you snuff out the target�s life and it immediately dies. If you cast this on a creature with more than 100 hit points, it instead takes 50 damage.

**Rare: Sacrificial Power Word Kill.** When a target dies from the effects of this spell, you may use its life force to save yourself. For the next 8 hours, the first time you would drop to 0 hit points or be outright killed, you instead drop to 1 hit point. Once this effect is used, the life force is expended and the effect ends.

## Power Word Stun

**Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** One creature **Components:** V **Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a powerful word that stuns a target with 150 hit points or less. At the end of the target�s turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw to end the effect. If the target has more than 150 hit points, it is instead rattled until the end of its next turn.

**Rare: Maiming Power Word Stun.** When a target succeeds on its saving throw, its movement is halved and it is either blinded or deafened (your choice) until the end of its next turn.

You may cast this spell multiple times, though only three effects may be active at a

## Prismatic Spray

*7th-level (evocation; arcane, prismatic)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Area:** 60-foot cone **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Dexterity halves damage or negates a condition

**2�***Orange:* The target takes 10d6 acid damage.

**3�***Yellow:* The target takes 10d6 lightning damage.

**4�***Green:* The target takes 10d6 poison damage.

**5�***Blue:* The target takes 10d6 cold damage.

**6�***Indigo:* The target is restrained and at the end of each of its turns it makes a Constitution saving throw. Once it accumulates two failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it accumulates two successful saves the effect ends.

**7�***Violet:* The target is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the target is banished to another random plane and is no longer blind. If it originated from another plane it returns there, while other creatures are generally cast into the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane.

**8�***Special:* The target is hit by two rays. Roll a d8 twice to determine which rays, rerolling any 8s.

## Prismatic Wall

*9th-level (abjuration; arcane, prismatic, protection)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Area:** 15-foot radius sphere, or 90-foot long wall that is 30 feet high and 1 inch thick

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a nontransparent barrier of prismatic energy that sheds bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you choose at the time of casting are immune to the barrier�s effects and may pass through it at will.

The barrier can be created as either a vertical wall or a sphere. If the wall intersects a space occupied by a creature the spell fails, you lose your action, and the spell slot is wasted.

When a creature that can see the barrier moves within 20 feet of the area or starts its turn within 20 feet of the area, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.

The wall has 7 layers, each layer of a different color in order from red to violet. Once a layer is destroyed, it is gone for the duration of the spell. To pass or reach through the barrier a creature does so one layer at a time and must make a Dexterity saving throw for each layer or be subjected to that layer�s effects. On a successful save, any damage taken from a layer is reduced by half.

A *rod of cancellation* can destroy a *prismatic wall*, but an *antimagic field* has no effect.

*Red:* The creature takes 10d6 fire damage. While active, nonmagical ranged attacks can�t penetrate the barrier. The layer is destroyed by 25 cold damage.

*Orange:* The creature takes 10d6 acid damage. While active, magical ranged

attacks can�t penetrate the barrier. The layer is destroyed by strong winds.

*Yellow:* The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage. This layer is destroyed by 60 force damage.

*Green:* The creature takes 10d6 poison damage. A *passwall* spell, or any spell of equal or greater level which can create a portal on a solid surface, destroys the layer.

*Blue:* The creature takes 10d6 cold damage. This layer is destroyed by 25 fire damage.

*Indigo:* The creature is restrained and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Once it accumulates three failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it accumulates three successful saves the effect ends. This layer can be destroyed by bright light, such as that created by the *daylight* spell or a spell of equal or greater level.

*Violet:* The creature is blinded. At the start of your next turn, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. On a failed save, the creature is banished to another random plane and is no longer blind. If it originated from another plane it returns there, while other creatures are generally cast into the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane. This layer can be destroyed by *dispel magic* or a similar spell of equal or greater level capable of ending spells or magical effects.

You create a flame in your hand which lasts until the spell ends and does no harm to you or your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

The spell ends when you dismiss it, cast it again, or attack with the flame. As part of casting the spell or as an action on a following turn, you can fling the flame at a creature within 30 feet, making a ranged spell attack that deals 1d8 fire damage.

This spell�s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Rare: Charged Produce Flame.** You conjure a ball of lightning in your hand instead of flame. The ball of lightning

You must describe both the condition and the details of the performance upon casting. The trigger must be based on something that can be seen or heard.

Once the illusion triggers, it runs its performance for up to 5 minutes before it disappears and goes dormant for 10 minutes. The illusion is undetectable until then and only reactivates when the condition is triggered and after the dormant period has passed.

A creature can use an action to attempt an Investigation check against your spell save DC to reveal the spell�s illusory nature.

Physical interactions reveal the illusion for what it is as things can pass through it with ease. A creature aware of the illusion perceives the image as transparent and the sounds it generates hollow.

*Spawning Pits.* The ground opens to create up to 6 pits filled with poisonous bile. Each pit fills a 10-foot cube that drops beneath the ground. When this spell is cast, any creature whose space is on a pit may make a Dexterity saving throw, moving to an unoccupied space next to the pit on a success. A creature that enters a pit or starts its turn there takes 15d6 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage immediately dies and rises as a lemure at the start of its next turn. Lemures created this way obey your verbal commands, but they disappear when the spell ends or if they leave the area for any reason.

*Unhallowed Spires.* Up to four spires of black ice rise from the ground in unoccupied 10-foot squares within the area. Each spire can be up to 66 feet tall and is immune to all damage and magical effects.

Once inside, the rope can be pulled into the extradimensional space.

No spells or attacks can cross into or out of the extradimensional space. Creatures inside the extradimensional space can see out of a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on its entrance. Creatures outside the space can spot the entrance with a Perception check against your spell save DC. If they can reach it, creatures can pass in and out of the space.

When the spell ends, anything inside the extradimensional space falls to the ground.

This spell�s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates (24 hours)

You can observe a specific creature that you choose. The difficulty of the saving throw for this spell is modified by your knowledge of the target and whether you possess a physical item with a connection to the target.

On a failed save, you can see and hear the target through an invisible sensor that appears within 10 feet of it and moves with the target. Any creature who can see invisibility or rolls a critical success on its saving throw perceives the sensor as a

fist-sized glowing orb hovering in the air.

Creatures cannot see or hear you through the sensor.

If you choose to target a location, the sensor appears at that location and is immobile.

**Area:** 15-foot cone **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Intelligence halves and negates deafened

You briefly go into a magical trance and whisper an alien equation which you never fully remember once the spell is complete. Each creature in the area takes 3d4 psychic damage and is deafened for 1 round.

Creatures who are unable to hear the equation, are immune to psychic damage, or who have an Intelligence score lower than 4 are immune to this spell.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** Creatures are deafened for 1 additional round for each slot level above 1st.

## Secret Chest

*4th-level (conjuration; arcane, planar, utility)*

While the chest is in the Ethereal Plane, you can recall it to you at any point by using an action to touch the Tiny replica. The chest reappears in an unoccupied space on a surface within 5 feet of you. You can use an action at any time to return the chest to the Ethereal Plane so long as you are touching both the chest and its Tiny replica. This effect ends if you cast the spell again on a different chest, if the replica is destroyed, or if you use an action to end the spell. After 60 days without being recalled, there is a cumulative 5% chance per day that the spell effect will end. If for whatever reason the spell ends while the chest is still in the Ethereal Plane, the chest and all of its contents are lost.

Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 piercing damage. Depending on the material component used, a seed bomb also causes one of the following additional effects:

**Pinecone.** Seed shrapnel explodes outward. A creature in the area of the exploding seed bomb must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it be blinded until the end of its next turn.

**Sunflower.** Seeds enlarge into a blanket of pointy needles. The area affected by the exploding seed bomb becomes difficult terrain for the next minute.

**Tumbleweed.** The weeds unravel to latch around creatures. A creature in the area of the exploding seed bomb must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become grappled until the end of its next turn.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Seeming

*5th-level (illusion; arcane, obscurement, utility)*

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** Any number of creatures you can see

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

Until the spell ends or you use an action to dispel it, you can change the appearance of the targets. The spell can change the appearance of their bodies and possessions. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw to avoid being affected by the spell.

You can alter the appearance of the target as you see fit, including but not limited to: its heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex and any other distinguishing features. You cannot disguise the target as a creature of a different size category, and its limb structure remains the same.

The disguise does not hold up to touch. To see through your disguise without such an interaction, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

## Sending

*3rd-level (evocation; arcane, communication, divine)*

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Unlimited

**Target:** One creature you are familiar with

**Components:** V, S, M (piece of copper wire)

**Duration:** 1 round

You send a message of 25 words or less to the target. It recognizes you as the sender and can reply immediately in kind. The message travels across any distance and into other planes of existence. If the target is on a different plane of existence than you, there is a 5% chance it doesn�t receive your message. A target with an Intelligence score of at least 1 understands your message as you intend it (whether you share a language or not).

## Sequester

*7th-level (transmutation; arcane, obscurement, utility)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One willing creature or object

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered precious gemstones worth at least 5,000 gold, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You magically hide away a willing creature or object. The target becomes invisible, and it cannot be traced or detected by divination or scrying sensors. If the target is a living creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation and stops aging.

The spell ends when the target takes damage or a condition you set occurs. The condition must pertain to creatures or objects within 1 mile of the target or be visible within that distance.

## Shapechange

*9th-level (transmutation; arcane, nature, shapechanging)*

**Classes:** Druid, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (helm, crown, or circlet worth at least 1,500 gold placed on your head before the transformation)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour) You take the form of a creature of a

Challenge Rating equal to or lower than your level. The creature cannot be an undead or a construct, and it must be a creature you have seen. You change into the average version of that creature, and do not gain any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.

Until the spell ends or you are dropped to 0 hit points, your statistics (except your Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores) are replaced by those of the chosen creature. You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies as well as gaining the creature�s, keeping the higher of the two if you share one in common. You keep all of your features, skills, and traits gained from your class, heritage, culture, background, or other sources, and can use them as long as the creature is physically able to do so. You do not keep any special senses, such as darkvision. You can only speak if the creature is typically capable of speech. You cannot use legendary actions or lair actions. Your gear melds into the new form.

Equipment that merges with your form has no effect until you leave the form.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If the spell�s effect on you ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form and knocks you

unconscious if the damage reduces you to 0 hit points.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action to change into another form of your choice. The new form follows all the rules as the previous form, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points than your previous form, you keep the previous form�s hit points.

**Rare: Malleable Form.** When you cast this spell, you can choose to add an additional physical trait or change one existing trait of the form you adopt. For example, you can add the wings of a roc to the form of a rhinoceros (gaining a fly speed of 120 feet), change the color of fur or scales, add a poisonous barb to the end of a tail, and so on.

## Shattering Barrage

*2nd-level (evocation; air, terrain)*

You create three orbs of jagged broken glass and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each orb. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage and the shards of broken glass remain suspended in midair, filling the area they occupy (or 5 feet of the space they occupy if the creature is Large-sized or larger) with shards of suspended broken glass. Whenever a creature enters an area of broken glass for the first time or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4 slashing damage.

The shards of broken glass dissolve into harmless wisps of sand and blow away after 1 minute.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** You create one additional orb for each slot level above 2nd.

**Rare: Persistent Shattering Barrage.** The shards of broken glass do not dissolve harmlessly and instead fall, turning the area they occupy into difficult terrain.

## Shield of Faith

*1st-level (abjuration; divine, protection)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** One creature

**Components:** V, S, M (scrap of holy writings)

**Rare: Radiant Shield.** When a creature makes a melee attack against the target, it takes 1d6 radiant damage as the shield sparks and flares with holy power.

## Shillelagh

*Cantrip (transmutation; nature, transformation, weaponry)*

**Classes:** Druid

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Club or quarterstaff you are holding

**Components:** V, S, M (club or quarterstaff)

**Duration:** 1 minute

Until the spell ends, the target becomes a magical weapon (if it wasn�t already), its damage becomes 1d8, and you can use

your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for melee attack and damage rolls made using it. The spell ends if you cast it again or let go of the target.

## Shocking Grasp

*Cantrip (evocation; affliction, arcane, attack, lightning)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One creature **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

Electricity arcs from your fingertips to shock the target. Make a melee spell attack (with advantage if the target is wearing metal armor). On a hit, you deal 1d8 lightning damage, and the target can�t take reactions until the start of its next turn as the electricity courses through its body.

This spell�s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

## Silence

*2nd-level (illusion; arcane, divine, negation, senses)*

**Classes:** Bard, cleric

**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)

**Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** 20-foot radius sphere **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) Until the spell ends, a bubble of silence envelops the area, and no sound can travel in or out of it. While in the area a creature is deafened and immune to thunder damage. Casting a spell that requires a vocalized component is impossible while within the area.

## Silent Image

**Target:** 15-foot cube

**Components:** V, S, M (bit of wool)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

You create an illusory visual image of a creature, object, or other visible effect within the area. The illusion cannot produce sound or smell, and items and other creatures pass through it.

As an action, you can move the image to any point within range. The image�s movement can be natural and lifelike.

A creature that touches the image recognizes it as an illusion. A creature can also spend an action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to determine if the image is an illusion. On a success, it is able to see through the image.

## Simulacrum

*7th-level (illusion; arcane, transformation)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 12 hours **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time

**Components:** V, S, M (a snow or ice copy of the target, a piece of the target�s body placed inside the snow or ice, and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gold spread over the duplicate, all consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You sculpt an illusory duplicate of the target from ice and snow. The duplicate looks exactly like the target and uses all the statistics of the original, though it is formed

without any gear, and has only half of the target�s hit point maximum. The duplicate is a creature and can take actions. If the target is able to cast spells, the duplicate cannot cast spells of 7th-level or higher.

The duplicate is friendly to you and your allies. It follows your orders, and moves and acts on your turn in combat. It is a static creature and it does not learn, age, or grow, so it never increases in levels and cannot regain any spent spell slots.

When the simulacrum is damaged you can repair it in an alchemy lab using components worth 100 gold per hit point it regains. When reduced to 0 hit points the simulacrum crumbles into snow and melts away immediately. The simulacrum is also destroyed if you cast this spell again.

## Sleep

**Area:** 20-foot radius

**Components:** V, S, M (pinch of sand)

**Duration:** 1 minute

You put creatures into a deep enchanted sleep. Starting with the target with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures), targets within the area fall unconscious in ascending order according to their hit points. Slumbering creatures stay asleep until the spell ends, they take damage, or someone uses an action to physically wake them.

As each target falls asleep, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the next target. A target�s hit points must be equal to or less than the total remaining for the spell to have any effect.

If the spell puts no creatures to sleep, the creature in the area with the lowest hit point total is rattled until the beginning of its next turn.

Constructs and undead are not affected by this spell.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell affects an additional 2d10 hit points worth of creatures for each slot level above 1st.

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Area:** 40-foot radius cylinder that is 20 feet high

**Components:** V, S, M (few drops of melted snow)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You conjure a storm of freezing rain and sleet in the area. The ground in the area is covered with slippery ice that makes it difficult terrain, exposed flames in the area are extinguished, and the area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on a turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration.

## Slow

*3rd-level (transmutation; arcane, movement,*

*negation, time)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Target:** Up to six creatures of your choice

**Area:** 40-foot cube

**Components:** V, S, M (drop of molasses) **Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) **Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates

A target that fails its saving throw is slowed. On a successful saving throw, a target is instead rattled until the end of its next turn. At the end of each of its turns, a slowed target repeats the saving throw to end the spell�s effect on it.

If a slowed target casts a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the target doesn�t finish casting the spell until its next turn. The target must use its action on that turn to complete the spell or the spell fails.

## Soulwrought Fists

*2nd-level (transmutation; enhancement, transformation, unarmed, weaponry)*

**Classes:** Cleric, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch **Target:** One creature

**Components:** V, S, M (handful of iron filings)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) **Saving Throw:** Constitution negates The target�s hands harden with inner power, turning dexterous fingers into

magical iron cudgels. Until the spell ends, the target drops anything it is holding and cannot use its hands to grasp objects or perform complex tasks. A target can still cast any spell that does not specifically require its hands. When making unarmed strikes, the target can use its spellcasting ability or Dexterity (its choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In addition, the target�s unarmed strikes deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and count as magical for the

purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

## Spare the Dying

*Cantrip (necromancy; divine, healing)*

**Classes:** Cleric **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One living creature with 0 hit points

**Components:** V, S

A jolt of healing energy flows through the target and it becomes stable.

**Rare: Costly Spare the Dying.** For the next 3 rounds, at the start of its turn the target rolls 1d20, regaining 1 hit point on a result of 20. Whether or not it regains any hit points, for the next 24 hours the target is rattled.

## Speak with Animals

*1st-level (divination; beasts, communication, nature, utility)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid

**Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual)

**Range:** Self **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 10 minutes

You call upon the secret lore of beasts and gain the ability to speak with them. Beasts have a different perspective of the world, and their knowledge and awareness is filtered through that perspective. Typically, beasts are aware of locations and creatures near the area they live in, and events that transpired near them recently. At the Narrator�s discretion, you might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you.

**Rare: Insightful Speak with Animals.** So long as your spell save DC is higher than the passive Insight score of a beast you are conversing with, you can use an action to view the memories of an event the beast is describing.

## Speak with Dead

*3rd-level (necromancy; communication, divine,*

*knowledge, utility)* **Classes:** Bard, cleric **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One corpse **Components:** V, S, M ( incense) **Duration:** 10 minutes

You call forth the target�s memories, animating it enough to answer 5 questions. The corpse�s knowledge is limited: it knows only what it knew in life and cannot learn new information or speak about anything that has occurred since its death. It speaks only in the languages it knew, and doesn�t need to give a truthful answer if it has reason not to. Answers might be brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

This spell does not return a departed soul, nor does it have any effect on an undead corpse, or one without a mouth.

## Speak with Plants

*3rd-level (transmutation; communication, nature, plants, utility)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Target:** Plants in a 30-foot radius

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Your voice takes on a magical timbre, awakening the targets to limited sentience.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate with you and follow simple commands, telling you about recent events including creatures that have passed, weather, and nearby locations.

The targets have a limited mobility: they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks freely. This allows them to turn ordinary terrain into difficult terrain, or make difficult terrain caused by vegetation into ordinary terrain for the duration as vines and branches move at your request. This spell can also release a creature restrained by an *entangle* spell.

At the Narrator�s discretion the targets may be able to perform other tasks, though each must remain rooted in place. If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it but it is not compelled to follow your requests.

**Rare: Insightful Speak with Plants.** So long as your spell save DC is higher than the passive Insight score of a plant you are conversing with, you can use an action to view the memories of an event the plant is describing.

## Spider Climb

*2nd-level (transmutation; arcane, movement, utility)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Rare: Sure-Footed Spider Climb.** The target automatically succeeds on ability checks and saving throws made to keep its balance.

## Spike Growth

*2nd-level (transmutation; nature, terrain)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** 20-foot radius

**Components:** V, S, M (a thorned branch)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) You cause sharp spikes and thorns to sprout in the area, making it difficult terrain.

When a creature enters or moves within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

Your magic causes the ground to look natural. A creature that can�t see the area when the spell is cast can spot the hazardous terrain just before entering it by making a Perception check against your spell save DC.

**Rare: Sneaky Spike Growth.** The spikes and thorns created by this spell are invisible and a creature cannot perceive them until it has been damaged by this spell.

## Spirit Guardians

*3rd-level (conjuration; divine, necrotic, radiant)*

**Classes:** Cleric **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self

**Area:** 10-foot radius

**Components:** V, S, M (holy symbol) **Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) **Saving Throw:** Wisdom halves damage

You call down spirits of divine fury, filling the area with flitting spectral forms. You choose the form taken by the spirits.

Creatures of your choice halve their Speed while in the area. When an affected creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 3d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice).

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Spiritual Weapon

*2nd-level (evocation; attack, divine, force)*

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a levitating, incandescent weapon with an appearance of your choosing and use it to attack your enemies. On the round you cast it, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon that deals force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and make another attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. **Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

**Rare: Fell Spiritual Weapon.** The weapon deals necrotic damage instead of force damage, and when it scores a critical hit its target is rattled until the end of your next turn.

## Sporesight

*7th-level (evocation; nature, obscurement, senses)*

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Area:** 50-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, S, M (toadstool) **Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) You throw a mushroom at a point within range and detonate it, creating a cloud of spores that fills the area. The cloud of

spores travels around corners, and the area is considered lightly obscured for everyone except you. Creatures and objects within the area are covered in spores.

Until the spell ends, you know the exact location of all affected objects and creatures. Any attack roll you make against an affected creature or object has advantage, and the affected creatures and objects can�t benefit from being invisible.

**Rare: Poisonous Sporesight.** Choose a number of creatures in the area equal to your proficiency bonus. Any other creature that starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 poison damage on a failed save.

## Stinking Cloud

*3rd-level (conjuration; arcane, poison)* **Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Area:** 20-foot radius sphere

**Components:** V, S, M (rotten egg or dried fish scale)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You create a roiling, noxious cloud that hinders creatures and leaves them retching.

The cloud spreads around corners and lingers in the air until the spell ends.

The area is heavily obscured. A creature in the area at the start of its turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or use its action to retch and reel. Creatures that don�t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on the save.

The cloud is dispersed by moderate winds (10 miles per hour) after 4 rounds, and by strong winds (20 miles per hour) after 1 round.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The spell�s area increases by 5 feet for every 2 slot levels above 3rd.

**Rare: Dyed Stinking Cloud.** Choose a color for the cloud when you cast this spell. When a creature makes a saving throw against this spell it is dyed that color until it uses an action to wipe away the residue.

**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay shaped as part of the spell)

You reshape the target into any form you choose. For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or chest, make a small passage through a walls less than 5 feet thick, seal a stone door shut, or create a hiding place. The target can have up to two hinges and a latch, but more complex mechanics aren�t possible.

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** One willing creature

**Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gold, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

Until the spell ends, the target�s skin becomes as hard as stone and the target gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 7th-level spell slot, the target gains

resistance to magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

## Storm Kick

*5th-level (transmutation; lightning, movement, thunder, unarmed)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Target:** One creature **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

You must be able to move in order to cast this spell. You leap into the air and flash across the battlefield, arriving feet-first with the force of a thunderbolt. As part of casting this spell, make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within range. If you hit, you instantly flash to an open space of your choosing adjacent to the target, dealing bludgeoning damage equal

to 1d6 + your spellcasting modifier plus 3d8 thunder damage and 6d8 lightning damage. If your unarmed strike normally uses a larger die, use that instead of a d6. If you miss, you may still choose to teleport next to the target.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a

6th-level spell slot or higher, if you are able to make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, you may make an additional melee weapon attack against the target. When using a 7th-level spell slot, you may choose an additional target within 30 feet of the target for each spell slot level above 6th, forcing each additional target to make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d8 lightning damage.

## Storm of Vengeance

*9th-level (conjuration; acid, cold, lightning, nature, storm, thunder, weather)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Special (sight)

**Target:** 360-foot radius area that is up to 5,000 feet in the air

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You conjure a storm cloud that covers the target area. As it forms, lightning and thunder mix with howling winds, and each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 thunder damage and become deafened for 5 minutes.

Until the spell ends, at the start of your turn the cloud produces additional effects:

**Round 2.** Acid rain falls throughout the area dealing 1d6 acid damage to each creature and object beneath the cloud.

**Round 3.** Lightning bolts strike up to 6 creatures or objects of your choosing that are beneath the cloud (no more than one

bolt per creature or object). A creature struck by this lightning makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.

**Round 4.** Heavy hail falls throughout the area dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature beneath the cloud.

**Round 5�10.** Freezing rain and roiling winds turn the area beneath the cloud into difficult terrain that is heavily obscured. Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss while a creature or its target are beneath the cloud. When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn beneath the cloud or enters into the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration. Gusts of strong winds between 20�50 miles per hour automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar effects (whether mundane or magical). Finally, each creature beneath the cloud takes 1d6 cold damage.

Any damage done to the target by you or one of your allies ends the spell for that creature.

concentration, up to 24 hours. When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 7 days.

When using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 year. When using a 9th-level spell slot, the suggestion lasts until it is dispelled. Any use of a 5th-level or higher spell slot grants a duration that doesn�t require concentration.

Each creature in the area takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded by this spell repeats its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a successful save. This spell dispels any magical darkness in its area. This light is sunlight.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a

9th-level spell slot the damage increases by 2d6.

the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends. Finding the Tiny glyph requires an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

Describe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the spell, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph. The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it. You can specify certain creatures which don�t trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.

When triggered, the glyph sheds dim light in a 60-foot radius for 10 minutes, after which the spell ends. Each creature within the sphere�s area is targeted by the glyph, as are creatures that enter the sphere for the first time on a turn.

**Area:** 20-foot radius

**Components:** V, S, M (whole onion)

**Duration:** Concentration (3 rounds)

You play a song that fills creatures with magical sorrow. Each creature in the area makes a Charisma saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4 psychic damage, it spends its action that turn crying, and it can�t take reactions until the start of its next turn. Creatures that are immune to the charmed condition automatically succeed on this saving throw.

If a creature other than you hears the entire song (remaining within the spell�s area from the casting through the duration) it is so wracked with sadness that it is stunned for 1d4 rounds.

You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.

You move the target with the power of your mind. Until the spell ends you can use an action on subsequent turns to pick a new target or continue to affect the same target. Depending on whether you target a creature or an object, the spell has the following effects:

**Creature:** The target makes a Strength check against your spell save DC or it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction and restrained (even in mid-air) until the end of your next turn. You cannot move a target beyond the range of the spell.

**Object:** You move the target 30 feet in any direction. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If the target fails, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of the spell.

You can use *telekinesis* to finely manipulate objects as though you were

using them yourself�you can open doors and unscrew lids, dip a quill in ink and make it write, and so on.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using an 8th-level spell slot, this spell does not require your concentration.

**Components:** V, S, M (two matching cards from different decks)

**Target:** You and up to 8 willing creatures within 10 feet of you, or a single unattended object that fits entirely inside a 10-foot cube

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport the targets instantly across vast distances. When you cast this spell, choose a destination. You must know the location you�re teleporting to, and it must be on the same plane of existence.

Teleportation is difficult magic and you may arrive off-target or somewhere else entirely depending on how familiar you are with the location you�re teleporting to. When you teleport, the Narrator rolls 1d100 and consults Table: Teleport Familiarity.

Familiarity is determined as follows:

**Permanent Circle:** A permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know (see *teleportation circle*).

**Associated Object:** You have an object taken from the target location within the last 6 months.

**Very Familiar:** A place you have frequented, carefully studied, or can see at the time you cast the spell.

**Seen Casually:** A place you have seen more than once but don�t know well.

**Viewed Once:** A place you have seen once, either in person or via magic.

**Description:** A place you only know from someone else�s description (whether spoken, written, or even marked on a map).

**False Destination:** A place that doesn�t actually exist.

Your arrival is determined as follows:

**On Target:** You and your targets arrive exactly where you mean to.

**Off Target:** You and your targets arrive some distance away from the target in a random direction. The further you travel, the further away you are likely to arrive. You arrive off target by a number of miles equal to 1d10 � 1d10 percent of the total distance of your trip. If you tried to travel 1,000 miles and roll a 2 and 4 on the d10s, you land 6 percent off target and arrive 60 miles away from your intended destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 to randomly determine the direction: 1�north, 2�northeast, 3�east, 4�southeast, 5�south, 6�southwest, 7�west, 8�northwest.

**Similar Location:** You and your targets arrive in a different location that somehow resembles the target area. If you tried to teleport to your favorite inn, you might end up at a different inn, or in a room with much of the same decor.

Typically you appear at the closest similar location, but not always.

**Mishap:** The spell�s magic goes awry, and each teleporting creature or object takes 3d10 force damage. The Narrator rerolls on the table to determine where you arrive. When multiple mishaps occur targets take damage each time.

**Duration:** 1 round

You draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground and open within it a shimmering portal to a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere in the world. The portal remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly travels to the destination circle.

Permanent teleportation circles are commonly found within royal palaces, major centers of commerce, and other important

locations. Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in a certain pattern called a sigil sequence.

When you cast *teleportation circle*, you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle you know. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the Narrator. You can learn a new sigil sequence with 1 minute of observation and study.

Casting the spell in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent teleportation circle with its own unique sigil sequence. You do not need to teleport when casting the spell to make a permanent destination.

*Cantrip (transmutation; divine, enhancement)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet) **Area:** Special **Components:** V **Duration:** Up to 1 minute

Unsecured objects completely within the area are also pushed 10 feet away from you. The thunderous boom of the spell is audible out to 300 feet.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

**Rare: Shaking Thunderwave.** A creature that takes 10 or more damage from this spell is knocked prone.

**Components:** V, S, M (piece of thatched roof woven into a dome and a sculpture of a protective deity worth 200 gold, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You create an immobile dome of protective force that provides shelter and can be used as a safe haven. The dome is of a color of your choosing, can�t be seen through from the outside, is transparent on the inside, and can fit up to 10 Medium creatures (including you) within.

The dome prevents inclement weather and environmental effects from passing through it, though creatures and objects may pass through freely. Spells and other magical effects can�t cross the dome in either direction, and the dome provides a comfortable dry interior no matter the conditions outside of it. You can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark at any time on your turn.

The spell fails if a Large or larger creature or more than 10 creatures are inside the affected area when you cast the spell. The spell ends when you leave the dome or if more than 10 creatures enter the dome.

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** Large or larger inanimate plant

**Components**: V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

You create a magical pathway between the target and a second plant that you�ve seen or touched before that is on the same plane of existence. Any creature can step into the target and exit from the second plant by using 5 feet of movement.

## Traveler�s Ward

*1st-level (abjuration; protection, sound)* **Classes:** Bard, cleric, herald, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch **Target:** One creature

**Components:** V, S, M (well-polished ball bearing)

**Duration:** 8 hours

Until the spell ends, creatures have disadvantage on Sleight of Hand checks made against the target. If a creature fails a Sleight of Hand check to steal from the target, the ward creates a loud noise and a flash of bright light easily heard and seen by creatures within 100 feet.

## Tree Stride

*5th-level (conjuration; divine, nature, plants, teleportation)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

Until the spell ends, once per round you can use 5 feet of movement to enter a living tree and move to inside another living tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees

must be at least your size. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet. You may step back outside of the original tree or spend 5 more feet of movement to appear within a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, but you must end your turn outside of a tree. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** Target one additional creature within reach for each slot level above 5th.

## True Polymorph

*9th-level (transmutation; arcane, shapechanging, transformation)* **Classes:** Bard, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** One unattended nonmagical object or one creature with at least 1 hit point that is not a shapechanger

**Components**: V, S, M (mercury, gum arabic, smoke)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour)

**Saving Throw**: Wisdom negates

The target is transformed until it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends. You can make the transformation permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration.

**Creature into Creature:** The target�s body is transformed into a creature with a Challenge Rating equal to or less than its own. If the target doesn�t have a Challenge Rating, use its level.

The target�s game statistics (including its hit points and mental ability scores) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature. The target is limited to actions that it is physically capable of doing, and it can�t speak or cast spells, though its personality remains unchanged. If the target is changed into a creature with an alignment trait, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it gains that alignment trait for the duration of the spell. Otherwise, it keeps its own alignment trait.

The target�s gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with a target�s form has no effect until it leaves the form.

When the target reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If the spell�s effects on the target end early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form and knocks it unconscious if the damage reduces it to 0 hit points.

**Object into Creature:** The target is transformed into any kind of creature, as long as the creature�s size isn�t larger than the object�s size and it has a Challenge Rating of 9 or less. The creature is friendly to you and your allies and acts on each of your turns, but only . you dictate its actions and movement.

However, the Narrator resolves the creature�s actions and movement and has its statistics.

If the spell becomes permanent, your control over the creature ends. At this point its attitude towards you is determined by how you treated it previously.

**Creature into Object:** You turn the target and whatever it is wearing and carrying into an object. The target�s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen object and it retains no memory of this time. When the spell ends it reverts to its previous form.

Each creature in an area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in more than one area is affected only once.

You can use a bonus action to mentally command it to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending surfaces and objects, serving a meal, doing laundry, and the like. Once given a command the servant performs the task to completion, then waits for its next command.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes:** Bard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Target:** One creature **Components:** V **Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Wisdom negates

You verbally insult or mock the target so viciously its mind is seared. As long as the target hears you (understanding your words is not required) it takes 1d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell�s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

**Rare: Taunting Vicious Mockery.** Your amazingly effective insults and mockeries also entertain others�even the target�s allies. On a failed saving throw the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls next round, and if it makes an attack it can only target you (it can take other actions, but if the target takes the Attack action or casts a spell that includes a spell attack, that attack must

be against you). Persuasion checks you make against the target have disadvantage, even after the spell�s duration ends.

## Wall of Fire

*4th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, divine, fire, protection)*

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** Special

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorus powder)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long (it does not have to be a straight line; sections of the wall can angle as long as they are contiguous), 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall blocks sight.

When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall (chosen when the spell is cast) deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature also takes that damage when it enters the wall itself for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side deals no damage.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

## Wall of Flesh

**Components:** V, S, M (piece of bone)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

A squirming wall of body parts noisily heaves itself up from the ground at a point

you choose. The wall is 6 inches thick and is made up of a contiguous group of ten

10-foot square sections. The wall can have any shape you desire.

If the wall enters a creature�s space when it appears, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, and on a success it moves up to its Speed to escape. On a failed save, it is swallowed by the wall (as below).

When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn within 10 feet of the wall, tentacles and arms reach out to grab it. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and becomes grappled. If the creature was already grappled by the wall at the start of its turn and fails its saving throw, a mouth opens in the wall and swallows the creature.

A creature swallowed by the wall takes 5d8 ongoing bludgeoning damage and is blinded, deafened, and restrained.

A creature grappled or restrained by the wall can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, a grappled creature frees itself and a restrained creature claws its way out of the wall�s space, exiting to an empty space next to the wall and still grappled.

Cast at Higher Levels. The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above the 6th.

**Rare: Eager Wall of Flesh.** The wall�s reach increases and it can target creatures within 15 feet of it. In addition, when a creature fails its saving throw against the wall by 5 or more the wall swallows the creature.

## Wall of Force

*5th-level (evocation; arcane, force, planar, protection, utility)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** Special

**Components:** V, S, M (powder of crushed clear gemstone)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

You create an invisible wall of force at a point you choose. The wall is a horizontal or vertical barrier, or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten

10-foot square sections. The wall is 1/4 inch thick.

If the wall enters a creature�s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move up to its Speed to escape. Any creature without a special sense like blindsight has disadvantage on this saving throw.

Nothing can physically pass through the wall.It can be destroyed with *dispel magic* cast using a spell slot of at least 5th-level or by being dealt at least 25 force damage in one round by a single attack or from a single effect. It is otherwise immune to damage. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through it.

**Rare: Superior Forcewall.** Creatures pushed to one side of the wall are knocked prone. The wall can be destroyed with *dispel magic* cast using a spell slot of at least 6th-level or by being dealt at least 50 force damage in one round by a single attack or from a single effect.

## Wall of Ice

*6th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, cold, protection)*

**Classes:** Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** Special

**Components:** V, S, M (quartz)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) You create a wall of ice on a solid surface.

You can form it into a hemispherical dome

or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. The wall is 1 foot thick.

If the wall enters a creature�s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of it (your choice). In addition, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

The wall is an object with vulnerability to fire damage, AC 12, and 30 hit points per 10-foot section. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the section occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

**Rare: Glacial Wall.** The wall is not vulnerable to fire damage. Each section has AC 15 and 35 hit points.

## Wall of Stone

*5th-level (evocation; arcane, divine, earth, obscurement, protection, terrain, utility)* **Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Long (120 feet)

**Area:** Special

**Components:** V, S, M (granite cube)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes)

You cause a nonmagical wall of solid stone to appear at a point you choose. The wall is 6 inches thick and is made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. Alternatively, you can create

10-foot-by-20-foot sections that are only 3 inches thick.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can�t occupy the same space as a

creature or object. The wall doesn�t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation but must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If the wall enters a creature�s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice), but when a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), it can use its reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw to move up to its Speed to escape.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenelations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object, and each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and at the Narrator�s discretion might cause connected panels to collapse.

You can make the wall permanent by concentrating on the spell for the full duration.

**Rare: Hardy Wall of Stone.** Each panel has AC 18 and 40 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it but does not cause connected panels to collapse.

## Wall of Thorns

*6th-level (conjuration; attack, divine, nature, obscurement, plants, protection)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** Special

**Components:** V, S, M (a length of bramble vine)

**Duration:** Concentration (10 minutes) You create a wall of thorny vines and brush that blocks line of sight on a solid

surface. You can choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick.

When you cast this spell, each creature within its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, but at a cost. It must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves through the wall. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 7d8 slashing damage, or half as much on a successful save.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** Damage dealt by the wall increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

## Warding Bond

*2nd-level (abjuration; divine, protection)*

**Classes:** Cleric **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch

**Target:** One creature

**Components:** V, S, M (pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gold each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)

**Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, the target is warded by a mystic connection between it and you. The target gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage while within 60 feet of you. Each time it takes damage, you take an equal amount of damage.

The spell ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if you use an action to dismiss it, or if the spell is cast again on either you or the target.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.

## Warrior�s Instincts

*5th-level (divination; enhancement, protection, senses)*

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (headband)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

Your senses sharpen. Until the spell ends, creatures cannot gain bonuses (like those granted by *bless* or expertise dice) or advantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, none of your movement provokes opportunity attacks, and you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain. Finally, you can end the spell early to treat a single weapon attack roll as though you had rolled a 15 on the d20.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** For each slot level above 5th, you can also apply this spell�s benefits to an additional creature you can see within 30 feet.

## Water Breathing

*3rd-level (transmutation; arcane, divine, enhancement, utility, water)*

**Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** Up to ten willing creatures you can see

**Components**: V, S, M (piece of cork)

**Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, the targets are able to move across any liquid surface (such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava) as if it were solid ground. Creatures can still take damage from surfaces that would

deliver damage from corrosion or extreme temperatures, but they do not sink while moving across it.

A target submerged in a liquid is moved to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.

## Web

*2nd-level (conjuration; arcane, movement, obscurement)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Area:** 20-foot cube

**Components:** V, S, M (spiderweb) **Duration:** Concentration (1 hour) **Saving Throw:** Dexterity negates Thick, sticky webs fill the area, lightly

obscuring it and making it difficult terrain.

You must anchor the webs between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layer them across a flat surface. If you don�t, the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell ends. Webs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained as long as it remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).

A creature restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.

Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

**Cast at Higher Levels.** When using a 4th-level spell slot, you also summon a **giant wolf spider** in an unoccupied space within the web�s area. When using a

6th-level spell slot, you summon up to two spiders. When using a 7th-level spell slot, you summon up to three spiders. The spiders are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spiders as a group, which have their own turns. The

spiders obey your verbal commands, but they disappear when the spell ends or when they leave the web�s area.

**Rare: Potent Web.** Checks made by restrained creatures to escape the web have disadvantage.

**Rare: Flammable Web.** Any 10-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away instantly, dealing 3d4 fire damage to any creature in the area.

## Weird

*9th-level (illusion; arcane, attack, fear)*

Classes: Wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** 30-foot sphere **Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) You plague creatures with nighmares.

Each creature in the area makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened until the spell ends. At the end of each of a frightened creature�s turns, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

## Whirlwind Kick

*3rd-level (transmutation; movement, thunder, unarmed)*

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Area:** Line up to 60 feet long and 15 feet wide

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You must be able to move in order to cast this spell. You leap into the air, striking foes all around you with supernatural force as you fly up to 60 feet in a straight line. Your movement (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity) must end on a surface that can support your weight or you fall as normal.

As part of the casting of this spell, make a melee spell attack against any number of creatures in the area. On a hit, you deal

your unarmed strike damage plus 2d6 thunder damage. In addition, creatures in the area make a Dexterity saving throw or are either pulled 10 feet closer to you or pushed 10 feet away (your choice).

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The extra thunder damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Wind Up

*1st-level (evocation; enhancement)*

**Classes:** Cleric, herald, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components**: S **Duration:** 8 hours

You gain advantage on the next melee attack roll you make before the end of the spell�s duration, after which the spell ends.

## Wind Walk

*6th-level (transmutation; air, divine, movement,*

*transformation)* **Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Target:** You and up to 10 willing creatures you can see

Components: V, S, M (an animal bladder)

**Duration:** 8 hours

The targets assume a gaseous form and appear as wisps of cloud. Each target has a flying speed of 300 feet and resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons, but the only actions it can take the Dash action or to revert to its normal form (a process that takes 1 minute during which it is incapacitated and can�t move).

Until the spell ends, a target can change again to cloud form (in an identical transformation process).

When the effect ends for a target flying in cloud form, it descends 60 feet each round for up to 1 minute or until it safely lands. If the target can�t land after 1 minute, it falls the rest of the way normally.

## Wind Wall

*3rd-level (evocation; air, attack, divine, protection, weather)*

**Classes:** Druid **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range**: Long (120 feet) **Area**: Special

**Components**: V, S, M (an ivory flute)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You create a wall of strong wind at a point you choose. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall keeps fog, smoke, and other gasses (including creatures in gaseous form) at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can�t pass through. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the area fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss (larger projectiles such as boulders and ballista bolts are unaffected).

**Cast at Higher Levels.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

## Wish

*9th-level (conjuration; arcane)* **Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous You alter reality itself.

The safest use of this spell is the duplication of any other spell of 8th-level or lower without needing to meet its requirements (including components).

You may instead choose one of the following:

* One nonmagical object of your choice that is worth up to 25,000 gold and no more than 300 feet in any dimension appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
* Up to 20 creatures that you can see to regain all their hit points, and each is further healed as per the *greater restoration* spell.
* Up to 10 creatures that you can see gain resistance to a damage type you choose.
* Up to 10 creatures you can see gain immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.
* You force a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). At your discretion, the roll is made with advantage or disadvantage. You can choose to take either the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the Narrator as precisely as possible, being very careful in your wording. Be aware that the greater the *wish*, the greater the chance for an unexpected result. This spell might simply fizzle, your desired outcome might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the *wish*. The Narrator has the final authority in ruling what occurs�and reality is not tampered with lightly.

*Multiple Wishes:* The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.

Until finishing a long rest, each time you cast a spell you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can�t be reduced or prevented. In addition, your Strength drops to 3 for 2d4 days (if it isn�t 3 or lower already). For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33% chance

that you are unable to cast *wish* ever again.

## Word of Recall

*6th-level (conjuration; divine, teleportation)*

**Classes:** Cleric **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 5 feet

**Target:** You and up to 5 willing creatures

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

The targets instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary.

Before using the spell in this way, you must first designate a sanctuary by it within a location aligned with your faith, such as a temple of your deity

**Rare: Expeditious Word of Recall.** Targets instantly teleport to the last location aligned with your faith that you physically entered but have not designated as a sanctuary. Attempts to cast this spell again before 7 days have passed automatically fail.

## Wormway

*6th-level (enchantment; movement, summoning)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 minute (ritual)

**Range:** Special (150 miles)

**Target:** You and up to 50 willing creatures of Large size or smaller

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, the nearest **purple worm** within range is charmed by you and begins moving toward a point on the ground that you can see. If there are no purple worms within range, the spell fails. The earth rumbles slightly as it approaches and breaks through the surface. Any creatures within 20 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw or be

knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from it.

Upon emerging, the purple worm lays down before you and opens its maw.

Targets can climb inside where they are enclosed in an impervious hemispherical dome of force.

Once targets are loaded into the purple worm, nothing�not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects�can pass through the barrier, in or out, though targets in the sphere can breathe there. The hemisphere is immune to all damage, and creatures and objects inside can�t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a target inside the hemisphere damage anything outside it.

The atmosphere inside the dome is comfortable and dry regardless of conditions outside it.

The purple worm waits until you give it a mental command to depart, at which point it dives back into the ground and travels, without need for rest or food, as directly as possible while avoiding obstacles to a destination known to you. It travels 150 miles per day.

When the purple worm reaches its destination it surfaces, the dome vanishes, and it disgorges the targets in its mouth before diving back into the depths again.

The purple worm remains charmed by you until it has delivered you to your destination and returned to the depths, or until it is attacked at which point the charm ends, it vomits its targets in the nearest unoccupied space as soon as possible, and then retreats to safety.

**Rare: Surfacing Wormway.** When this spell ends early because the purple worm is attacked, it travels to the surface to spit the targets out and then retreats to safety.

## Writhing Transformation

*9th-level (transmutation; arcane, evil, transformation)*

**Classes:** Warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 week (ritual)

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (coffin filled with worms, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

As part of the casting of this spell, you lay down in the coffin on a patch of bare earth and it buries itself. Over the following week, you are incapacitated and do not need air, food, or sleep. Your insides are eaten by worms, but you do not die and your skin remains intact. If you are exhumed during this time, or if the spell is otherwise interrupted, you die.

At the end of the week, the transformation is complete and your true form is permanently changed. Your appearance is unchanged but underneath your skin is a sentient mass of worms. Any creature that makes a Medicine check against your spell save DC realizes that there is something moving underneath your skin.

Your statistics change in the following ways:

* Your type changes to aberration, and you do not age or require sleep.
* You cannot be healed by normal means, but you can spend an action or bonus action to consume 2d6 live worms, regaining an equal amount of hit points by adding them to your body.
* You can sense and telepathically control all worms that have the beast type and are within 60 feet of you.

In addition, you are able to discard your shell of skin and travel as a writhing mass of worms. As an action, you can abandon your skin and pour out onto the ground. In this form you have the statistics of a **swarm of insects** with the following exceptions: you keep your hit points, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma scores, and proficiencies.

You know but cannot cast spells in this form. You also gain a burrow speed of 10 feet.

Any worms touching you instantly join with your swarm, granting you a number of

temporary hit points equal to the number of worms that join with your form (maximum 40 temporary hit points). These temporary hit points last until you are no longer in this form.

If you spend an hour in the same space as a dead creature of your original form�s size, you can eat its insides and inhabit its skin in the same way you once inhabited your own. While you are in your swarm form, the most recent skin you inhabited remains intact and you can move back into a previously inhabited skin in 1 minute. You have advantage on checks made to impersonate a creature while wearing its skin.

## Zone of Truth

*2nd-level (enchantment; communication, compulsion, law)*

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, herald **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Medium (60 feet) **Area:** 15-foot sphere **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a zone that minimizes deception. Any creature that is able to be charmed can�t deliberately lie while in the area.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can choose not to speak, or it might be evasive in its communications. A creature that enters the zone for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d4 psychic damage when it intentionally tries to mislead or occlude important information. Each time the spell damages a creature, it makes a Deception check (DC 8 + the damage dealt) or its suffering is obvious. You know whether a creature succeeds on its saving throw.

## Tracked Conditions

Various challenges, obstacles, and magics can lead to either fatigue or strife. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of fatigue or strife (detailed in the effect�s description).

If a creature suffering from fatigue or strife fails to resist another effect that causes a level of the tracked condition, its current level increases by the amount specified in the effect�s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level in a tracked condition as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature

suffering level 3 fatigue has its speed halved, it cannot Sprint, and it makes Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks with disadvantage.

An effect that removes a tracked condition reduces its level as specified in the effect�s description, with all tracked condition effects ending when a creature�s condition level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest at a safe haven reduces a creature�s fatigue and strife levels by 1, provided that the creature has also had Supply to get the most from its rest. A creature does not require a haven to recover from the first level of fatigue or strife, but does still require a long rest. Also, being raised from the dead reduces all of a creature�s tracked conditions by 1.

##### Fatigue

**TABLE: FATIGUE**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **LEVEL EFFECTS** | |
| 1 | Can�t sprint or dash |
| 2 | Disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks |
| 3 | Speed halved and unable to maintain a fast travel pace |
| 4 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws using Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, and unable to maintain a normal travel pace |
| 5 | Hit Dice halved |
| 6 | Speed reduced to 5 ft. and unable to maintain |
| 7 | Doomed |

Keeping a breakneck pace while journeying, feats of great athleticism, and fell magics that sap away life force can wear down

upon the body and cause fatigue. Fatigue represents exhaustion, exposure, hunger, injuries, and other physical factors which gradually wear a creature down. A creature which reaches the 7th level of the fatigue track becomes doomed and dies.

##### Strife

**TABLE: STRIFE**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **LEVEL EFFECTS** | |
| 1 | Disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks |
| 2 | Disadvantage on concentration checks |
| 3 | Can only take a bonus action or action each turn (not both) |
| 4 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws using Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma |
| 5 | Suffer the effects of a randomly determined short-term mental stress effect. |
| 6 | Cannot cast spells (but can cast cantrips) |
| 7 | Suffer the effects of a randomly chosen mental stress effect |

Strife represents corruption, despair, fear, loss of resolve, and other mental factors which gradually undo a creature�s very soul. A creature which reaches the 7th level of the strife track suffers a special, permanent effect, which is either randomly selected or decided by the Narrator. This might involve the creature shutting down completely, or being impacted in such a way that it is forever changed.

## Mental Stress Effects

The rigors of adventuring are not always physical, and players may decide that their experiences have had a lasting effect on their character�s psyche. It�s important to consider mental stress effects in conjunction with safety rules and their potential impact on the game. When a group or the Narrator decides that gamifying mental stress and morale isn�t right for the campaign, respectful roleplay is a viable alternative to these mechanics.

##### Mental Stress Effects

The Narrator may decide that a particular encounter that goes badly can leave a lasting impact on adventurers. Alternatively, if these options are discussed during character creation a player may decide that an event in their past provides sufficient mental stress to bring about a change in their character. These effects provide options for short- and long-term repercussions. A creature may only have one mental stress effect at a time. A

long-term effect overrides a short-term effect, and if two effects are of equal strength, the most recent effect replaces the older effect.

A mental stress effect is usually best chosen based on the encounter that causes it and an adventurer�s personality, but may be randomly determined using the mental stress effect tables.

##### Short-Term Mental Stress Effects

**TABLE: SHORT-TERM MENTAL STRESS EFFECTS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **D10** | **MENTAL STRESS EFFECT** |
| 1 | Bewildered |
| 2 | Cowed |
| 3 | Distraught |
| 4 | Enraged |
| 5 | Flippant |
| 6 | Musical |
| 7 | Obsessed |
| 8 | On Edge |
| 9 | Sleepless |
| 10 | Terrorized |

These conditions are the immediate effects of mental stress after an event or encounter. They last for 1d6 days, but could remain longer based on discussions between the Narrator and player*.*

Bewildered

A bewildered creature is overwhelmed by trying to process a particular event. Its mind begins to play tricks, altering its perceptions. A bewildered creature has disadvantage on social-based ability checks as it struggles to engage with what�s happening. When a bewildered creature would succeed on an ability check, roll another d20. On a result of 15 or less the creature succeeds, but otherwise it fails the ability check instead.

This could be caused by a temporary forgetfulness that leads the creature to forget what it was trying to achieve, or in some cases a brief hallucination that alters

the circumstances in such a way that it is unable to succeed.

Cowed

A cowed creature cannot shake the idea that they are certain to face defeat, and so flinch and surrender at the first sign of danger. After taking any damage in combat, on its next turn a cowed creature takes the Dash action and uses all of its movement to escape danger (or if it is unable to move towards safety, the Dodge action). A cowed creature has disadvantage on Intimidation checks and when given any alternative to combat will happily take it, and it has advantage on Persuasion checks made to try and avoid combat.

Distraught

A distraught creature is visibly and deeply shaken by a recent experience, and its apparent distress moves people to do what they can to help. Once per long rest, a distraught creature can choose to gain advantage on a check made to persuade neutral or friendly creatures to aid it, but it has disadvantage on Deception, Performance, and initiative checks.

Enraged

An enraged creature is unable to shake its frustration with an enemy or its own perceived failings after an encounter. An enraged creature has advantage on Strength checks, but has disadvantage on all other ability checks. Whenever an enraged creature fails an ability check, it throws or attempts to break any tools or objects involved in the check.

Flippant

A flippant creature refuses to face the enormity of whatever event befell it. Not only does a flippant creature superficially shrug off the experience, it goes to reckless ends to prove it is �unaffected� with little regard for itself or allies. A flippant creature has advantage on Dexterity checks, but has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws.

Musical

A musical creature has temporarily taken leave of social norms after a deep shock or strange encounter. Instead of talking, it now sporadically sings its thoughts and during conversation, giving it disadvantage on Deception, Intimidation, and Stealth checks but advantage on Performance checks.

Obsessed

An obsessed creature cannot stop talking about the ordeal that troubles it. It has disadvantage on Stealth checks as it constantly tells allies that it is reminded of �that time when�� Whenever initiative is rolled, an obsessed creature makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or loses 1 round of actions as it wrestles with and exclaims about the similarities to the traumatic encounter in its past.

On Edge

A creature that is on edge is hyperaware of its surroundings and unable to fully relax. An on edge creature has advantage on Perception and initiative checks, but disadvantage on all other ability checks as it is distracted, unable to take its mind off the dangers that could potentially lurk around every corner.

Sleepless

A sleepless creature is unsettled by its encounter and struggles to relax in order to sufficiently rest. Whenever a sleepless creature takes a long rest, it makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to quiet its mind or only gains the benefits of a short rest.

During rests where a sleepless creature has failed its Wisdom save, it has advantage on Perception checks made to detect danger.

Terrorized

A terrorized creature is not just fearful of danger but convinced it is already here. A terrorized creature is unable to shake its fear response from its unsettling encounter, unwilling to go within 30 feet of strangers or participate in melee combat without succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw first (instead taking the Dash action to escape to safety or retreat from a sudden noise). A terrorized creature has advantage on Perception checks and any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution checks made to escape combat or danger, but it will sleep only in places with reasonable security precautions.

##### Long-Term Mental Stress Effects

**TABLE: LONG-TERM MENTAL STRESS EFFECT**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **D10** | **MENTAL STRESS EFFECT** |
| 1 | Covetous |
| 2 | Distorted perceptions |
| 3 | Hopeless |
| 4 | Inimical |
| 5 | Memory Wipe |
| 6 | Murderous |
| 7 | Peacekeeping |
| 8 | Phobia |
| 9 | Superstitious |
| 10 | Suspicious |

These effects denote a more permanent impact made by the mental stress of traumatic encounters.

Covetous

A covetous creature is gripped by a fear of losing in any sense and it begins to desire what is owned by others, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, feeling deprived by that which they do not have. A covetous creature has advantage on Sleight of Hand checks, but disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and Deception checks related to things it has taken.

Distorted Perceptions

A creature with distorted perceptions has been shaken to its core, and perhaps had its mind jolted by interdimensional travel. Whenever a creature with distorted perceptions rolls a Perception check with a

result equal to or less than its passive Perception, small details of the world begin to warp�a swaying tree becomes a dancing shadowy figure, a coil of rope becomes a deadly snake coiled to attack, and its allies may temporarily wear the face of an enemy. These distorted perceptions are brief but absolutely real to the creature.

Discussion between the Narrator and the player of an adventurer with distorted perceptions can determine what kind of hallucinations they�re most likely to have and how far they�d like to take it.

Hopeless

A hopeless creature has completely lost faith in its purpose and finds it difficult to be motivated. A hopeless creature has advantage on Persuasion checks that involve convincing someone not to take a certain course of action, arguing the pointlessness of it all, but it has disadvantage on initiative checks.

Inimical

When an inimical creature is bloodied, on its next turn it takes the Attack action against the nearest creature to it. The inimical creature has disadvantage on these attacks as it flails without control. In addition, an inimical creature has disadvantage on checks and saving throws made against being grappled or restrained.

Memory Wipe

A creature with a memory wipe becomes forgetful in the extreme after its encounter, perhaps not remembering the event at all. A memory wiped creature has disadvantage on Arcana, Culture, History, Nature, and Religion checks, and any other

knowledge-based check as its capacity to

easily recall information is profoundly affected.

Murderous

A murderous creature no longer sees shades of gray when it comes to even the gentlest disagreement or conflict. At the first sign of conflict, whether that be disagreement within the party or a suspicious looking stranger, a murderous creature sees red, attacking first and asking questions later. Dazed by their recklessness, a murderous creature has disadvantage on initiative checks, but advantage on its first attack roll on each of its turns while in such a state. This state lasts for a maximum of 5 rounds, but can be ended earlier by a *calm emotions* spell or DC 18 Persuasion check.

Peacekeeping

A peacekeeping creature wants no more violence and on each of its turns uses all of its actions to prevent or subdue combat by every nonviolent method at its disposal, continuing this course of action until it or an ally are bloodied. A peacekeeping creature has disadvantage on initiative checks but advantage on its first ability check made to try and end a combat.

Phobia

A traumatic encounter leads a creature to have a long-term, debilitating fear of some element of the encounter. For example, narrowly escaping a burning building may leave a creature with a phobia of fire. When encountering the subject of its phobia, a creature makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a success the creature can act normally, but on a failure it is frightened for 1 minute (at the Narrator�s discretion, depending on the situation it may be

incapacitated instead). At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the saving throw, able to act normally on a success.

Superstitious

A creature comes to believe it has survived its traumatic encounter thanks only to the presence of a lucky charm. This charm can be anything it had on its person at the time of the event. The superstitious creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws whenever it is more than 30 feet away from its charm, except for Investigation or Perception checks to find the charm again (which are made with advantage).

Suspicious

A suspicious creature has lost faith in the goodness of the people and circumstances around it. A suspicious creature has advantage on Sleight of Hand checks, and Perception checks to detect hidden foes, but it has disadvantage on Insight checks as it is unable to objectively interpret intentions.

##### Indefinite Mental Stress

It may be that a creature encounters a situation that inflicts indefinite effects on its psyche. In this case it may have one or more of any of the above mental stress effects, with no time limits imposed. The Narrator should decide which effects and how many. A creature can only suffer from multiple mental stress effects if one or more are indefinite mental stress effects.

##### Saving Throws

Saving throws can be used to determine how a creature handles the mental stress of a particular encounter. When a creature fails a saving throw by 10 or more or rolls a

critical failure on a saving throw, it may acquire a short-term mental stress effect determined by what the save was made for. In a tougher encounter, at the Narrator�s discretion a success may mean that a creature is left with a short-term mental stress effect, and on a failure it instead acquires a long-term mental stress effect.

Wisdom or Charisma saving throws are most likely to relate to a creature�s mental fortitude, however Intelligence or Constitution may be more applicable based on the encounter.

##### Spell Effects

Some spells such as *contact other plane* and *symbol* involve potential impacts on the mind of a creature. Rather than using the described spell effects, the Narrator may substitute a short- or long-term mental stress effect.

##### Relieving Mental Stress Effects

In a world where even death is not necessarily the end, there are also options to recover from the mental impacts of overwhelming events.

Roleplay

In the same way that danger sometimes passes without combat, conditions that impact an adventurer�s psyche (rather than their physical self) can be resolved through effective roleplay. Roleplaying an important resolution for a PC (or even an important NPC) may bring an end to their condition�this might be reuniting with a significant person from their past, finally defeating a sworn enemy, or simply being soothed by the companionship and protection of their allies.

Healing Magic

Short- and long-term mental stress effects can usually be removed with a *greater restoration* spell (although the Narrator may set other conditions) and temporarily relieved by the *calm emotions* spell (until the spell ends).

**Other Magic.** The obvious restorative properties of healing magic are effective, but powerful illusions or even spells that alter reality have the potential to end mental stress effects.

##### Personality Changes

A failed saving throw may not lead to a mental stress effect. In some cases after discussion with the group, the Narrator may decide that a particular event leads to a far more fundamental change. The nature of this change and the status of an adventurer�s mental stress effect afterward (it may become a long-term mental stress effect, indefinite, change to a short-term mental stress effect, or be removed entirely) are at the Narrator�s discretion.
