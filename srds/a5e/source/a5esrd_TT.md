# Encounter Design

## Exploration Encounters

Exploration entails traveling from one location to another and overcoming whatever challenges the world throws at the adventurers. These are primarily encapsulated by Exploration Challenges.

**Dungeons.** What constitutes a dungeon can vary widely, but so long as there�s a floor beneath their feet, walls around them, and a ceiling overhead with danger lurking around each corner they�re exploring.

**Planar Travel.** When a campaign gets the party beyond the realms material and into other dimensions they�ll encounter unfamiliar flora and fauna, denizens they may not even recognize as sentient beings, and wonders they�ll never forget. These journeys can be especially perilous and the powerful magic usually required for them will take adventurers far from their homes, but inspire tales that are retold for centuries.

**Urban.** Settlements are the primary places where social encounters occur, but can offer a number of other challenges and obstacles.

**Wilderness.** Most exploration roleplay happens between other types of encounters as the party makes their way through the world, whether by air, land, or sea.

## Social Encounters

Whenever the adventurers are interacting nonviolently with NPCs (or maybe sometimes just a little bit violently) they are having some kind of social encounter.

**Convince.** A fundamental reason for the party to interact socially with NPCs is because they want something. The primary means of convincing others will be their actual roleplaying (what the adventurers say and do), and at the GM�s discretion the use of social skills like

Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion. This isn�t to suggest that other skills (like Arcana, Culture, History and so on) don�t have a role here, but unless it�s a specific situation (such as distracting a fellow mage, an aristocrat, or an historian) they are not the primary means of achieving what the party is after.

**Develop.** Every social encounter is an opportunity for players to make it clear who their adventurer is, what they�re about, and to discover how they are changed by the world around them and the conflicts they�ve endured. These interactions are vital in making a group feel like they have a stake in what�s going on in the campaign, and can provide narrative resources that might become powerful motivators for other important factors in the game.

**Entertain.** Social encounters don�t always have to have hidden motives or intended goals, and giving players the opportunity to simply exist in the campaign gives the experience a certain sense of realism. There are other stories being woven around them, not every conflict bears an imminent threat, and even for adventurers there can be pleasant lulls between lethal battles and deadly dungeon delves.

**Inform.** Probably the most likely reason for social encounters is to provide information to the players.

**Occlude.** Just as there are times when the adventurers are trying to convince someone to do something, there are occasions where adventurers will need to act so that someone does *not* do something by concealing important information (thus removing the impetus to act). Typically this is a matter of Deception but might also be a Stealth check or opposed Investigation check.

## Combat Encounters

There are two main ways to build a combat scene:

**Challenge-Based Encounter.** The Narrator may set out to prepare a fun, challenging combat encounter and chooses opponents accordingly.

**Story-Based Encounter.** Often the story and player actions determine the nature of a conflict. There�s no guarantee that a fight is winnable: the party must deal with the consequences of their choices.

In either case, the Narrator will want to know whether a fight is likely to be trivial, unwinnable, or somewhere in between. In a challenge-based encounter, the Narrator wants to aim for a middle ground of difficulty. In a story-based encounter, the Narrator may want to signal to the adventurers when they�re about to bite off more than they can chew. It�s rarely fun when a crushing defeat or an easy victory is a surprise to everyone (including the Narrator).

To determine the likely challenge posed by a battle, compare its combat encounter difficulty and its maximum monster CR to the party�s capabilities.

### Combat Encounter Difficulty

Combat encounter difficulty is evaluated by comparing the **encounter CR** (the total CR of all opponents) to the **total character level**. The ratio of these two numbers determines the challenge presented by the matchup.

**Allies.** If the adventurers have monster or NPC allies, add their CR � 3 to the total character level.

**Elites.** When calculating the encounter CR, double the CR of elite monsters.

Encounter challenge ratings are flexible and can allow for many different types of battles. For instance, a CR 10 encounter could consist of one CR 10 monster, two CR 5 monsters, one CR 5 leader with five CR 1 minions, and so on.

Here�s how adventurers stack up against monsters:

#### Easy Matchup

* A battle in which the encounter CR approximately equals 1/6th the total character level.
* A fight which isn�t in doubt that drains little or no resources from the party.
* An easy battle is an appropriate challenge for a tier 1 party, which can probably handle three or four such encounters before needing a long rest. Higher-level parties can face many easy battles in a row.

#### Medium Matchup

* A battle in which the encounter CR approximately equals 1/3rd the total character level.
* A fight which isn�t in doubt but may cost the adventurers a few spells or healing resources.
* Between long rests, the party can probably fight at most two such battles per tier (2 medium fights at 1st level, 8 medium fights at 17th level).

#### Hard Matchup

* A battle in which the encounter CR approximately equals 1/2 the total character level.
* A fight in which the adventurers must spend significant resources to triumph. Losing is possible but the odds are on the party�s side.
* Between long rests, the party can probably face 1 such battle per tier (1 hard fight at 1st level, 4 hard fights at 17th level).
* For a tier 1 party, a hard battle can easily prove to be deadly.

#### Deadly Matchup

* + A battle in which the encounter CR approximately equals 2/3rd the total character level.
  + A fight in which winning and losing are both possible. The party must spend its best resources.
  + A well-rested party of at least 5th level can handle 1 such battle.
  + Tier 1 parties should rarely if ever face deadly battles.

#### Impossible Matchup

* A battle in which the encounter CR equals or exceeds total character level.
* A fight which is almost certain to result in the adventurers losing.
* A high level party of optimized adventurers might be able to routinely win some battles which are rated as impossible.

### Low Level Adventurers and Low CR Monsters

Tier 0 adventurers are not extremely tough yet. They have very few hit points and spell slots, as well as limited access to area attacks. A low level party can be easily swamped by large numbers of low CR monsters.

When determining encounter CR for tier 0 or tier 1 adventurers, treat any monster with a CR below 1 as if its CR were one step higher. Thus a CR 0 monster is effectively a CR 1/8 monster when calculating encounter CR, a CR 1/2 monster is effectively a CR 1 monster, and so on. For example, a group of three 1st level adventurers (total character level 3) against two goblins (effective CR 1/2 each, encounter CR 1) is a medium challenge.

**TABLE: TIER 0 AND TIER 1 EFFECTIVE ENCOUNTER CR**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **ACTUAL MONSTER CR** | **EFFECTIVE CR** |
| 0 | 1/8 |
| 1/8 | 1/4 |
| 1/4 | 1/2 |
| 1/2 | 1 |

### Party Optimization

The Combat Encounter Difficulty guidelines assume a party with a standard amount of magical treasure, a healthy but not overwhelming interest in tactics, and a balanced composition of classes that includes a spellcaster or two.

If adventurers are more interested in story immersion and character than in combat, or they possess fewer magic items than usual, then they may prefer mostly easy matchups with a few medium ones thrown in. Similarly, some party compositions, like an all-rogue party, are best suited for easy combat challenges and difficult exploration and social encounters.

If a party is composed of highly experienced players looking for a combat challenge, and they�re playing optimized adventurers of 5th level or higher, the players may relish frequent hard and deadly matchups. They may even want to try their hands at impossible matchups. Similarly, battles can be made more difficult in a campaign rich with magical treasure.

### Maximum Monster CR

An encounter�s **maximum monster CR** is the challenge rating of the single toughest opponent in the encounter.

Adventurers are rarely able to fight a satisfying battle against a monster with a CR that�s much higher than a single adventurer�s level. Such a monster has a high chance of dropping an adventurer from full health to 0 hit points in a single hit, and its defenses and saving throw DCs may

make it more deadly than expected. Even if a battle looks possible when comparing the total character level and encounter CR, **it is an impossible matchup if the maximum monster CR is higher than 1.5 � the average character level**.

### Using Elite Monsters

An elite monster is a powerful opponent designed to provide a tough challenge to a large group of players. Often, an elite monster is a variant of another monster: a leader, champion, or even a named individual.

An elite monster has approximately twice the hit points and deals around 50% more damage than a normal monster of its CR�and it usually becomes more dangerous as the battle goes on.

An elite monster poses the same challenge as two non-elite monsters of its challenge rating.

When determining encounter CR, double the challenge rating of an elite monster.

However, elite monsters have attacks, defenses, and saving throw DCs that make them suitable opponents for lower level adventurers. When determining the maximum monster CR of an encounter, use its actual CR.

### Using Legendary Monsters

A legendary monster is designed to be an interesting combatant for multiple adventurers. With up to 3 legendary actions, and possibly extra bonus actions and reactions as well, it has the extra turns it needs to keep up with as many as three adventurers.

As with any other monster, a legendary monster is at its best when its CR is, at most, 1.5 � the average character level. A maximally tough legendary monster like this is a hard matchup for 3 adventurers, a medium matchup for 4 adventurers, and will probably be easy for 5 or more adventurers.

When designing a climactic, set-piece battle against a legendary monster, make

sure to provide it some allies or minions if it�s facing 4 or more adventurers.

### The Adventuring Day

As a rule of thumb for how many battles a party can likely handle before it needs a long rest, use a daily budget of **encounter points**.

* A party at tier 0 (1st-2nd level) has 1 encounter point.
* A party at tier 1 (3rd-4th level) has 2 encounter points
* A party at tier 2 (5th-10th level) has 4 encounter points.
* A party at tier 3 (11th-16th level) has 6 encounter points.
* A party at tier 4 (17th-20th level) has 8 encounter points

For each encounter point it possesses, a party can face one medium encounter before needing a rest. An easy battle costs half an encounter point. A hard battle costs 2 encounter points. A deadly battle costs 4 encounter points.

A low level party can face four easy battles or two medium battles before needing a long rest, and a single hard battle could drain them of resources. A high level party could expect to win through a deadly battle and still have resources to spare, though a second deadly battle might put them in a perilous situation.

This encounter budget is an estimate, and is superseded by the Narrator�s experience with a particular gaming group�some adventurers may not have the resources to meet these benchmarks, and some may blow past them. There�s no rule that says that a party needs to fight a certain number of encounters before bedtime, and the pacing of the adventuring day should be based on the desires of the players and the needs of the story.

### Combat Encounter Types

One of the ways to keep combat fresh is to vary the types of battles that the players face. If a game session includes multiple combats their difficulty should be varied. A steady diet of hard encounters can be exhausting for adventurers so a few medium or easy battles should be included if the story allows for it.

The composition of battles can vary too. Some class features and attacks (like a rogue�s Sneak Attack) are very effective against a single monster, while others (like a wizard�s *fireball*) shine against large groups. Varied encounter composition gives everyone a turn in the spotlight and, conversely, forces everyone to improvise when their go-to moves aren�t optimal. Here are some typical combat encounter compositions.

**Solo Fight.** Sometimes the story dictates that the players battle a single enemy, such as a dragon. It�s possible to make this a challenging and satisfying battle, though the opponent is starting off at a disadvantage�no matter how much damage a normal monster dishes out, it�s limited by the number of turns it can take compared to a party of heroes. Legendary and especially elite monsters make the best solo opponents.

A legendary monster with a challenge rating equal to or 50% higher than average party level can provide a medium to hard battle against three or four adventurers. For a larger party, an elite monster of this challenge rating is required to provide the same challenge.

**Boss and Minions.** If circumstances require a big showdown with a single tough opponent, it often makes a lot of sense for this tough enemy to be accompanied by lesser monsters. An archmage or a powerful demon will never let itself be caught alone.

A tough monster with a CR equal to the average party level can keep two or three adventurers busy. For each additional adventurer, add monsters with a CR of 1/3 the adventurer�s level.

**Commander and Troops.** This is similar to a boss and minions battle, but the troops (not the commander) make up the bulk of the challenge. The commander may provide boosts to its allies.

A monster with a CR of up to 1/2 the average party level can match one adventurer. Each additional adventurer can handle two monsters with a CR up to 1/4 their level each.

**Team vs. Team.** In this type of battle the numbers of adventurers and monsters are roughly equal. Depending on the desired level of difficulty, the CR of the opposition could be between 1/3 and 1/2 average party level.

**Horde.** Sometimes a party finds itself wading through an army of lowly mooks. This kind of battle will be very easy for adventurers with access to area attack spells like *fireball*. On the other hand, it might overwhelm a party of rogues or other adventurers that specialize in damaging a single enemy.

Depending on its composition, a party might be able to deal with a force up to five times its size as long as the total CR of all enemies isn�t higher than half the total character level (remember that for tier 1 adventurers, fractional CRs are doubled!)

### Combat Encounter Complications

There are many ways to vary combat encounters other than altering the number of combatants. Unique details of terrain, goals, and enemy strategies create story, add vividness, and unlock tactical options.

**Alternate Goals.** When an encounter isn�t a battle of attrition, the outcome is determined more by story and circumstance than by encounter guidelines and challenge rating. In a fight featuring a complex trap or other goal, the party is trying to perform some noncombat task while surviving an enemy onslaught.

**Ranged Attackers.** Ranged attackers, like archers and spellcasters, do best when they�re difficult to reach. Intelligent ranged attackers will arrange to fight behind a barrier, such as a wall or a melee bodyguard.

**Shifting Alliances.** Instead of two, a battle might be composed of three or more factions. The two weakest sides might form a temporary alliance in order to prevent the stronger side from reaching victory�but betrayal is likely.

**Terrain and Hazards.** Every conflict is set somewhere, and a vividly described location enhances a scene on a visceral and tactical level. A battlefield with high ground, obstacles, and difficult terrain allows both sides to seek advantage.

Usable objects beg adventurers to interact with them.

Choke points like doors are tactically useful�so much so that they can come to dominate a battle, causing gridlock. When there�s a strategically important choke point like a door, it can be good to add an alternate route so that clever attackers can outflank defenders. As choke points go, bridges can be more fun than doors (creatures can be pushed off bridges).

Hazards like steep cliffs and lava pools can be treated like a combatant, boosting the encounter CR of the fight. See Encounter Elements for common combat hazards like frigid water, lava, and yellow mold.

**Waves.** When reinforcements appear halfway through a fight the overall combat is easier than if both groups had appeared together, but harder than two successive battles with a chance to rest in between. This technique can be used to calibrate the difficulty of a battle and to increase tension as the fight goes on. A second group might notice and respond to a conflict, or it might be scheduled to arrive as part of a regular patrol. Possibly an enemy rings an alarm bell or runs to call for reinforcements, and the second wave doesn�t arrive if the messenger is stopped.

### Failure in a Combat Encounter

When preparing a combat encounter� especially a challenging one�it helps to consider what failure might look like. Not every battle is a fight to the death with no quarter given, and while failure may lead to consequences and further difficulties for the *adventurers*, it doesn�t need to be bad news for the *players*..

The Narrator probably has an idea of what will occur if the adventurers are triumphant in a battle. But if the adventurers lose, what happens next?

* **Do the adventurers escape but suffer a plot setback?** What does that look like? If the party is pursuing an important item, it might mean that their enemies obtain it instead. A mission to retrieve it�perhaps a heist�could be a fun followup adventure.
* **Does the plot change course?** Perhaps a party�s ship is attacked by pirates. On a failure, the adventurers might find themselves chained to oars in the pirate galley, and the next session�s mission is to escape and recover their equipment from the captain�s cabin.
* **Are the stakes heightened?** A failure may advance a villain�s plans, bringing the world one step closer to a cataclysmic event. Perhaps it results in danger to a valued NPC ally. A combat failure might give the adventurers a glimpse at what�s at risk, propelling the campaign towards a more dramatic finale.
* **Are the adventurers killed?** Death does happen. If the plot demands it, failure might result in death for an adventurer or even a dreaded total party kill. However, if a battle will be

difficult and failure will result in death, make sure the players are aware of the stakes beforehand. Give them a choice about whether and when to engage in the battle. Unless everyone is on board, it�s unwise to stake the future of a campaign on a battle that�s unavoidable, deadly, and difficult to win.

### Elite Monsters and Failure

A battle against an elite monster can be one of the riskiest and most taxing combat challenges. In such a battle, consider alternatives to total victory or crushing defeat.

If a party manages to reduce an elite monster to half its hit points, they�ve already done very well. They�ve dealt enough damage to defeat a normal monster of its type. Their reward, of course, is that the monster starts hitting twice as hard. The battle becomes more dangerous just when the party may have used up its best resources�which heightens the tension, and not coincidentally, the danger of the encounter.

When adventurers are down to their last few hit points and spells, and an elite monster is bloodied but not beaten, consider whether the monster really wants to fight to the death. An intelligent creature may be ready to retreat or be amenable to a truce, perhaps even offering treasure if the party will leave it alone. After all, it�s been beaten half to death itself and it could probably use a rest! The adventurers may have earned its grudging respect, and it might want them alive as captives or even allies. There are many ways that a valiant but unsuccessful battle against an elite monster can lead to a partial victory.

## Encounter Elements

The world can be a dangerous place and the environment might pose a deadly threat all by itself. In addition to their inherent danger, encounter elements offer ways to enhance the perils of exploration challenges or combat to make both more satisfying.

### Acid

A creature that touches acid takes 5 (2d4) acid damage. When a creature first enters into an area of acid or starts its turn there, it takes 10 (4d4) ongoing acid damage. A creature submerged in acid takes 25 (10d4) ongoing acid damage. This damage persists for 3 rounds after the creature leaves the acid. A creature ends all ongoing damage from mundane acid by using its action to wipe away the corrosive liquid.

### Brown Mold

Brown mold subsists on heat, drawing away warmth from the environment and creatures around it. Most patches of brown mold have only a 10-foot radius, but the temperature in a 30-foot radius around it is unnaturally cold.

When a creature moves within 5 feet of the brown mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

Brown mold is not only immune to fire damage but rapidly grows when exposed to flames. When any source of fire happens within 5 feet of a patch of brown mold, the brown mold rapidly expands to surround it in a 10-foot radius. However, any amount of cold damage instantly destroys a patch of brown mold.

### Crowd

Throngs of humanoids are difficult terrain, and a creature surrounded by a crowd has disadvantage on hearing- and sight-based checks to perceive outside of it.

In addition, making attacks in a crowd risks collateral damage and the wrath of the throng. When a creature attacks from within a crowd or attacks a target within a crowd, on a miss by 10 or more the attack hits a crowd member and the creature makes a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check (DC 13 + 2 per previous check) to convince the crowd not to attack it. On a failure, the crowd transforms into a **commoner mob** and attacks, fighting until the creature is reduced to 0 hit points or the commoner mob is bloodied.

### Darkness

Darkness comes in two varieties: magical and nonmagical. In nonmagical darkness, creatures with darkvision can see out to the range specified by that trait as if it were dim light. In magical darkness, all vision is blocked. Creatures without darkvision cannot see in mundane or magical darkness. In addition, a frightened creature unable to see because of magical darkness is rattled.

### Dense Smoke

Creatures and objects in an area of dense smoke are heavily obscured. When a creature that needs to breathe starts its turn in an area of dense smoke, if it is not holding its breath it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + 1 per round previous turn in the dense smoke, maximum DC 20) or it begins to suffocate. A creature that covers its mouth and nose with a damp cloth has advantage on this save. Finally, smell-based checks to perceive or track creatures that have spent more than 1 round in an area of dense smoke have advantage until the creature finishes a long rest or takes at least 10 minutes to clean the smoke from itself.

### Extreme Cold

At the end of every hour a creature is exposed to temperatures at or below 0� Fahrenheit (�18� Celsius), it makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffers a level of fatigue. Resistance to cold damage, immunity to cold damage, or wearing cold weather gear grants an automatic success on this save. Creatures native to an extreme cold environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

Saving throws made against effects or spells that deal cold damage have disadvantage.

### Extreme Heat

At the end of every hour a creature is exposed to temperatures at or above 100� Fahrenheit (38� Celsius), it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 4 + 1 per hour spent in extreme heat) or suffers a level of fatigue. Resistance to fire damage, immunity to fire damage, or keeping a light pack (less than half carrying capacity) grants an automatic success on this save, whereas a creature wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or heavy clothing has disadvantage. Creatures native to an extreme heat environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

Saving throws made against effects or spells that deal fire damage have disadvantage.

### Falling

The quickest way to severe harm (or even death) is from falling. Whether from a rooftop, cliff�s edge, treetop, or flying mount, falling can deal a devastating amount of damage. When a creature falls, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it falls (maximum 20d6) and lands prone.

A creature that falls into water takes half damage, or no damage if it dives with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to the distance it falls divided by 5).

### Fire

An area of fire sheds bright light to 10 feet beyond its edges and dim light an additional 10 feet. A creature that touches fire takes 7 (2d6) ongoing fire damage. A creature may end ongoing damage from mundane fire by spending an action to extinguish the flames. Smoke and heat shimmer lightly obscure anything within or on the other side of an area of fire.

Frigid Water

After being in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score, a creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or it suffers a level of fatigue. Resistance or immunity to cold damage grants an automatic success on this save. Creatures native to an extreme cold environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

### Green Slime

This sticky, vibrantly green, slopping slime clings to and mercilessly eats away at flesh, plants, and even metal.

Green slime covers a 5-foot square area or larger, though rarely greater in size than a 20-foot radius. Although it is alive and able to sense with blindsight to a range of 30 feet, green slime has no Intelligence or other ability scores. When green slime senses movement underneath it, it drops towards the ground. A creature in the green slime�s area makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, becoming slimed on a failure.

A slimed creature takes 5 (1d10) ongoing acid damage until the green slime is scraped off with an action. Green slime is destroyed by sunlight, any feature, spell, or trait that cures disease, or any amount of cold, fire, or radiant damage. Wood or metal exposed to green slime instead takes 11 (2d10) acid damage.

### Heavy Precipitation

Heavy snowfall makes an area lightly obscured, and Perception checks relying on sight are made with disadvantage. Heavy rain has the same effects, also affecting Perception checks that rely on hearing and extinguishing any open flames.

### High Gravity

The ranges of ranged weapons are halved, as are all jump distances. When a creature makes its first attack in a round using a weapon that does not have the

dual-wielding property, it makes a DC 12 Athletics check or subtracts 1d4 from its attack rolls for 1 round. Falling damage is treated as twice the distance in the area and there is no maximum amount of damage that can be taken from a fall. For every hour spent in the area, a creature not acclimated to it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the number of hours spent in the area) or gain a level of fatigue (maximum 4 levels of fatigue).

### Lava

A creature that touches lava takes 16 (3d10) ongoing fire damage. When a creature first enters into an area of lava or starts its turn there, it takes 33 (6d10) ongoing fire damage. A creature submerged in lava takes 55 (10d10) ongoing fire damage. This damage persists for 4 rounds after the creature leaves the lava. A creature ends all ongoing damage from lava by using its action to wipe away the molten rock.

### Low Gravity

The ranges of ranged weapons are doubled, as are all jump distances. Falling damage is treated as half the distance in the area. In addition, damage from bludgeoning weapons is reduced by half.

### Magnetized Ore

Magnetized ore wreaks havoc on the use of compasses or any natural sense of direction, making both useless within 500 feet.

While within 50 feet of magnetized ore, a creature wearing heavy armor made from metal or attacking with a metal weapon has disadvantage on its attack rolls, Strength and Dexterity checks, and saving throws made against fatigue.

### Memory Crystals

Recognizing a memory crystal for what it is requires a DC 20 Arcana check. When a creature with prepared spells is within 30 feet of a memory crystal, at the start of its turn it must make a DC 15 spellcasting ability check or lose one randomly determined prepared spell.

When destroyed (DC 17 Strength check, AC 7, 2 hit points) a memory crystal explodes with dangerous magic in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area makes a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

An area filled with memory crystals requires a creature to succeed on a DC 8 Acrobatics check at the end of each of its turns to avoid breaking any of the dangerous gemstones.

### Miring Ground

Sludge, tar, or sufficiently deep and sticky mud can provide real danger to creatures caught in them.

Miring ground is difficult terrain. In addition, when a creature starts its turn in miring ground, it begins to sink and makes an Athletics check (DC 12 + 2 per round spent in the area) to continue moving. On a failure, its Speed is reduced by 10 feet.

When this reduces a creature�s Speed to 5 feet or less it begins sinking 1 foot deeper into the miring ground at the end of each of its turns. A sinking creature can be freed with an Athletics check equal to the DC of

its last failed check against the miring ground. A sinking creature that becomes submerged begins suffocating if it is unable to hold its breath. Any creature trying to aid a sinking creature must have a solid surface to stand on or a fly speed, but can use ropes or similar means to do so at a distance.

### Poisonous Plants

Spotting the telltale signs of vegetation dangerous to touch requires a DC 15 Nature check. Poisonous plants can be as sparse as a few shrubs or as pervasive as fields of harmful groundcover.

When a creature starts its turn within the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failure, or half damage on

a success.

### Rushing Liquid

Standing in rushing liquid halves the speed of a creature moving against the current and doubles the speed of creatures moving with it. At the start of each of its turns, a creature in knee-high rushing liquid makes an Acrobatics or Athletics check to keep its footing. On a failure, it is knocked prone and moves a number of feet in the direction of the current equal to the amount it failed the check by (rounded up to the nearest 5 feet). The check is DC 11 if the rushing liquid is knee-high, DC 14 if waist-high, DC 17 if chest-high, and DC 20 if the creature�s feet cannot touch the bottom. A creature moving with the current has disadvantage on this check. A creature driven into a solid object by the current (such as a rock) takes damage as if it had fallen a number of feet equal to the distance it was moved by the current (minimum 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage). Standing up from prone in rushing liquid requires an Acrobatics or Athletics check with a DC equal to the DC to keep footing. A creature that loses its footing is considered

underwater (see below) until it regains its footing.

### Strong Winds

Ranged weapon attacks and Perception checks that rely on hearing have disadvantage in high winds. In addition, it extinguishes any open flames, disperses fogs and smoke, and forces any flying creature to land before the end of its turn or fall.

### Underwater

A creature that cannot breathe water begins to suffocate underwater once it cannot hold its breath. In addition, creatures without swim speeds have disadvantage on attacks made using any weapon other than a dagger, dueling dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss beyond their normal range underwater, and bludgeoning and fire damage are halved. A creature that takes damage while holding its breath underwater must succeed on a concentration check or immediately begin suffocating as if its breath had run out.

### Vacuum

An area of vacuum has no air, so creatures that need to breathe must use another source of air or begin to suffocate once they cannot hold their breath. In addition, the area carries no sound, so hearing-based checks made to perceive automatically fail and spells with vocalized components cannot be cast. A creature with its own air supply may cast spells with vocalized components, but still cannot hear. Vacuum is also utterly chilling, dealing 11 (3d6) cold damage to a creature at the start of each of its turns in the area.

### Webs

Whether created by massive insects or swarms of smaller creatures, these sticky strands ensnare and capture creatures that

fall afoul of them. An area of webs is difficult terrain, and when a creature starts its turn within the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or becomes restrained. Restrained creatures can use an action to make a DC 12 Acrobatics or Athletics check, escaping on a success.

A 10-foot cube of webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.

### Yellow Mold

This sickeningly yellow mold only grows in dark places and is extremely sensitive to movement nearby.

Yellow mold covers a 10-foot radius area. When a creature moves within 30 feet of a patch of yellow mold, at the start of its turn spores are released and it makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 11 (2d10) ongoing poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute, continuing to take ongoing damage until it is no longer poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Yellow mold is destroyed by sunlight or any amount of fire damage.

## Combining Combat Encounters and Exploration Challenges

When battle breaks out in the middle of an exploration challenge as long as one complicates the other, to calculate the encounter CR add the challenge rating of each together just like multiple monsters..

The difficulty of a fight against a monster, besting an exploration challenge, or overcoming an encounter element in either is measured by challenge rating, or CR. A challenge rating helps guide the Narrator in choosing appropriate challenges for a group of adventurers and denotes the amount of experience points to be rewarded afterward. For a short, easy-to-remember summary of these rules, judge a potential encounter by asking the following questions:

* Is the total Challenge Rating of all the monsters close to half the total character level? If so, the combat encounter will be hard. If the total CR is lower than this, the battle will be easier; as the CR gets higher, the battle gets harder. If the total CR equals or exceeds the total character level, the combat may be impossible to win!
* Are there any monsters with a CR 50% higher than the average character level? If so, the battle may be deadlier than anticipated.
* Are the adventurers level 4 or lower? Keep battles on the easier side, especially against many foes! For low-level adventurers, a few unlucky die rolls can turn a possible battle into an impossible one.

# Exploration

## The Journey

At the heart of exploration is the journey, or the story that happens while the adventurers travel from origin to destination

� surviving the elements, discovering new places, and overcoming the obstacles presented by the environment.

Before a journey, the party sets their travel pace, or how fast they�d like to go. The Narrator determines the difficulty of the journey itself and the number of encounters the adventurers have on the journey. Some encounters might be a fight against one or more monsters or happening across other travelers, but they�ll also have to contend with the world itself in exploration challenges.

### Navigation

When the adventurers have a map (see Survival Gear) there is little chance of them getting lost. The mystery lies in the time it takes them to reach their destination, and the challenges that they face along the way. Without a map, adventurers always know which region (see below) they are in, but are not usually aware of adjacent regions (unless one of them takes the Scout journey activity). They can journey from region to region, making choices along the way � for example, the party might be in Rolling Grasslands, and need to decide between hiking Lofty Mountains or chancing a Feywood as their next step before finally reaching some safe Open Roads leading to their destination.

### Travel Pace

Adventurers can travel at a normal, fast, or slow pace, which determines the distance they cover in a day of travel (see Table: Travel Pace). While a fast pace might shorten the time required for a journey,

moving so quickly makes travelers less aware of the dangers around them.

Likewise, a steadier slow pace prolongs a journey but adventurers can stay alert, cover their tracks, and move more stealthily. The effects from traveling faster than a slow pace are cumulative.

**Fatigue.** Creatures suffering from two or more levels of fatigue cannot travel faster than at a normal pace. Creatures suffering from three or more levels of fatigue cannot travel faster than at a slow pace. Creatures suffering from four or more levels of fatigue cannot travel faster than a crawl.

**TABLE: TRAVEL PACE**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PACE** | **MINUTE** | **HOUR** | **DAY** | **EFFECT** |
| Crawl | 50 feet | 1/2 mile | 4  miles | Advantage on Survival checks to cover tracks |
| Slow/ Wagon | 200 feet | 2  miles | 16  miles | � |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3  miles | 24  miles | Unable to use Stealth |
| Fast/ Mounted | 400 feet | 4  miles | 32  miles | �5 penalty to passive Perception and disadvantage on Perception checks |
| Gallop | 800 feet | 8  miles\* | � | Disadvantage on Survival checks to track |

*\* A mount can only travel at gallop speed for 1 hour each day. Otherwise it travels at the fast/mounted pace.*

#### Forced March

Adventurers on a journey can travel for up to 8 hours in a day before requiring a long rest to reinvigorate themselves and continue

� any further and they may exhaust themselves. For every additional hour of travel past 8 hours, an adventurer makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour (DC 10 + the number of additional hours of travel), suffering a level of fatigue on a failure. The party can set the pace, increasing the DC of the saving throw for a normal pace (+1) or fast/mounted pace (+2).

#### Mounts and Pack Animals

Mounts such as riding horses can only travel for about an hour a day at the gallop pace listed in Table: Travel Pace. While mounts and pack animals may be useful on a journey, they are also a responsibility � each mount requires its own Supply, may have difficulty traveling in different kinds of environments, and can become a liability during certain exploration challenges. For example, it may be difficult to lead a mount through a swampy area or have it traverse a landslide.

#### Resting and Havens

While on a journey, adventurers are only able to recover from 2 or more levels of fatigue or strife on a long rest when they have access to a haven. A haven is a place to get a meal and a full night�s sleep without the reasonable risk of attack or harm from the elements. For example, an inn is considered a haven, but a campsite where adventurers must take turns keeping watch through the night is not. Some spells and class features may create havens.

#### Tracking Supply

Mundane consumable items like food and water are simplified into a single item called Supply. When an adventurer gains access to food and water, they can add Supply to their inventory. Basic rations (dry food and water) usually costs 5 silver for 1 Supply, but finer foods may cost more.

* 1 Supply consists of enough combined food and water to sustain a Small- or Medium- sized creature for a day.
* Large-sized creatures require 2 Supply each day. Creatures of Huge size or larger require an amount of Supply determined by the Narrator.
* A creature can carry a number of Supply equal to its Strength score in addition to the rest of its gear. A Large-sized creature can carry Supply equal to twice its Strength score.
* Whenever a creature takes a long rest, it must consume Supply. If it does not, it gains a level of fatigue.
* At the Narrator�s discretion a beast can hunt, forage, or graze before taking a long rest, only requiring Supply if the region is not plentiful enough for it to do so.
* Supply consumed while in another form (like while under the effects of a polymorphing spell or a druid�s wild shape) is wasted and provides no nourishment when a creature returns to its normal form.

When adventurers run out of Supply while journeying, they can access more in a few ways. Some journey activities allow adventurers to forage for more food and water. Boons and discoveries, which are common rewards for exploration challenges, may lead to more Supply. As a last resort, the party may need to take a detour to the nearest town, find a wandering merchant, or even abandon the journey and head home.

#### Vehicles

Not all travel is done by foot or hoof. Vehicles are used by many adventurers to help travel the vast distances of the world.

**Land Vehicles.** Wagons and carts are unable to go faster than a slow pace, but some land vehicles can choose at which pace to move. Stealth cannot be used while journeying in a land vehicle, and they require a DC 13 land vehicle check every day spent traveling at a fast pace. On a failure, the vehicle suffers a malfunction.

**Water Vehicles.** Water vehicles are restricted by the speed of the vehicle and gain no benefits from a slow pace, but have no penalties for moving at a fast pace. Depending on the vehicle and crew size, a ship can travel up to 24 hours a day.

### Regions

A region is an area of the world, defined geographically by its physical features. It might be a vast forest or a sandy desert; or it might be a snow-tipped mountain range or a stretch of underground caverns. Regions are often � but not always � named areas on the map. Regions are important building blocks of the world, and each region has its own properties and encounter tables. Later in this chapter are some common regions for Narrators to use.

**Combined Regions.** Sometimes an area on the map might fit the description of more than one region. The Narrator may choose either region, combine both, or create a new region.

**Terrains.** A region can have more than one kind of terrain and those listed are general suggestions for the most common types to be found there. Ultimately the types of terrain in a region are at the Narrator�s discretion and the needs of the campaign.

**Regions and Tiers.** Each region on the map is designated with a tier (from 0�4) which corresponds with the adventuring tiers of play. Any region can be any tier.

A region�s tier determines the difficulty of the challenges encountered within.

Exploration and monster encounter tables are all categorized by tier, making it easy to select tier-relevant encounters. Of course, exceptions can and do exist, and a powerful monster can wander into a

low-tier region, but such an occurrence is not typical of that region and is usually used as the subject of an adventure rather than a random encounter.

It should be noted that it is possible for a low-level party to wander into a region too dangerous for them. The Narrator should provide clues to the danger level and � where appropriate � allow for some means of escape should the adventurers find themselves in over their heads.

**Party-Appropriate Challenges.** In some games the Narrator may prefer not to designate regions with a default tier, and instead present the adventurers with

encounters and challenges appropriate for their level.

#### Weather

Each region contains a short list of randomly generated weather options. These are generally limited to non-extreme weather conditions, including clear, overcast, mist, rain, and snow, and are purely descriptive tools to help the Narrator set the scene � they do not affect the adventurers. More extreme weather events are treated as exploration challenges (see page 106) and include phenomena like blizzards, dense fogs, hail storms, sandstorms, tornados, thunderstorms, and more.

Roll a d20 for weather once for each region. In the winter season, add 5 to the roll, unless the region is in a notably warm or tropical clime. Occasionally, exploration challenges result in extreme weather events. These include the following.

* + Blinding Blizzard (CR 1)
  + Choking Smoke (CR 11)
  + Dense Fog (CR 6)
  + Flash Flood (CR 6)
  + Flood (CR 3)
  + Hail Deluge (CR 8)
  + Hail Storm (CR 1)
  + Haze (CR 1/4)
  + Hoar Frost (CR 15)
  + Killing Cloud (CR 18)
  + Primordial Tornado (CR 12)
  + Sandstorm (CR 7)
  + Sunspots (CR 11)
  + Thunderstorm (CR 3)
  + Tornado (CR 10)
  + Tsunami (CR 17)

#### Encounters

Each region the adventurers travel through will include one or more encounters. The Narrator decides how many encounters the party has.

Encounters include four categories: exploration challenges, monsters, social encounters, and scenery. It is important that

the players do not know which type of encounter they�ve stumbled into � it should be introduced to them narratively. That chill feeling might be mere scenery, but it might be the sign of some kind of undead spirit, or it might foreshadow a weather event.

Each region presents encounter tables which include all four encounter types. The Narrator can roll on these tables, choose an option, or introduce something new.

Along a journey the Narrator should employ a mix of combat encounters, social encounters, exploration challenges, and scenery. Exploration challenges, which are detailed later, have assigned tiers and challenge ratings that correspond to adventurers� levels. It is assumed that

high-level adventurers are able to pass tier 1 exploration challenges without much effort, but a tier 4 exploration challenge poses a major threat.

Ultimately how many encounters adventurers have while traveling is at the discretion of the Narrator, but in general it�s recommended that the party has at least one encounter (combat, exploration, or social) in every region they journey through to make it memorable. Some regions are going to have more encounters than other regions � either because they are tumultuous, the area plays an important part in the campaign, or they are large in size � and the types of encounters the party might have in a given region are listed in its Exploring table. Depending on the needs of the game and campaign setting, the types of encounters, frequency of encounters, and difficulty of certain journey activities might be different.

### Journey Activities

Adventurers have the option to participate in activities while traveling in order to pick up some extra resources, improve the conditions of their journey, or learn more about the world around them.

**Difficulty Class.** The DC of a journey activity is based on the region�s tier: tier 0

� DC 10, tier 1 � DC 12, tier 2 � DC

14, tier 3 � DC 16, tier 4 � DC 18.

Depending on the region, some journey activities are made with either advantage or disadvantage

**Experienced Travelers.** The Busk and Rob journey activities are most profitable for novice adventurers, but experienced travelers can sometimes pick out a mark carrying confidential materials instead of gold, and nobles seek out performers of note wherever they might be. Additionally, when an adventurer is attempting to gather a specific component of 100 gold or less with Gather Components, they can roll with disadvantage, finding it on a success.

**Modifying DC.** The Narrator can raise the DC on a journey activity based on extenuating circumstances. Here are some suggestions for modifying a journey activity�s difficulty class:

* **Inclement Weather (+2)** may impede an adventurer�s ability to search for things with the Scout activity, or lead to fewer people on the road (making the Busk and Rob activities more difficult).
* **Multitasking (+3)** such as attempting a journey activity while trying not to be discovered, may make it harder to attempt the check.
* **Hostile Territory (+4)** may make it difficult to interact with the locals, impeding a check made to Busk or Gossip. It may be dangerous to stop, so taking the Pray activity or using Scout is harder to do.

Adventurers choose how long (in days) to engage in an activity, making a single check for that duration, and many activities grant additional rewards based on the time spent doing them. For example, when using the Busk activity, a PC gains gold for each day they perform that activity. An adventurer is free to divide their travel across a region into different activities, performing each for a number of days. When determining how

many days the adventurer is undertaking an activity for, count the total number of days and roll once, even if those days are not consecutive. When to make a check for a journey activity is determined by what region it is made in and otherwise at the Narrator�s discretion.

Adventurers usually choose one journey activity for the entire region, and many activities grant additional rewards based on the time spent doing them. For example, when using the Busk activity, a PC gains gold for each day they perform that activity. The number of days spent is determined by the size of the region and the party's travel speed.

When making an ability check for a journey activity, the check is made at the start of the region. An adventurer may achieve a success or a failure, or a critical success or a critical failure, each with a different outcome which applies while the party remains in that region.

#### Befriend Animal

An adventurer can make friends with a wild animal (a beast with a challenge rating equal to or less than 1/3rd the party�s total level) by succeeding on an Animal Handling check.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer scares or angers the animal, which attacks them.

**Failure.** The adventurer is unable to befriend the animal.

**Success.** The adventurer befriends one animal. The animal follows the party through the region until it spots danger.

Adventurers can assume that when the animal runs off that something dangerous is following them or hidden nearby. The adventurer who befriended the creature can then make a Perception check contested by the hidden creature�s Stealth check in order to spot the danger.

**Critical Success.** As a success, but the animal also leads the adventurer to a Boon or Discovery. Additionally, the adventurer gains advantage on their Perception check to spot a hidden

danger. Only one such boon can be gained per region.

#### Busk

Adventurers can entertain passersby with a successful Acrobatics, Athletics, or Performance check.

**Note:** To perform this journey activity, the party must be in a populated area such as a Country Shire, Open Roads, or an Urban Township.

**Critical Failure.** Passersby steal 3d4 gold from the adventurer.

**Failure.** The adventurer earns no money.

**Success.** The adventurer gains 1 gold per day of travel plus 1 gold for each point they beat the DC by.

**Critical Success.** The adventurer gains 2 gold per day of travel plus 1 gold for each point they beat the DC by, and one passerby gifts them with a random magical item worth 50 gold or less. Only one such gift can be earned per region.

#### Chronicle

An adventurer that spends their time writing down observations of local landmarks, recording various customs, or charting a map can make a History check. The adventurer must spend the entire region undertaking this activity.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer slips, falls, or otherwise bumbles during the journey, destroying their journaling scrolls or the book they were writing in.

**Failure.** The adventurer fails to record anything of note or value.

**Success.** The adventurer gains an expertise die on current or future History or Survival checks made within or about the region.

**Critical Success.** As a success, and the adventurer discovers a Boon or Discovery about the region. Only one such boon can be gained per region.

#### Cook

By acting as the party�s cook and quartermaster, with a cook�s utensils or Survival check an adventurer can help ensure that everybody remains fed.

**Critical Failure.** For every two creatures being fed, the Supply requirement to feed them is increased by 1 Supply.

**Failure.** The cooking is adequate, but has no special effects.

**Success.**The daily Supply requirement to feed the party is reduced by

one-quarter (round down to a minimum of 1 Supply) up to a maximum number of creatures equal to twice the adventurer�s proficiency bonus.

**Critical Success.** As a success, and each creature being fed gains one additional hit die to spend on each day they are fed by the adventurer.

#### Cover Tracks

While moving at a slow pace, an adventurer can cover the party�s tracks with a Survival check so that it is harder for pursuers to follow. The adventurer�s Survival check result is the DC for any pursuer�s Survival check to track them.

**Critical Failure.** The party leaves an obvious trail, and their pursuers gain a day�s worth of travel covering the distance between them for each day spent doing this journey activity.

**Failure.** The party leaves a trail, and their pursuers continue to harass them.

**Success.** The party manages to put an extra day between themselves and their pursuers for each day spent doing this journey activity.

**Critical Success.** The party lose their pursuers.

#### Entertain

With a successful Performance check an adventurer can help keep the party�s spirits high. Each party member can only benefit from this journey activity once per week.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer�s performance is so bad that the party gains a level of strife.

**Failure.** The party is not entertained.

**Success.**The first time the adventurer or an ally, up to a number of creatures equal to the adventurer's proficiency bonus, would suffer a level of strife, they do not. When there is more than one member of the party that can benefit from this journey activity (like when the entire party makes saving throws against strife at the same time), the adventurer that performed chooses who benefits.

**Critical Success.** The adventurer and any allies each recover one level of fatigue or strife. This benefit can only be gained by each adventurer once per week.

#### Gather Components

Adventurers that gather supplies useful for the material components of spellcasting can make an Arcana or Nature check.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses their prey.

**Success.** The party continues to follow their prey.

**Critical Success.** The adventurer finds an obvious trail, and the party gains a day�s worth of travel covering the distance between them and their prey for each day spent doing this journey activity.

In some campaigns the wilderness is just the gap between dungeons and plot points, and in others battling against the elements and nature is a major focus. Consider the following two alternate methods of supply tracking to better fit the campaign:

**Casual Supplies.** These rules are best used in adventures where surviving the elements is not a major theme.

* A creature is assumed to eat and care for itself as needed and rations are not tracked.
* As long as a creature has access to its gear, it�s assumed to have packed enough food and water to sustain itself during any journey.

**Desperate Supplies.** Adventures where wilderness survival is the primary theme are best served with these rules.

* All mundane consumable items must be tracked separately and must be stored in proper containers (see Containers, Chapter 4: Equipment in the *Adventurer�s Guide*).
* Throughout the course of a day, Medium-sized creatures must consume at least 1 pound of food and 1 gallon (8 pounds) of water (or half as much if Small-sized, or twice as much if Large-sized). When a creature completes a long rest without having consumed its required food and water, it gains a level of fatigue.

### Blasted Badlands

Home to faeries, sprites, dryads, nymphs, satyrs, and other fey, the animals in this forest are bold and only foolish travelers fail to respect nature as they go along their way. Adventurers journeying through regions like this contend with frequent combat encounters, social encounters, and natural terrain and supernatural exploration challenges.

**Terrains.** Forest, grassland, hills, jungle, mountains, ruins, settlement, subterranean, swamp, temple, tomb.

**Tiers.** Feywoods often range from tier 1 through tier 4. While a tier 1 Feywood presents little danger other than from wildlife and the occasional faeries, a tier 4 Feywood might be a dangerous plane like the Dreaming, or the domain of an ancient green dragon.

**Weather.** 1�15 clear, 16�19 mist, 20�25 rain.

**Fey Promises.** When an adventurer breaks a promise made in a Feywood they suffer a level of strife.

**Natural Camouflage.** Adventurers gain an expertise die on Stealth checks.

**Journey Activities.** When making a check to Harvest or to Hunt and Gather, an adventurer rolls with advantage.

Social Encounter

### Fiery Hellscape

From active volcanoes to the hottest layers of Hell, these regions are dominated by red-hot lava flows and flaming geysers.

Adventurers journeying through these regions can expect to encounter many natural terrain challenges and dangerous creatures.

**Terrains.** Desert, laboratory, mountains, ruins, subterranean, temple, tomb.

**Tiers.** These regions lend themselves towards danger and are usually tier 3 or tier 4. A higher tier Fiery Hellscape might be found on a plane of elemental fire or the volcanic domain of a red dragon.

Lower tier versions of these regions are rare, but might be found naturally occurring in some places.

**Weather.** Uncomfortably warm.

**Hot.** Traveling at faster than a slow pace is dangerous in the region�s hot temperatures, and adventurers that do so suffer a level of fatigue when taking a long rest (even if they have Supply). The use of appropriate mounts (such as camels) and keeping a light pack (less than half carrying capacity) allow for adventurers to travel as fast as a normal pace without suffering fatigue during a long rest.

**Unquenchable Thirst.** Twice the usual amount of Supply is required when taking a long rest.

**Journey Activities.** Checks to Harvest or Hunt and Gather are made at disadvantage. It is not possible to Busk.

### Flowing River

Rivers can provide a convenient and fast way to travel. Encounters are less frequent, and the journey is less arduous.

**Terrains.** Any; most river regions extend from at least one region into one or more other regions.

**Tiers.** It�s unusual (although not impossible) for rivers to be above tier 2.

**Weather.** 1�8 clear, 9�12 overcast,

13�16 rain, 17�19 mist, 20�25 snow.

**Vehicles.** Adventurers move at the speed of their water vehicles.

**Journey Activities.** Adventurers gain advantage on Survival checks made to Hunt and Gather due to abundant fishing opportunities. Checks made to Hide Tracks automatically succeed, and those made to Track automatically fail. It is not possible to Busk.

Endless fields of white and imposing mountains stretching towards the sky fill this icy land, and though it is rather devoid of life it is a place of great peril. Adventurers journeying through this region have to overcome many natural terrain and weather event exploration challenges, and perhaps a few combat or social encounters.

**Terrains.** Arctic, hills, mountains, ruins, subterranean, temple, tomb, water.

**Tiers.** Arctic-like tundra can range from tier 2 to tier 4 depending on the severity of its climate.

**Weather.** 1�6 clear, 7�12 overcast,

13�25 snow.

**Chilly.** Without the proper gear or magic to survive the cold temperatures (see Survival Gear), an adventurer suffers a level of fatigue when taking a long rest in this environment (even if it has Supply).

**Journey Activities.** Adventurers gain advantage on Survival checks made to find a target using tracks left in the snow. Checks made to hide tracks have disadvantage. It is not possible to Busk.

Social Encounter

### Haunted Lands

Settlements that have suffered a curse, or areas which are home to powerful undead beings, typically have effects that spread far from the source bringing woe to the people living nearby and attracting prowling monsters and ominous signs. Adventurers journeying through regions like this have plenty of combat encounters, some social encounters, and many circumstance or supernatural exploration challenges.

**Terrains.** Any.

**Tiers.** Haunted lands are often higher tier areas. The corrupted realm surrounding a dread knight�s castle or a county ruled over by a sinister vampire would likely be tier 3 or higher.

**Weather.** 1�5 clear, 6�10 overcast,

11�15 foggy, 16�25 rain.

**Bleak Light.** All light sources illuminate only half the area they would normally cover.

**Night Terrors.** It is difficult to get a restful night�s sleep in this area.

Adventurers make a Wisdom saving throw against the region�s journey activity DC when taking a long rest or suffer a level of strife.

**Suspicious Minds.** The people who inhabit this area are wary and suspicious of strangers. Adventurers have disadvantage on Charisma checks made against people local to the region.

**Journey Activities.** The Entertain activity is made with disadvantage. The Pray activity is made with disadvantage if your deity has the Good alignment.

### Lofty Mountains

Legends from all over the realm speak of remote passes, cataclysmic conflicts and relics of fell power within the ancient ruins of temples to defeated evils, the graves of terrible warlords, and sites of unspeakable rituals. Adventurers journeying through this region have few social encounters, a moderate amount of combat encounters, and many constructed terrain, natural terrain, and supernatural exploration challenges.

**Terrains.** Arctic, hills, jungle, mountains, ruins, settlement, subterranean, temple, tomb.

**Tiers.** Idyllic mountain ranges might be tier 1, while cliffs and crags ruled over by an ancient dragon would be tier 4.

**Weather.** 1�8 clear, 9�12 overcast,

13�16 mist, 17�18 rain, 19�25 snow.

**Climbable.** The terrain offers numerous footholds and pitted surfaces.

Adventurers gain an expertise die on checks made to climb.

**High Altitude.** Breathing air gets harder at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level, and adventurers not used to the reduced oxygen tire easily. Every hour spent traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours of travel for the purposes of travel pace. For example, after 4 hours of travel a creature makes forced march checks every half hour.

After spending 30 days or longer at high altitude an adventurer becomes acclimated to it and can travel normally. Altitudes above 20,000 feet can only be acclimated to by creatures native to the environment.

**Mountsbane.** Travel time is doubled for mounts and pack animals.

### Open Roads

Well-traveled roads with wide tracks, and plentiful inns, villages, and other stopping points along the way make some journeys less arduous than others. Adventurers journeying along country roads have many social encounters, combat encounters with NPCs or the occasional wild beast, and circumstance and constructed terrain exploration challenges.

**Terrains.** Any; most road regions extend from at least one region into one or more other regions.

**Tiers.** It�s unusual (although not impossible) for open roads to be above tier 2.

**Weather.** 1�8 clear, 9�12 overcast,

13�16 rain, 17�19 mist, 20�25 snow.

**Fast Travel.** Adventurers move one mile

Social Encounter

### Parched Sands

Endless dunes and the baking sun make these deserts difficult and dangerous places in which to survive. Adventurers journeying through this region have very few social encounters.

**Terrains.** Desert, grassland, hills, mountains, ruins, settlement, subterranean, temple, tomb.

**Tiers.** A desert region with numerous oases might be tier 1, but most are tier 2 or higher.

**Weather.** 1�25 clear.

**Hot.** Traveling at faster than a slow pace is dangerous in the region�s hot temperatures, and adventurers that do so suffer a level of fatigue when taking a long rest (even if they have Supply). The use of appropriate mounts (such as camels) and keeping a light pack (less than half carrying capacity) allow for adventurers to travel as fast as a normal pace without suffering fatigue during a long rest.

**Unquenchable Thirst.** Twice the usual amount of Supply is required when taking a long rest.

**Journey Activities.** It is not possible to Busk. Checks to Harvest or Hunt and Gather are made at disadvantage.

Rapid currents and quick trade routes make these waters popular with merchants, but only the bravest and most skilled sailors are willing to chance the frequent, dangerous, and unpredictable waves. Adventurers journeying through this region or along its coast have to overcome an unusually high number of weather event exploration challenges, as well as some combat encounters and social encounters.

There is no map�even among the subterranean cultures that dwell within�that accurately depicts all of these enormous tunnels, which range from natural caverns and dwarven mines to shadow elf cities. Adventurers journeying through this region have combat encounters, some social encounters, and many constructed terrain, natural terrain, and supernatural exploration challenges.

**Terrains.** Forest, jungle, laboratory, ruins, settlement, subterranean, swamp, temple, tomb, water.

**Tiers.** It�s unusual for these regions to be less than tier 2.

**Weather.** 1�16 clear, 17�25 mist.

**Resonant.** Adventurers gain an expertise die on sound-based Perception checks.

**Unstable.** When an adventurer creates a force that would disturb a

non-stoneworked area (an explosion, loud sound, or shaping the structure of the cave through magic), roll 1d20. On a result of 20 the activity causes a cave-in. One passageway in the cave is filled with fallen rocks 20 feet wide.

So named because time seems to slow to a crawl while traversing its swamps, this area is rife with dangerous predators, lethal fauna, and ground best left untrusted.

Adventurers journeying through this region have frequent combat encounters, a few social encounters, and many natural terrain exploration challenges.

**Terrains.** Forest, grassland, hills, jungle, ruins, settlement, swamp, temple, tomb, water.

**Tiers.** Swamp regions with friendly inhabitants might be tier 1, but more hostile places (oft ruled over by ancient dragons or worse) can easily be tier 4.

**Weather.** 1�5 clear, 6�8 overcast, 9�15

rain, 16�25 mist.

**Hard to Hoof.** Mounts and pack animals are unable to travel at a fast pace or gallop pace. Additionally, wheeled vehicles cannot travel faster than a crawl.

**Journey Activities.** Plants harvested during a journey activity are typically very rare. Adventurers gain an expertise die on checks made to Harvest, but on a critical failure the plants are carnivorous, and the adventurer suffers one level of fatigue.

An occupied nation, or one amidst a civil war, is a dubious place populated with aggressive soldiers, desperate commoners, and merciless opportunists. Adventurers journeying through this region have many social encounters, combat encounters against NPCs, and both circumstance and natural terrain exploration challenges as they navigate the country in conflict.

**Terrains.** Any.

**Tiers.** Nascent counties skirmishing against one another might merit tier 1, but when larger nations take umbrage against one another they usually merit being tier 2 or even tier 3.

**Weather.** 1�8 clear, 9�12 overcast,

13�16 rain, 17�19 mist, 20�25 snow. The Narrator may substitute a weather roll based on the terrain (like rolling a Lofty Mountains weather roll in a Wartorn Kingdom in a mountain range).

**Journey Activities.** The Busk journey activity is made with disadvantage due to the wary and suspicious nature of other travelers.

Desolate crypts, ancient temples, horrifying tombs, and cursed pyramids are often filled with traps and monsters. Unlike the natural caverns of most of the underland realm, a dungeon is usually constructed and can be above or below ground. Although dungeons aren�t regions (so there is no weather or travel scenery, and adventurers don�t undertake journey activities in a dungeon) they are filled with random encounters against both traps and monsters, and these areas are ripe with opportunities for exploration!

**Terrains.** Dungeons can be found everywhere, and depending on their size and location they may have a wide variety of terrains within (though laboratory, ruins, sewer, temple, and tomb are the most common).

**Tier.** Dungeons range from tier 0 crypts in small villages all the way up to the deadliest tier 4 labyrinths of terror constructed by ancient evils.

Narrators can use travel scenery to heighten the sense of adventure and mystery, introduce new quests, or tweak them to help guide a wayward party back to an important task they�ve left unfinished.

# Exploration Challenges

Some exploration challenges are straightforward sequences like crossing a rickety bridge, escaping a patch of quicksand, or bypassing a dangerous trap. Others involve prevailing against massive snowstorms, negotiating supernatural phenomena, or traversing seas of sandy dunes.

## Tiers

An adventuring party should be expected to trivially overcome exploration challenges from a lower tier of play. While the exploration challenge might be narrated in order to give more flavor to the journey, there is no need to individually run lower-tier exploration challenges.

## Challenge

Exploration challenges have challenge ratings, much like monsters do, which helps the Narrator to determine appropriate encounters for the party and how much experience is rewarded for an exploration challenge successfully overcome.

Each exploration challenge also includes two Difficulty Classes. The first is used when individual ability checks or saving throws are being made, and the second is used for group checks.

## Area

An entire region is sometimes an exploration challenge � arctic expanses, demanding deserts, or turbulent seas � and others might relate to the immediate vicinity. Each exploration challenge includes a suggested size and the typical time to traverse it at a normal pace. The Narrator should use a map of the world the game is

set in to determine the appropriate area for any exploration challenge.

**Immediate.** This exploration challenge affects the immediate area around the party; it�s likely about 100 feet or so across, but is almost certainly under 1 mile. It takes less than 1 hour to traverse at normal pace.

**Local.** This exploration challenge is up to 3 miles (1 league) across, and takes 1 hour to traverse at normal pace.

**Intermediate.** This exploration challenge is up to 10 miles across and takes 3 hours to traverse at normal pace.

**Greater.** This is the distance a party can usually walk in a day at normal pace, and is up to 30 miles across.

**Region.** This exploration challenge covers the entire region the party is currently traveling in. Its exact size depends on the size of the region.

**TABLE: EXPLORATION CHALLENGE SIZES**

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AREA** | **SIZE** | **CRAWL (1 MPH)** | **SLOW/WAGON (2MPH)** | **NORMAL (3 MPH)** | **FAST/MOUNTED (4 MPH)** | **GALLOP (8 MPH)** |
| Immediate | Up to 1 mile | Less than 1 hour | Less than 1 hour | Less than 1 hour | Less than 1 hour Less than  1 hour | |
| Local | Up to 3 miles | 6 hours | 1 1/2 hours | 1 hour | 1 hour | Less than 1 hour |
| Intermediate Up to 10 miles | | 2 days | 5 hours | 3 hours | 2 hours | 1 hour |
| Greater | Up to 30 miles | 1 week | 2 days | 1 day | 6 hours | 4 hours |
| Region | Varies | Varies | Varies | Varies | Varies | Varies |

## Running Exploration Challenges

Exploration challenges are designed to be free-form, allowing the Narrator a great deal of latitude when adjudicating them. The exploration challenges in this book contain guidelines to assist the Narrator in this task, but they are not meant to be binding or constraining.

Each entry details the various traits of the exploration challenge, what its effects are, and what the outcome of certain ability checks or actions might be.

**Suggested Solutions.** Each exploration challenge contains one or more example ways to resolve it. Players are encouraged to come up with inventive solutions, and a clever idea or an appropriate expenditure of a spell or resource can be rewarded with success, or with advantage on one or more checks made.

**Travel Time.** Many exploration challenges include effects which are dependent on the amount of time spent overcoming them. The party�s travel pace (normal travel pace is 3 miles per hour, slow is 2 miles per hour, and fast is 4 miles per hour) and the exploration challenge�s size should be established as

normal in order to determine how long the adventurers remain in the area. Some exploration challenges affect the party�s travel pace, or are affected by the pace at which the party moves.

**Outcomes.** Each exploration challenge also lists some possible outcomes. These outcomes are graded into four categories, from critical failures up to critical successes (see Exploration Challenges: Success and Failure). It is entirely up to the Narrator which outcome the adventurers qualify for, depending on the actions they take. An inventive solution might immediately qualify them for a critical success, as might a group check in which everybody succeeds, and a critical failure might be triggered by a disastrous decision, but the Narrator ultimately decides what the outcome of an exploration challenge is and what rewards are granted or penalties accrued.

Some results � especially when a group check has been made � may affect the entire party, while others may affect only a single adventurer. The Narrator should determine who is affected based on the actions being taken.

Failing an exploration challenge does not halt the journey, but it does usually mean that the adventurers suffer some kind of penalty. Typical penalties include the loss of time or Supply, or gaining fatigue or strife, while rewards include

Boons and Discoveries, as well as experience.

**Avoiding.** At the Narrator�s discretion, some exploration challenges might be avoided by backtracking and taking a different route; if the party chooses to do this, they will typically lose some travel time and will not earn any experience for the exploration challenge, but they do not have to face it. The time to avoid an exploration challenge is equal to quadruple the time it would normally take to traverse the area.

**Telling a Story.** Exploration challenges are designed to be inserted seamlessly into an adventure. The Narrator should never announce that an exploration challenge is in progress, or present the players with a list of options or potential actions.

## Exploration Challenges: Success and Failure

The outcomes of exploration challenges range from the very worst results to the very best.

**Critical Failure.** A disastrous decision or action, a group check in which everybody fails, or a single check which results in a Critical Failure. This often results in penalties such as fatigue or strife, time, or loss of Supply. No experience is gained.

**Failure.** A bad decision or action, a group check in which half or less of the party succeed, or a single check which results in a failure. This often results in penalties such as loss of Supply or time. No experience is gained.

**Success.** An appropriate solution, a group check in which more than half the party succeed, or a single check which results in a success. The party gains experience equal to half the exploration challenge�s CR.

**Critical Success.** An optimal solution, a group check in which the whole party succeeds, or a single check which results

in a critical success. The party gains experience equal to the exploration challenge�s CR, and often a boon or discovery.

## Group Checks

Group checks take place when the entire party is engaged in a single task. In a group check, every player makes an ability check. If more than half of the group succeeds in their check, the group as a whole succeeds. If half or less of the group succeed, the group as a whole fails.

When an exploration challenge mentions a group check, the Narrator should allow adventurers to use different skills or abilities where appropriate. Not all adventurers have to make the same check, as long as each is contributing in some way.

**Group Criticals.** A critical success is achieved when all members of the party succeed in their checks, while a critical failure takes place if all members of the party fail.

### Acid Field

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); DC 17/15

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Strange black spots mar the sparse ground ahead. After a few moments of observation, it�s clear why � acidic fluid erupts from fissures in the ground!

**Acidic Spray.** Every half hour spent traveling in this area a corrosive geyser explodes near the party sending acid in a 60-foot radius. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage on a failure.

**Nature.** A Nature check reveals to the party that their Supply is vulnerable to the corrosive atmosphere.

**Protecting Provisions.** An Engineering check (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) allows each adventurer to adequately protect any

Supply they are carrying. This check must be made before the Supply is destroyed.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Survival check is made to adequately protect the adventurers and safely traverse the area.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses 6 (2d4

+ 1) Supply to the corrosive atmosphere, and each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue from acid burns.

**Failure.** The party loses 2 Supply to the corrosive atmosphere and any adventurer that failed their check suffers a level of fatigue from acid burns.

**Success.** The adventurers make it through the area successfully.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers make it through the area successfully and they notice something important. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Blinding Blizzard

*0th tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); DC 13/13

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Heavy snowfall blasts the countryside reducing visibility to just a few feet. Travel through the area is even harder than usual as slips, trips, and falls are difficult to see.

**High Winds.** Ranged attacks are made with disadvantage, unattended and poorly secured objects fly off in the wind, and flying is nearly impossible (requiring an Acrobatics check each minute to avoid plummeting to the ground).

**Intense Cold.** At the end of every hour spent traveling through this area, a creature makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 5 + 2 per previous save) or it takes 3 (1d6) cold damage.

**Reduced Visibility.** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 10 feet. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Survival check allows the party to find or construct shelter and outlast the storm. Alternatively an Athletics check (or Animal Handling if mounted) can be used to outrun the storm.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses 5 (2d4) hours of travel time facing the storm head on. In addition, each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply that�s dropped or ripped away by the wind then quickly covered in sweeping layers of snow.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose a day of travel as they get lost due to covered landmarks, disorientation from the storm, and the need to move more slowly at times to avoid danger.

**Success.** The adventurers either find a small alcove and can wait out the storm in relative comfort, losing 5 (2d4) hours, or successfully outrun it losing no time.

**Critical Success.** The winds shift and the worst of the storm passes the adventurers by.

### Bridge of Sorrow

*3rd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 13 (10,000 XP); DC 19/16

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A narrow bridge made of polished black marble crosses a deep and fast-flowing river ahead. Ominous clouds cover the sky in a

2-mile radius, casting the area into shadow. Each adventurer feels an urge to plunge into the water, and the entire area dampens their very spirits.

**Suppressing Aura.** All magic within the shadow of the clouds is suppressed (as if in an antimagic field). In addition, each of the adventurers sees visions of their worst fears reflected in the bridge.

#### Possible Solutions

The bridge is physically safe to cross, as long as the adventurers can resist the urges tugging at their minds. A group check focused on bolstering the party�s resolve is needed. For example, a Performance check to lift the party�s spirits, a Religion check to

recall and recite an inspiring prayer, or a Wisdom check to keep the oppressive magic at bay

Alternatively a boat or raft and a group Survival check (rolled with advantage for any characters with proficiency with both Survival and water vehicles) can be made to cross the river without setting foot on the bridge.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers are compelled to plunge into the river 60 feet below, each making an Athletics check to dive, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage from impacting the water, or half damage on a success. In addition, they each suffer two levels of strife.

**Failure.** They make it across, but their very souls are dampened. Each adventurer suffers a level of strife.

**Success.** The adventurers cross the perilous bridge without incident.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers cross the perilous bridge without incident, stronger for having been tested. For the next 11 (2d6 + 4) days they have advantage on saving throws made against mental stress effects. Roll twice on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Bridge of Stones

*0th tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A fast-flowing 150-foot wide river is crossable only by a series of slick, unstable stepping stones. The river isn�t especially deep, but the current is strong. Any adventurer or mount that falls in is carried 30 feet downstream at the end of each of their turns.

**Boulders.** An Athletics check can be made to lift and brace one of the boulders, granting advantage to checks made to cross the river (or, if a rope is already tied, to gain an expertise die).

**Nature.** A Nature check reveals that the waters will be lower tomorrow and crossing will be less hazardous. Crossing at that time triggers an automatic success.

**Ropes.** Checks to cross the bridge are made with advantage if a rope is tied across the river.

#### Possible Solutions

Make a group Acrobatics check to cross the bridge.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers fall into the water, losing a day�s worth of travel and 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Failure.** Each adventurer that fails the check falls into the water and loses 1 Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers cross safely.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers leave the bridge safer for those who come after, and they discover a gift or clue leading to something important left for them whenever they return. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Choking Smoke

*3rd tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

A massive forest fire, volcanic ash, hellish fumaroles, or a burning city have covered the landscape in a thick suffocating cloud.

**Choking Smog.** At the end of every hour in this area, creatures make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failure. A creature that is immune to poison damage or does not need to breathe automatically succeeds on this save. Any creature that takes a 40 or more poison damage from the smog becomes poisoned, and a poisoned creature that fails its saving throw suffers one level of fatigue. A poisoned creature that critically fails its saving throw falls unconscious for 60 (1d12 � 10) minutes.

**Face Coverings.** The use of 1 Supply worth of water adequately wets a cloth or face-covering for 2 (1d4) hours, granting a creature wearing it advantage on Constitution saving throws against the smog�s effects.

**Hazy Vision.** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 30 feet. In

addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

**Keep Low.** An adventurer can make an Investigation check to find areas free of smog to get re-oriented and help navigate the area. On a success, the party gains an expertise die on ability checks made against this challenge.

**Spell Solve.** The smoke can be temporarily blown away by the casting of a *gust of wind* spell, giving the adventurers advantage on checks and saving throws made against it.

#### Possible Solutions

Make a group Survival check to safely traverse.

**Critical Failure.** The winds shift and the smog seems to follow the adventurers like a hungry predator. Navigating away from it takes 5 (2d4) hours of travel time.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose 2 (1d4) hours of travel time navigating through the smog.

**Success.** The adventurers make it through a thin bank of the smog and are only exposed to it for 1 hour.

**Critical Success.** A confluence of timing and luck sees the weather take a turn for the better and the adventurers are not slowed at all by the smog. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

Bypassing the choking smoke is possible but difficult as the air currents and raging fires can spread if unmonitored and controlled. Safely traveling around it costs an extra 3 (1d4 + 1) days of travel time.

### Caught in the Crossfire

*3rd tier (circumstance)*

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Two warring factions or armies have made the adventurers� travel route their battleground, fighting with weapons and spells both near and at range. The conflict

may or may not concern the party, but their first priority is continuing on their journey � and cutting directly through is a potentially lethal endeavor.

#### Possible Solutions

Make a group Acrobatics check to deftly maneuver through the battlefield.

Alternatively, one Persuasion check can negotiate a momentary ceasefire to pass through safely.

**Critical Failure.** The party is caught in the crossfire and each adventurer suffers two levels of fatigue � they are unable to pass and must take a different route, losing 6 (1d4 + 2) hours of travel.

**Failure.** The party is caught in the crossfire and each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue � it takes them a full 3 (1d6) hours of travel to traverse the battlefield.

**Success.** The adventurers find a safe way through the battlefield, losing 1 hour of travel.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers find a safe way through the conflict and they find treasures on the dead soldiers that line the battlefield. Roll twice on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Collapsing Roof

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP); DC 15/14 **Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour) A thin wire sits 3 feet off the ground,

connected to a structure that holds up a weak portion of a ceiling. When something trips the wire, that structure falls and the ceiling on top of it collapses.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 14 or with a Perception check to notice the construction. If the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

Only one check is needed to circumvent this challenge. Rolling or sliding an object heavy enough (30 pounds or more) to trip the wire will cause the roof to collapse safely.

Alternatively, an Engineering check can be made to prop up the ceiling or a thieves� tools check to disarm the trap.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers trigger the trap, causing the ceiling to collapse.

Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. Failure on the saving throw also causes a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The adventurers trigger the trap, causing the ceiling to collapse. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

**Success.** The trap is avoided or disarmed.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers avoid or disarm the trap but have the option to leave the trap active for someone else to deal with.

### Corrupted Druid Grove

*4th tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 17 (18,000 XP); DC 21/17

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A clearing of fetid, rotting plant life festers after the archdruid in charge of maintaining it was murdered in cold blood. Corrupted by this violent act of betrayal, the grove itself lashes out at living travelers who dare pass through.

**History.** An adventurer can make a History check to recall the story of the archdruid�s murder.

**Stubborn Nature.** Magic that influences plants and animals, such as the spell entangle, has a 50% chance of not functioning in this grove.

**Vulnerable to Magical Fire.** When an adventurer casts a spell or uses another magical effect that deals fire damage against the grove they gain an expertise die on their next ability check against it.

#### Possible Solutions

There are several ways to deal with this challenge. The party can make a group

Stealth check to traverse the grove without being discovered. Alternatively, an adventurer can make a DC 20 Arcana check to discover a way to spend an hour calming the grove which allows the whole group to traverse it safely. Finally, a Nature check can discover a way to purify the grove permanently; this process takes a full day but grants double the experience award.

**Critical Failure.** The grove lashes out at the party, sending 4 (1d4 + 2) treants to kill them. Each adventurer loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply while escaping, or 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply in the fight against the towering plants.

**Failure.** The party loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply trying to escape or sneak around the treants and each adventurer suffers one level of fatigue.

**Success.** The adventurers exit the grove unscathed.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers travel through the grove unhindered and for the next 10 (2d6 + 3) days a friendly shambling mound follows them in hopes that it can exact revenge on the archdruid�s murderer. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Counterfeit Goods

*0th tier (circumstance)* **Challenge** 2 (450 XP); DC 14/13 **Area** Region (special)

While resting at a haven or at some point along the journey, the adventurers discover they have acquired counterfeit goods!

Though the items initially appear to be fully functional, they are either very poorly crafted and made from inadequate materials prone to break, or simply appear to be the items in question but are no better than stage props. These could have been purchased or received as a quest reward.

The party has a few options: find the person who slighted them or ignore it and move on.

**Bad Goods.** The items are damaged and become broken after the first time they are used.

#### Possible Solutions

This challenge requires that the party and the vendor are still in the same region. A group Survival check can be made to follow the trail of the merchant who gave the adventurers the goods in the first place.

Alternatively, an adventurer may make a Deception check to sell the counterfeit goods to someone else, then use that money to replace them with genuine items.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses a day searching for the person that cheated them. Each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Failure.** The party loses half a day searching and each adventurer loses 1 Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers catch up with the dishonest vendor after 1d6 hours and with an Intimidation check may replace the counterfeit goods.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers not only catch up with the vendor after 1d4 hours and replace their goods, it turns out that the replacements are of a higher quality level than they�ve paid for (standard items become fine, and fine items become masterwork).

### Cursed Temple

*2nd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A circle of standing stones was constructed eons ago to worship a dark god and its evil still permeates the surrounding lands. At night bats can be heard � but never seen � flapping overhead. A nagging dread pervades the area, and those with access to divine magic receive a premonition that great evil will spread if this curse is not lifted.

**Bones.** A Medicine or Survival check finds the bones of several small animals scattered around the stones. Removing or burying these bones grants advantage on further checks against this exploration challenge.

**Dreaded Curse.** Attack rolls and saving throws made within a 600-foot radius of the standing stones have disadvantage. Anyone under the effects of protection from evil and good is immune to the Dreaded Curse.

#### Possible Solutions

A Religion check and a ritual performed for a good-aligned god permanently breaks the curse, as does a casting of the *hallow* spell. Alternatively, an Athletics check can topple the standing stones, breaking the circle and ending the curse � though not without a greater cost than some physical effort and sweat. Each adventurer within 100 feet of the stones makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) force damage and suffering one level of fatigue on a failure.

**Critical Failure.** The cursed area expands and becomes more aggressive, dragging down the very limbs of travelers. While within 3 miles of the standings stones, every mile traveled requires 4 miles worth of travel time. The party discovers that 7 (2d4 + 2) Supply from each adventurer has spoiled, and everyone suffers one level of strife.

**Failure.** When they leave the area, the party discovers that 6 (2d4 + 1) Supply from each adventurer has spoiled.

**Success.** The curse is lifted, rendering the circle of standing stones creepy but harmless.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers receive a divine blessing, granting them an item or discovery relevant to their quest. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Cursed Waterway

*3rd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

The lake, river, or other waterway ahead of the party bubbles with obviously sinister energy. Malevolent magic has plagued this place for far too long, cursing the water � those who touch it are made to carry the fell magic so great care must be taken when

traversing it. The nature of the curse is determined by the Narrator and functions as a *bestow curse* spell cast at 6th-level.

***Magical Effect.*** The cursed waterway is a magical effect created through necromancy magic. Using *dispel magic* on the waterway to suppress its enchantment for 1 hour requires a DC 22 spellcasting ability check.

**Lore.** An Arcana or Nature check can identify the origin and effects of the curse.

**Research.** Make an Arcana or Nature check to find a means of permanently dispelling the curse by undertaking research that requires 7 (1d6 + 4) days. The waterway�s curse can be dispelled with considerable time and effort. This usually involves fighting a powerful creature involved with the original cursing (such as a hag or even lich), or by gathering a large group of clerics or druids to purify the area through the use of the *hallow* spell or similar magic.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Acrobatics check allows the party to successfully avoid the bubbling water while traversing the waterway.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers fall into the waterway and are cursed until the curses are removed. In addition, each adventurer loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply.

**Failure.** An adventurer touches the water in some way becomes cursed for 7 (2d4 +2) days, and each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers lose 2 hours of travel time traversing the cursed waterway.

**Critical Success.** The cursed waterway doesn�t delay the adventurers at all, and they discover a clue for removing the curse (if they did not learn that already). Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Dark Alleys

*1st tier (urban)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); **DC** 14/13

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Shadows seem to cling to every corner, eyes stare from behind hidden barriers, innocents scurry away from the light � petty crime is the method of survival here, and anyone unable to adapt or blend in will suffer for it. The party needs to traverse this area of the city in order to reach their destination but it seems that no matter where they turn that eyes are watching them from the shadows, equal parts inquisitive and fearful.

#### Possible Solutions

A group check is needed to make it through this district. The adventurers may each use any reasonable ability check. Examples include Deception to use simple disguises and body language to pass as tough locals, Intimidation to give off a demeanor threatening enough to get others to mind their own business, or Stealth to move from shadow to shadow.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers are hassled by a guard squad, a gang of 6 criminals (bandits or thugs depending on the locale) confront the party, or their identities and location are leaked to their enemies.

**Failure.** Between youthful pickpockets, brazen brutes, and charming passersby each of the adventurers has their coin purses lightened, losing half of their gold (maximum 100 gold).

**Success.** The adventurers pass themselves off as if they belong and travel through unhindered.

**Critical Success.** Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table. Alternatively, the adventurers acquire a reliable connection to a local NPC.

### Dense Fog

*2nd tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Thick fog blankets the area. It�s possible the fog originates from smoke, descended clouds, volcanic ash, or other natural events.

**Causes.** If the fog is not natural, an Investigation check finds the origin of the haze, though it still needs to be plugged, put out, or otherwise stopped.

**Fogged Vision.** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 5 feet. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

**Spell Solve.** The fog can be temporarily blown away by the casting of a gust of wind spell, giving the adventurers advantage on checks made against it.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Survival check helps the party navigate through the fog. Alternatively, individual adventurers may choose to use Perception and scent, sound, or tremors to navigate.

**Critical Failure.** The party gets terribly lost, losing 8 (2d4 + 3) hours of travel time, and one adventurer suffers a level of fatigue when they take a hurtful fall in the fog.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose 4 (2d4 � 1) hours in the fog.

**Success.** The adventurers find pockets of clear sight within the haze and lose no travel time.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers travel unhindered through the area of haze and manage to find a faster route that lets them cover the area in just 1 hour.

#### Leave It Be

The haze may lift after 2d12 hours. The choice to wait or venture forth into the obscured area is in the hands of the adventurers. If they wait, they lose that amount of time and gain no experience.

### Divine War

*4th tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 20 (25,000 XP); DC 23/18

**Area** Region (time varies)

The skies rain blood and bolts of necrotic lightning strike the earth as celestials and

fiends clash overhead in a battle of truly epic proportions, filling the sky with divine violence. Swarms of angels trace blinding radiance as demons and devils spout hellish flames in pursuit, and for every lance of pure light cast down onto the conflict from the clouds above there is a swarm of darkness that rises up to consume it.

**Divine Interventions.** Every hour the effect of so many extraplanar beings unleashing their power in such close proximity has an unintended impact that falls upon the party. Each adventurer rolls 1d20, and whoever has the lowest roll becomes the target of this effect. When there is a tie, the point in space between the two is targeted instead. Roll 1d8 and refer to the Divine Interventions table.

Creatures with the Good alignment trait have advantage on saving throws against celestial Divine Interventions, and creatures with the Evil alignment trait have advantage on saving throws against fiendish Divine Interventions.

**Magical Effects.** Divine interventions are magical effects. Using *dispel magic* on the effects of a Divine Intervention requires a spellcasting ability check. On a failed check, the spellcaster becomes a target of another Divine Intervention the next round.

**Realize Danger.** Any adventurer that makes an Arcana or Religion check realizes the less obvious dangers of being so close to this conflict and how the clash of divine forces manifests strange effects on the environment nearby.

#### Possible Solutions

There is no easy way to get through this challenge. The PCs must simply push through and suffer the effects of the Divine Interventions; there is no way to end the war. They might choose to join the fray (on either side) and powerful magic such as wish can delay the battle long enough for them to leave the region. With a Persuasion check to convince a squad of celestials or fiends that the party is neutral to the conflict, the adventurers receive either an angelic blessing or hellish enchantment, gaining an

expertise die on saving throws against the exploration challenge�s Divine Interventions.

##### TABLE: DIVINE INTERVENTIONS 1D8 EFFECT TYPE EFFECT

***Blood Rain.*** Crimson rain laced with negative energy falls in a 60-foot radius around the target. Each creature in the area makes a Constitution

1. Fiendish
2. Fiendish
3. Fiendish
4. Celestial
5. Celestial
6. Celestial
7. Either

saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) necrotic damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply as provisions melt into into moldy slop and water turns into sewage.

***The Fallen.*** The blazing corpse of a slain celestial plummets to the ground landing in a square adjacent to the target. Each creature in a 40-foot radius makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire

damage and 35 (10d6) radiant damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw. The explosive inferno damages objects in the area and ignites unattended flammable objects.

***Harmful Blast.*** A virulent disease is released on the target and they make a Constitution saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) necrotic damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. In addition, a target that fails the saving throw reduces its hit point maximum by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This damage can�t reduce the target�s hit points below 1. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

***Restorative Ray.*** A surge of positive energy washes through the target and they regain 70 hit points. In addition, the ray cures a target of the blinded and deafened conditions as well as any disease affecting it.

***Stunning Utterance.*** The target clearly hears the unfiltered song of a celestial�s rage, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned until the end of its next turn and rattled for the following hour. If the target has more than 150 hit points, it is instead rattled for the next hour instead. At the end of every minute, a rattled target makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Sunburst.*** Brilliant sunlight flashes down from the heavens in a 60-foot radius around the target. Each creature in the area makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure a creature takes 42 (12d6) radiant damage and is blinded for 1 hour, or on a success it takes half as much damage and isn�t blinded. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of every 10 minutes, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Lethal Utterance.*** The target clearly hears either a fiend utter a prayer or a celestial scream a curse. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer it dies, or if it has more than 100 hit points it takes 50 hit points of damage.

1. Either

***Exsanguinated Horror.*** Two of the divine combatants from above swoop down amidst a furious duel, soaring past the target. Creatures able to see witness the unfiltered purity and depravity of celestials and fiends sliced open in a gruesome display. Each creature in a 30-foot radius (including the target) makes a Wisdom saving throw, becoming frightened for 1 minute on a failure. At the end of every round a frightened creature repeats the saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failure or ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Enchanted Statue

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

When a pressure plate concealed on the ground registers 20 or more pounds of weight, a nearby statue expels fire from an orifice (such as a mouth or nostrils) or a spellcasting focus (such as a wand or staff).

***Magical Effect.*** The statue has a magical effect created through evocation magic, though its aura requires a passive Perception of 14 to be seen while under the effects of detect magic. Using *dispel magic* on the statue to suppress its enchantment for 24 hours requires a spellcasting ability check.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a

(4d12) fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. All flammable objects that are unattended are lit on fire.

**Failure.** The adventurers trigger the trap and a 30-foot cone of flame washes over them. Creatures in the area make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (2d12) fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. All flammable objects that are unattended are lit on fire.

**Success.** The adventurers avoid or disarm the trap, or activate it from a safe distance.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers avoid or disarm the trap but have the option to leave the trap active for someone else to deal with.

##### TABLE: ELEMENTAL STATUES DAMAG

statues need to breathe fire! Because this trap is magical, it can deal most types of magical damage instead of fire. Use the Elemental Statues table for alternate damage types and the extra effects of an elemental statue.

#### Possible Solutions

An adventurer can make a Dexterity check to wedge a dagger beneath the pressure plate or a thieves� tools check to disarm the pressure plate before triggering it.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers trigger the trap and a 45-foot cone of flame washes over them. Creatures in the area make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 26

Acid Dexterity

Cold Dexterity

Lightning Dexterity

reveals that the sounds of the giant�s swings don�t perfectly align with its movements. If at any point they figure out that this is a windmill and make it inside, roll twice on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Endless Plummet

*3rd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP); DC 19/16

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

Thunder Constitution Knocked prone on a

failed saving throw.

### Enchanted Windmill

*0th tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A mechanically-minded wizard built a windmill to power her experiments � she has long since moved on, but the illusion disguising the windmill as a massive giant swinging a club remains atop a high hill with a commanding view of the area for miles around.

**Attack!** Ranged attacks against the giant have no effect as they appear to bounce harmlessly off the swinging club. A melee weapon attack allows an adventurer to see through the illusion, but they damage their weapon and suffer a level of fatigue from swinging directly into a stone wall.

**Magical Effect.** The figment of a giant is a magical effect created through illusion magic. Using *dispel magic* on the figment requires a spellcasting ability check.

Successfully dispelling this challenge earns double experience.

**Mindless Figment.** Intimidation and Performance checks to draw the giant�s attention have no effect.

#### Possible Solutions

As this is only an illusion, the adventurers can walk safely past, but this is only realized after a successful Perception check, which

An enormous and seemingly infinitely deep pit sits in the center of the ground. Any who fall into it plummet forever thanks to the transmutation magic that keeps it working, and those who peer too closely find the strange enchantment also perilously hampers balance.

**Dangerous Darkness.** The darkness of the pit�s illusion makes it impossible for creatures further than 10 feet from its edge to see anything inside of it, though sounds from within the pit can easily be heard from further away. Any Investigation or Perception checks made against the pit require being within 10 feet of the edge.

**Sneaky Compulsion.** A creature that looks into the pit from within 10 feet of the edge must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or it loses its balance, suddenly stumbling forward and falling inside!

**Spell Solve.** Using *dispel magic* on the pit to suppress its enchantment for 1 hour requires a spellcasting ability check. An adventurer that falls into the real pit travels 100 feet to its true bottom where there is a 10% chance they find an entrance to Underland. Successfully dispelling this exploration challenge triggers a critical success.

#### Possible Solutions

The pit is a magical effect created through illusion and transmutation magic, but it requires sight. A clever party can cover or shut their eyes, making a group Intelligence check to keep their bearing and walk near the pit�s edge without being compelled by it.

Once an adventurer has fallen inside the pit, they can make an Arcana check to identify a weak point in the illusion that helps them escape, or an Athletics check to grab onto something real and climb out of the pit.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers fall until the magic is dispelled or someone passing by helps them get out after 2 (1d4) days. Each adventurer loses 8 (2d6

+ 1) Supply, and suffers a level of fatigue and strife for every day spent falling.

**Failure.** The adventurer falls, losing 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply and suffering one level of strife before either the magic is dispelled or someone helps them get out.

**Success.** The adventurers lose negligible time navigating the pit.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers lose negligible time navigating the pit. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### End of Hibernation

*0th tier (creatures)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Region (time varies)

A season is coming to an end and hibernating animals are starting to wake up in their caves or crawl up from their holes. This area is typically safe to travel, but the hibernating animals are a mixed bag of restless, groggy, and hungry. Bears in particular are lethal yet still dazed from their winter naps, so it should be possible to get past without disturbing them � get on their nerves too much and it could be fatal.

**Food Bribery.** The party can give away a number of Supply equal to the number of adventurers to befriend, distract, and sate the hunger of the waking creatures long enough to make their way past, gaining advantage on checks made to influence the beasts.

#### Possible Solutions

Either a group Animal Handling check to demonstrate peaceful intent to the animals or a group Stealth check to sneak past the animals.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers disturb the hibernating animals and are pursued by 3 (1d4 + 1) black bears (or other beasts of CR 1/2 or lower).

**Failure.** The adventurers disturb the hibernating animals and are pursued by a black bear (or other beast of CR 1/2 or lower).

**Success.** The adventurers successfully pass through the animals� territory without incident.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers pass through the animals� territory without incident. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Faerie Ring

*2nd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

While traveling down a track crowded on either side by near-impenetrable woodlands, the party comes across a clearing with a mushroom ring of tall and brightly red-capped fungi that blocks their way. Being in sight of the mushroom ring causes strange hallucinations of gnomes peeking around trees, which end when an adventurer steps into the mushroom ring. In addition to ending the hallucination, the adventurer feels extreme peace � and the urge to recite a riddle they have never heard before, which if answered correctly causes a powerful enchantment to spread through the area.

**Investigation.** An Investigation check reveals that the hallucinations are harmless.

**Lore.** An Arcana check determines that this is the work of mischievous fey.

**Magical Aura.** Observing the mushroom ring while under the effects of detect magic reveals an aura of divination magic.

#### Possible Solutions

The adventurers have three attempts to answer the riddle posed by the faerie ring. Answering correctly on the first try is a critical success, and on the second or third

try a success; otherwise a failure is triggered. Alternatively, a group Acrobatics check allows the party to carefully step over all of the many fungi making up the mushroom ring, risking a critical failure, but they gain no experience from the exploration challenge.

**Critical Failure.** When the mushroom ring is damaged each of the adventurers immediately suffer one level of strife as a sense of dread spreads from it. As they continue on, the hallucinations become just tangible enough to mercilessly tickle them and each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** Going far enough from the ring for the hallucinated gnomes not to follow requires half a day of travel time.

**Success.** The area around the mushroom ring is turned into a haven for the next 24 hours.

**Critical Success.** As a success, and when the party awakens they find a delicious breakfast waiting for them.

*0th tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); DC 13/13

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A hunter has set up and left a net trap to catch some massive creature in this prime hunting spot. The height and dimensions of the net are at the Narrator�s discretion, but should be big enough to capture at least a Large creature. Several thin wires sit 3 feet off the ground, each connected to a structure that holds up the net. When something trips the wire, the net drops down around it.

1. not throw? .

**Item.** The net is made of a tough

material (AC 16, 20 hit points) and needs to be cut in at least four places no less

than 1 foot apart for a trapped creature to free itself.

**Escape.** If the adventurers are caught in the trap, an Athletics check allows them to free themselves, and an Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand check enables them to wiggle a blade free.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 14 or with a Perception check to notice ropes overhead. If the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

Once the adventurers notice the trap, an Investigation check disables it. They might instead make Acrobatics checks to carefully move around the wires, or Athletics checks to climb on any objects or structures nearby (if there are any) to avoid touching the ground entirely.

***Critical Failure.*** The entire party is caught by the net and suspended 20 feet in the air. Each of the adventurers is grappled and restrained. If they are unable to escape, a hunter comes by in two days and frees them.

***Failure.*** The adventurer that failed the check is caught by the net and suspended 20 feet in the air, grappled and restrained by it. Safely freeing them takes 2 hours (though they can be freed more quickly if the net is dropped 20 feet to the ground first).

***Success.*** The party spots and avoids the trap.

***Critical Success.*** The party disassembles the trap and gains a tough net as well as 250 feet of hemp rope.

### Fey Glade

*3rd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Special

The glade seems to go on forever and ever � because it does! A prankster fey has enchanted this place to make it seem as if it can never be left.

**Lore.** An Arcana check allows an adventurer to recognize the fey influence.

**Magical Effect.** The fey glade is a magical effect created through illusion magic. Using *dispel magic* on the glade to suppress its enchantment for 8 hours requires a spellcasting ability check.

#### Possible Solutions

The party can make a group Survival check to navigate the glade despite the illusion magic.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers lose 3 (1d4 + 1) days of travel. Each wakes up the next morning with their most

brightly-colored non-iron object missing.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose a full day of travel time. Each wakes up the next morning with their most brightly-colored non-iron object missing

**Success.** The adventurers successfully navigate the glade.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers keep fond memories of traveling through the glade. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Flash Flood

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

While journeying through a valley or canyon that appears to have recently burned, a rumbling comes from up ahead and soon after the spray of water � a flash flood!

**Don�t Run!** Nature or Survival checks reveal that outrunning a flash flood is impossible and that the best solution is to climb to safety. Those who try to run automatically fail the group check.

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, *rope trick*, or similar magic triggers an automatic success for that adventurer.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Athletics check allows the party to climb to safety. An adventurer with a climb speed automatically succeeds in this check.

**Critical Failure.** Adventurers, mounts, and vehicles in the area when it floods are carried 260 (2d12 � 20) feet away.

Each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue and the party loses 7 (2d4 + 2) Supply.

**Failure.** Adventurers, mounts, and vehicles in the area when it floods are carried 260 (2d12 � 20) feet away. Any adventurer that is carried away suffers a level of fatigue and loses 3 (1d4) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurer reaches safety.

**Critical Success.** The party reaches safety. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Flimsy Rope Bridge

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP); DC 17/15

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A ravine ahead can only be traversed via a narrow bridge made from knotted ropes. It sways in the wind and looks unstable. When the adventurers are halfway across the bridge, the ropes snap if a Medium or larger creature steps on them.

**Fly Away.** The use of *fly* or similar magic (except *levitate*) triggers a critical success for that adventurer.

**Realize Danger.** Any adventurer that makes an Engineering or Investigation check identifies some places that the bridge could be strengthened, including the weak point in the middle.

#### Possible Solutions

Making it across the bridge requires a group Acrobatics check.

*Critical Failure.* The bridge suddenly breaks and the party has to scramble or be dropped into the ravine! Each adventurer makes a Dexterity saving throw to grab and hold onto the rope as they swing down into the sides of the ravine, taking 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage from the impact. Any adventurers ahead of the break fall towards the far end of the bridge, and those behind the break fall back towards the bridge�s start.

On a failed save, an adventurer falls 100 feet down into the ravine, taking 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage when they land. Climbing back out requires a

successful Athletics check, with advantage if a rope is thrown down.

**Failure.** The bridge breaks as above, but the adventurers have 1 round to react after the process starts and advantage on their Dexterity saving throw to grip the rope. Grabbing both sides and holding the bridge together requires a Strength check at the end of each round.

**Success.** The adventurers safely make it across the rope bridge.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers safely make it across the rope bridge and notice something important while doing so. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Flood

*1st tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Heavy rains, a dam breakage, or a spiteful spellcaster have caused a sizable flood.

While there isn�t significant risk of building damage in rural or frontier areas, the flood is difficult to travel through especially for travelers with mounts or vehicles.

**Deep Water.** The adventurers can only travel at a crawl pace unless they have swim speeds.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Athletics check is needed to wade through the water. Alternatively, an Engineering check (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) can build a raft or other floating device at the cost of 1 hour and 1d4 gold worth of materials.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers are unable to continue and must remain where they are until the flood passes in 2 (1d4) hours.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose 6 (2d4 + 1) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers are able to journey through the flood at a slow pace.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers faultlessly navigate the flood unhindered. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Forested Hills

*0th tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); DC 13/13

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Lush woodland foliage covers leagues of stoney hills and valleys. The tree canopy splays rays of sun. Careful steps are needed to scramble around loose

moss-covered stones and exposed roots.

**Ascending.** The steep hills are treated as difficult terrain when moving up them.

**Animal Tracks.** A successful Perception or Survival check spots animal paths through the hills that make them easier to traverse, enabling the party to move at normal pace.

**Opportunistic Shoves.** An attacker can choose to make attack rolls with disadvantage to include a shove basic maneuver. A target that fails its saving throw falls 100 feet down into the hillsides, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage when they come to a stop.

**The High Ground.** Ranged attacks made against targets downhill from an attacker have advantage.

#### Possible Solutions

Traveling through the steep hills requires a group Athletics check.

**Critical Failure.** The series of hills are deceptively dangerous. The adventurers each lose 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply and suffer a level of fatigue.

**Failure*.*** The adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply as they scramble amongst the hills.

**Success.** The adventurers navigate a safe and speedy path over the hills and vales.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers spot something of import tucked in a tree trunk or small dale amongst the hilly woods.

Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Forest Fire

*4th tier (circumstance)*

**Challenge** 19 (22,000 XP); DC 22/17

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

An errant spark or bit of fire quickly grows and before the party realizes it they are surrounded on all sides by a conflagration! Hungry flames wreathe through the treetops as winds fuel the rapidly increasing inferno, singeing everything with scorching heat.

Wild animals run for cover in a panic, blinded by choking smoke.

**Clear Spots.** An Investigation check can find an area free of fire and smoke to get re-oriented and gain an expertise die on ability checks made against this exploration challenge.

**Face Coverings.** The use of 1 Supply worth of water adequately wets a cloth or face-covering for 1 hour, granting a creature wearing it advantage on Constitution saving throws against the Choking Smoke and Inescapable Heat hazards.

**Fogged Vision.** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 30 feet. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

**Hazards.** At the end of every hour in the area, roll 1d6 on the Forest Fire Hazards table.

**Spell Solve.** A casting of *control weather* abates the effects of the flames, and the adventurers gain an expertise die on saving throws made against Choking Smoke and Inescapable Heat.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Survival check is needed to navigate through the smoke.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers take twice as long to traverse the area, and each suffers a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The adventurers make it through the forest fire in twice the normal time.

**Success.** The adventurers make it through the forest at normal speed.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers make it through the forest and they spot something important. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

##### TABLE. FOREST FIRE HAZARDS 1D6 HAZARD EFFECT

Creatures must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage. A creature that is immune to poison damage or does not need to breathe

1�2 Choking Smoke

Inescapable

automatically succeeds on this save. Any creature that takes a 40 or more poison damage from the smoke becomes poisoned, and a poisoned creature that fails its saving throw suffers one level of fatigue. On a critical failure, a poisoned creature falls unconscious for 60 (1d12 � 10) minutes.

Creatures must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage

3�4

5�6

Heat

Panicked Animals

and suffer a level of fatigue. Immunity to fire damage grants an automatic success on this save.

Fleeing beasts won�t engage in combat but that doesn�t mean they aren�t still dangerous. Adventurers make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage, lose 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply, and suffer a level of fatigue.

### Forge, Foundry, and Factory

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area Immediate** (less than 1 hour)

While moving through the town, the road ends at a massive foundry the size of a city block. Massive piles of unprocessed ore fill nearly every corner of this foundry and it is in full working order � molten buckets of alloys move overhead, conveyor belts carry stone and metals throughout, and ovens hot as the sun belch fire and blistering waves of heat.

**Unbearable Heat.** Adventurers and mounts wearing medium or heavy armor make a Constitution saving throw or suffer a level of fatigue. Immunity to fire damage grants an automatic success on this save.

#### Possible Solutions

A group check is needed to traverse the factory. Adventurers can choose from Acrobatics to weave around the factory floor, Engineering to deduce the factory�s layout and the most efficient routes to take,

and Intimidation or Persuasion to hastily convince workers to make way.

**Critical Failure.** It takes the party 4 (1d4

+ 2) minutes to make it through the factory. Each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue from a workplace mishap and loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Failure.** It takes the party 2 (1d4) minutes to make it through the factory, they lose 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply, and any adventurer that failed their check suffers a level of fatigue.

**Success.** It takes the adventurers 1 minute to make it through the factory.

**Critical Success.** It takes the party 1 minute to make it through the factory, and they either overhear about something or spot something of import. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

The adventurers can backtrack and find another route, which takes them an hour and earns no experience.

### God Corpse

*4th tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 17 (18,000 XP); DC 21/17

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour) The skyline is broken by the massive,

jagged silhouette of an impossibly enormous humanoid�s ribcage. A shattered skull and massive femurs are embedded into the ground around it. Those with access to divine magic sense that some kind of action is needed.

**Aligned Casting.** When a spellcaster with the same alignment trait as the dead god casts a spell, roll 1d4. On a 1 the spell functions as intended, although with some harmless or unusual cosmetic effect. On a 2�3, the spell is absorbed into the corpse of the god. On a 4, the spell�s mechanical effects (hit points restored, damage dealt, or bonuses to attacks, checks, and saving throws) are doubled and the ground shakes with the remembrance of divine potency.

**Alignment.** Roll a d6 to determine the dead god�s alignment trait. On a 1�2 the god was Evil, on a 3�4 the god was neither Good nor Evil, and on a 5�6 the god was Good.

**Cause of Death.** An Arcana or Medicine check reveals the means of death. Roll 1d4. 1 � another god, 2 � adventurers who perished in the battle, 3 � a powerful non-god entity, 4 � something outside mortal knowledge entirely.

**Domain.** Roll a d8 to determine the domain of the god before it fell. 1 � knowledge, 2 � life, 3 � light, 4 �

nature, 5 � tempest, 6 � trickery, 7 � war, 8 � roll twice (ignoring duplicates).

**Locus of Power.** God corpses frequently draw out or errantly beckon certain creatures of up to challenge rating

10. What creatures appear near the god corpse are determined by its alignment. evil � fiends or undead, neutral � aberrations or fey, good � celestials or plants.

**Nearby Shrine.** An adventurer can make a History check to know of a shrine to the god within 7 (2d6) hours of travel. Making an offering of 1,000 gold at the shrine grants all participants in the ritual an expertise die on checks made involving the god corpse.

#### Possible Solutions

A Religion check reveals that this is the corpse of a god, as well as its domain and alignment. The check also reveals to the adventurers that they need to put the god to final rest. A group Religion check can give the corpse peace by enacting appropriate rituals lasting for a day.

**Critical Failure.** All adventurers suffer two levels of strife. For the next 5 (2d4) days, each of the adventurers subtracts a d4 whenever they make an attack roll or saving throw.

**Failure.** The adventurers fail to enact the ritual, and each suffer one level of strife.

**Success.** The god is put to rest. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

**Critical Success.** The gods are pleased. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table. Additionally, the next time each is reduced to 0 hit points, they are immediately restored to their hit point maximum.

#### Leave It Be

If the party abandons the god to its fate their disregard offends its lingering essence, triggering a Critical Failure.

### Green Lake

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

The lake ahead is an eerie and unnatural green, and when gazed upon in the night it glows. Algae has turned the water this color and the fish living within it have adapted to have no eyes.

**Dangerous Algae.** A Nature check identifies the type of algae as a poisonous variety, making the lake water dangerous to touch. Deliberately drinking or trying to swim across the lake triggers a Critical Failure.

**Harvesting.** A Medicine check reveals that the algae can be dried out, at which point it is no longer poisonous and can be

used as a clotting agent (functioning as an improvised bandage).

#### Possible Solutions

The party can make a group Athletics or water vehicle check to cross the lake by boat or raft. At least one adventurer must be making a water vehicle check; otherwise all Athletics checks have disadvantage. If they do not have a water vehicle, one adventurer can spend 3 hours to build a raft with an Engineering check.

**Critical Failure.** The boat capsizes and the party is plunged into the green water, losing half their Supply. They each gain a level of fatigue, and are poisoned until they take a long rest.

**Failure.** The adventurers boat across, but they encounter a mishap, losing 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers follow their route and cross the lake unhindered.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers harvest useful things from the lake, gaining one use of a healer�s satchel and 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

#### Leave It Be

Bypassing the suspicious lake is possible but takes a while � safely traveling around it costs an extra day of travel time. No experience is awarded to the party.

### Hail Deluge

*2nd tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); DC 17/15

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Suddenly the sky rains down with chunks of ice the size of a warrior�s fist that pummel away at anything left out in the open.

#### Possible Solutions

The adventurers can make a group Constitution check to tough out the storm or a Survival check to find a safe place to wait out the storm (losing half a day of travel).

**Critical Failure.** The party is pelted by the hail, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage at the end of every hour they

travel. Each adventurer also suffers one level of fatigue and travel time is doubled through the storm�s area.

**Failure.** The adventurers are pelted by the hail, each taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and suffering one level of fatigue.

**Success.** The adventurers successfully avoid being damaged by the storm.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers successfully avoid the storm and also discover a hailstone infused with magic (worth 42 gold). Any spellcaster holding it can use a bonus action to draw power from the hailstone, regaining one 1st-level spell slot.

### Hail Storm

*0th tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); DC 13/13

**Area** Region (time varies)

Giant lumps of ice and other particles are falling from the sky, making travel slower and more dangerous. It might be better to wait this one out, but finding shelter in this weather is also difficult.

#### Possible Solutions

The party can make a group Constitution check to tough out the storm. A Survival check enables them to find a safe place to wait out the storm, but they lose a full day of travel.

**Critical Failure.** The party is pelted by the hail, taking 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage at the end of every hour they travel. Each adventurer also suffers one level of fatigue and travel time is doubled through the storm�s area.

**Failure.** The adventurers are pelted by the hail, each suffering one level of fatigue.

**Success.** The adventurers successfully avoid being damaged by the storm.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers successfully avoid the storm and also discover something useful as they fight through the dangerous weather. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Hallowed Ground

*4th tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 16 (15,000 XP); DC 21/17

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

The will of the gods will not be ignored, and it is divine will that travelers pass with great difficulty or not at all. Perhaps someone in the party has angered a god or spirit, or a deity is conspiring with one of their enemies. Travel in this place feels slow and sluggish, as though the land itself is rejecting trespassers.

**Appeasement.** A Religion check reveals a way to appease the god and ensure safe passage. Roll 1d6 to determine what is required. 1�2 an offering of 250 gold, 3�4 an offering of 10 (2d6 + 3) Supply, 5�6 a willingly accepted geas to perform some service for the god.

#### Possible Solutions

The adventurers can make a group Survival check to tough it out and force their way through.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses two days of travel and each adventurer suffers two levels of strife. Acolytes and followers of the deity recognize the party and are hostile to them for the next month.

**Failure.** The party loses two full days of travel and each adventurer suffers one level of strife.

**Success.** The party successfully crosses the area.

**Critical Success.** The party�s determination wins the favor of the god, and for the next 3 (1d6) days each adventurer gains an expertise die on attack rolls and saving throws.

### Haze

*0th tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 1/4 (50 XP); DC 12/10

**Area** Local (1 hour)

A thin fog blankets the area. It�s possible the haze originates from smoke, low-lying clouds, or other natural events.

**Hazy Vision.** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 60 feet. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

**Spell Solve.** The haze can be temporarily blown away by the casting of a gust of wind spell, giving the adventurers advantage on checks made against it.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Survival check allows the party to navigate the haze.

**Critical Failure.** The party gets terribly lost, losing 4 (1d4 + 2) hours of travel time, and one adventurer suffers a level of fatigue when the haze causes them to take a hurtful fall.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose 2 (1d4) hours in the haze.

**Success.** The adventurers find pockets of clear sight within the haze and move through the haze at normal speed.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers travel unhindered through the area of haze and uncover one tier 0 Boon or Discovery.

### Hellscape

*4th tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 18 (20,000 XP); DC 22/17

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Gouts of flame and choking gases spew forth from the ground as rivers of molten lava flow beneath thin crusts of blackened stone.

**Hellstrikes.** Once every hour, the Narrator rolls 1d4 for each member of the party to see if they run into a hazard in this terrain, and on a result of 4, roll 1d6 and refer to Table. Hellstrikes to determine what assails them.

#### Possible Solutions

The adventurers need to tough this one out, bearing the brunt of the hellstrikes. They succeed by making it across the area alive. A few different types of checks can help:

* An Engineering check determines which areas ahead are the most dangerous to walk upon. The Narrator rolls 1d8 for the adventurer when determining if they run into a hazard (instead of 1d4), and a Hellstrike only occurs on a result of 8.
* Perception check to be on the lookout for danger, granting advantage on one ally�s saving throw against a Hellstrike.
* Survival check to navigate towards safer routes through the area, granting an expertise die on saving throws made against Hellstrikes.

**Critical Failure.** For every Hellstrike that an adventurer makes a saving throw against, they lose 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Failure.** Each adventurer loses 1 Supply per Hellstrike.

**Success.** The adventurers persevere through the Hellstrikes and do not suffer any additional negative effects.

**Critical Success.** As a success, and roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

**TABLE: HELLSTRIKES 1D6 EFFECT**

***Scorching Blast.*** Jets of flame explode outward. The adventurer makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) poison damage on a

1. failure, or half damage on a success. Any flammable objects being worn or carried

by the adventurer catch on fire, dealing 3 (1d6) ongoing fire damage until the flames are extinguished with a DC 15 Dexterity check.

***Volcanic Ejecta.*** Magma pressure builds up until a jet of lava bursts up into the sky. The adventurer makes a Dexterity saving

1. throw. On a failure, the adventurer takes 27 (5d10) fire damage and 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage and is restrained. A restrained adventurer takes 16 (3d10)

ongoing fire damage until freed with a Strength check. The ongoing damage also ends if the cooling molten stone is destroyed (AC 17, 30 hit points, and immunity to fire damage).

***Poison Gas.*** The adventurer wanders into a cloud of invisible poison gas and makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 22 (4d10) poison damage and are unable to speak for 1 minute. On a

1. failure by 5 or more, the adventurer is

stunned for 2 (1d4) rounds and exposed to the poison gas at the start of each of their turns until they are at least 30 feet away from it.

***Lava Pit.*** The stone ground beneath suddenly cracks and gives way! The adventurer must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall into a pit of lava and take 55 (10d10) fire damage. While in the

1. lava pit the adventurer takes 55 (10d10) ongoing fire damage. Any creature that attempts to pull the adventurer out with a Strength check also makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) fire damage on a failure.

***Ashen Cloud.*** A thick cloud of ash and smoke erupts from cracks in the stone, filling a 500-foot radius around the adventurer with smog. The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 5 feet.

1. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores

(including passive Perception) are reduced by 5. The adventurer or their companions require a Survival check to regroup, losing 2 (1d4) hours of travel time for each failed attempt.

***Shifting Earth.*** The ground below tilts and slides. The adventurer makes a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failure.

Getting up from prone and moving to a solid area requires an Acrobatics check.

1. On a failure by 5 or more on either the saving throw or ability check, the adventurer�s hands punch through the crust of stone into the lava beneath, and they take 33 (6d10) fire damage and suffer a level of fatigue.

### Hoar Frost

*3rd tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 15 (13,000 XP); DC 20/16

**Area** Region (time varies)

Lethal creeping cold pervades � deadly to warm flesh, covering objects in frost, instantly freezing even boiling water, and making the eyes sting as bodily fluids try to solidify into thin layers of ice.

**Fires.** Both mundane flame and arcane heat can stave off the building frost, but maintaining any fire requires constant vigilance with 2 (1d4) ongoing fire damage at the end of every 10 minutes (for flames kept alight with cantrips) or a Survival check once each hour.

**Frozen Solid.** Keeping one�s belongings relatively warm is paramount. Each day 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply becomes useless as it freezes solid � waterskins burst and leak when their contents melt and provisions crumble when thawed.

**Lethal Cold.** At the end of every hour in the area, creatures take 3 (1d6) cold damage. Wearing cold weather gear halves this cold damage (minimum 1). No short or long rests are possible in the cold. A creature reduced to 0 hit points can become stable, but only after it is wrapped in furs and blankets or placed adjacent to fire to protect it from the cold

� otherwise it continues to suffer from the cold while in the area, making additional death saves when dealt cold damage.

**Keep Moving.** To prevent frostbite an adventurer needs to keep moving, stay wrapped in warm garments, and expose as little flesh as possible. Any stationary objects become covered in thick layers of ice and freeze solid (this includes tents or spells that create solid surfaces.)

#### Possible Solutions

The party needs to make a group check to get through the region. Adventurers can choose from the following:

* Engineering checks to create improvisational structures that allow the party to safely stay warm.
* Medicine checks to treat frostbite. This may be necessary to prevent the loss of fingers and toes.
* Survival checks to locate shelter that will stay warm enough for safety.
* Constitution saving throws to simply power through.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses 2 (1d4) days of travel time and suffers one level of fatigue navigating through the area. In addition, a pocket of warm air from far above suddenly condenses and falls in a soaking slush, forcing each adventurer to make a Strength saving throw or be restrained as the liquid transforms into ice that encases their body. A restrained adventurer takes 16 (3d10) ongoing cold damage until they are freed with a Strength check. The ongoing damage also ends if the encasing ice is destroyed (AC 16, 20 hit points, and immunity to cold damage). Any adventurer that takes 30 or more cold damage suffers an additional level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose 1 day of travel time and suffer one level of fatigue navigating through the area.

**Success.** The adventurers manage to push through the area.

**Critical Success.** Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

A lethal poisonous cloud of gas that burns lungs and melts flesh flows out from fissures, an alchemist�s lair, or the pyroclasmic aftermath of a volcano to sweep over the area. Extraplanar explorers know that these are a particularly common threat when traveling in the lower realms,

sometimes covering entire regions in a miasma of flesh-eating death.

**Fogged Vision.** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 5 feet. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

**Poison Cloud.** At the end of every hour in the area or when exiting the killing cloud, a creature makes a Constitution saving throw or takes 45 (10d8) poison damage. A creature that is immune to poison damage or does not need to breathe automatically succeeds on this save. Any creature that takes 80 or more poison damage from the cloud becomes poisoned, and a poisoned creature that fails its saving throw suffers one level of fatigue. On a critical failure, a poisoned creature falls unconscious for 60 (1d12 � 10) minutes.

**Realize Danger.** Any adventurer that makes an Arcana or Nature check realizes the nature of the poison cloud and its effects.

**Spell Solve.** The fog can be temporarily blown away by the casting of a gust of wind spell or other wind-based magic that uses a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, giving the adventurers advantage on saving throws and checks made against it.

**Spoiled Supply.** The poison cloud ruins 1 Supply each hour, spoiling rations and contaminating water.

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, or similar magic is an automatic success in the group check for that adventurer.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Survival check is needed to navigate safely through the cloud.

**Critical Failure.** The party stumbles through the area, losing 7 (2d4 + 2) hours of travel time getting lost in the killing cloud. Adventurers suffer a level of fatigue for each time they fall unconscious in the killing cloud or take more than 100 poison damage from it.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose 3 (1d4 + 1) hours of travel navigating through the killing cloud.

**Success.** The adventurers navigate safely through the killing cloud.

**Critical Success.** As a success, and roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Labyrinthine Ravines

*1st tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); DC 13/13

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

The terrain on either side of the path rises higher and higher until the rock walls block out the light � suddenly there are several paths ahead and it�s confusing as to which is the right way forward.

**Mapping.** To map the ravines, roll 1d6 to determine what comes next. 1 � bends left, 2 � forks, 3 � T-junction, 4 � three-way split, 5 � circle linking back to somewhere the party has already been, 6

� bends right. Every roll represents 10 minutes of travel.

**Scout It Out.** An Athletics check lets an adventurer climb to the top of the canyon wall, allowing them to find their way out and trigger a success.

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, *rope trick*, or similar magic triggers an automatic success for that adventurer.

#### Possible Solutions

The adventurers may try to map the ravines, automatically succeeding if they do so out of character. Otherwise, a Survival check ensures an accurate map of where they have been, or a Nature check reveals that a little rivulet runs downhill and leads to an exit from the ravines.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers get hopelessly lost and only find their way out after 5 (1d4 + 3) days.

**Failure.** The party finds a way out, but it�s difficult. With all the turning about and backtracking they lose 6 (1d4 + 4) hours of travel time and each adventurer loses 5 (2d4 + 1) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers find their way out after 4 (1d4 + 2) hours.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers find their way out. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Landslide

*0th tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); DC 13/13

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

Recent rains or heavy snow has rendered a nearby slope quite perilous. A landslide is set off by any loud noise such as conversation, music, spellcasting, fleeing animals, the cracking of a fallen tree branch, thud of a rolling stone, or any substantial impacts on the ground.

Each adventurer must make a Strength saving throw. On a success, they are carried 2d12 yards down the slope; on a failure, they are carried twice that far and suffer a level of fatigue.

**Realize Danger.** Any adventurer that makes a Nature check recognizes that the ground or snow ahead is unstable, and that loud noises or rough impacts could trigger a landslide.

**Spell Solve.** Spells that produce water or heat can melt and refreeze a

snow-based landslide, while a spell that can shape earth can solidify an earthen landslide.

#### Possible Solutions

If the party realizes the danger of the landslide, a group check using Acrobatics or Stealth lets them pass without setting the landslide off. Making a group Athletics check allows the adventurers to cross after the landslide, but on a failure, they set off a second landslide. A Survival check finds animal tracks showing a safe way around the area.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses 4 (1d4

+ 2) Supply and each adventurer suffers one level of fatigue.

**Failure.** Each adventurer that fails suffers one level of fatigue.

**Success.** The adventurers lose 2 (1d4) hours of travel time.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers continue unhindered and the landslide

triggers behind them. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Lethal Outgassing

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Poisonous gases once trapped deep within the soil and rock of this area are leaking into the air. These fumes are deadly to people who breathe them for too long, making for a dangerous situation to both passersby and those living in the area.

**Spell Solve.** The outgassing can be temporarily ventilated by the casting of a gust of wind spell (making the air in that space breathable for up to 1 hour), but adventurers need to find the offending soil and rock to permanently get rid of it.

#### Possible Solutions

The party needs to make a group check to get through, with at least one each of the following:

* An Investigation check to find the source of the gas.
* A Nature check to understand the outgassing phenomenon.
* An Engineering check to plug up the leak.
* Survival checks can be made by those simply trying to last long enough to fix the problem.

**Critical Failure.** Adventurers breathe in the fumes and are poisoned, gaining a level of fatigue, and taking 21 (6d6) poison damage at the end of every hour spent in the gas cloud. Local areas suffer heavy loss in the wake of the destructive gases.

**Failure.** Adventurers breathe in the fumes and are poisoned, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage at the end of every hour spent in the gas cloud. The area around it suffers minor loss in the wake of the destructive gases.

**Success.** Adventurers successfully traverse the dangerous area.

**Critical Success.** Adventurers successfully prevent the outgassing from claiming further lives and they take no damage in the process. Roll twice on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Lifeless Desolation

*3rd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP); DC 19/16

**Area** Greater (1 day)

Dust lazily drifts across featureless salt flats that extend to the horizon. Food and water are nowhere to be found � and neither is hope.

**Devoid of Radiance.** Spells that deal radiant damage deal half as much damage, and healing spells restore half as many hit points as normal.

**Lifeless.** There are no sources of food or water, and any journey activity checks made in the area to acquire more Supply automatically fail.

**Natural Undead.** Any corpse that is not completely destroyed rises as an undead 24 hours later. The type of undead is at the Narrator�s discretion. A Nature check notices that there are no corpses or even skeletons to be found, no matter how small or large (though what that might mean is unclear).

**Nowhere to Hide.** Stealth checks made in this area have disadvantage.

**Unnatural Stress.** Boredom and the overwhelming desolation weigh more heavily on the mind with every day that passes. At the end of each short or long rest in this area, each adventurer makes a Wisdom saving throw or they suffer a level of strife.

#### Possible Solutions

Traversing this area requires spirit and conviction more than physical endurance. The party needs to make a group check to get through the region. Adventurers can choose from the following:

* A Performance check to inspire some humor, levity, and vibrancy.
* A Religion check to pray to gods of light and hope to protect the party from whatever fell forces pervade this area.
* A Wisdom saving throw to persevere in the face of despair.

**Critical Failure.** The fell forces pervading the area prevent recuperation. While in the area, long rests are not possible and short rests take 8 hours (instead of 1 hour).

**Failure.** While in the area, short rests take 2 hours and long rests take 16 hours.

**Success.** Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

**Critical Success.** Roll three times on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Living Land

*2nd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Greater (1 day)

As the party walks along, they start to notice that the plants are responding to them, and then a woody voice greets them.

Everything in a 10-mile radius has been awakened by a crotchety druid who expected nothing but courtesy, and the plants and animals are the same � if they feel that they are not granted that courtesy they can make life very difficult for passersby.

**Benign.** A Nature check confirms that this is the result of benign magic.

#### Possible Solutions

Being overtly rude or hostile to the awakened plants causes them to withdraw and triggers a Critical Failure. Otherwise, a successful group check using the following options allow the adventurers to travel across the area.

* + An Animal Handling check helps reassure unsettled animals that there is no threat.
  + A Persuasion check convinces the plants that the party is friendly.
  + A Nature check allows the party to walk carefully without damaging anything.
  + A Religion check can help appease the nature gods.

**Critical Failure.** The area counts as difficult terrain and each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue from snagging groundcover or troublesome roots.

**Failure.** The area counts as difficult terrain and the journey takes twice as long.

**Success.** The adventurers are allowed to pass unhindered, and at the edge of the area they�re given delicious berries and mushrooms making up 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply.

**Critical Success.** As a success, and the impressed plants tell the party about something of use to them. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Lost Item

*0th tier (circumstance)*

**Challenge** 1/2 (100 XP); DC 12/10

**Area** Immediate (special)

While walking along, something important drops from an adventurer�s pack � a cherished trinket, common magic item, gold pouch, or similar � and falls with a plink into a sewer, crack in the rock, or other irritatingly small place. The opening is 1 inch wide, at least 1 foot long, and 3 feet deep.

**Stuck.** The Narrator may rule that the object is stuck, making *mage hand* an ineffective solution and increasing the CR of this encounter by 1 and the DC for checks by 2.

#### Possible Solutions

Use of the *mage hand* cantrip easily retrieves most items, triggering a success, as does magic that can shape stone or

earth, or an Athletics check, to widen the opening enough that the item can be retrieved. Alternatively, a thieves� tools check (or a similar tool kit) retrieves the item.

**Critical Failure.** The item slips further and is lost forever.

**Failure.** The item becomes stuck (see above). Another attempt is permitted.

**Success.** The item is retrieved.

**Critical Success.** The item is retrieved along with 2 (1d4) random items that were also lost down there.

### Magical Overgrowth

*2nd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

The path ahead is completely overrun with plants that regrow within seconds of being cut!

**Magical Effect.** The overgrowth is a magical effect created through evocation magic. Using *dispel magic* on the plants to suppress its enchantment for 1 hour requires a spellcasting ability check, and on a success the adventurers gain an expertise die on ability checks made against the overgrowth.

**Vulnerable to Fire.** When an adventurer uses an attack, spell, or other effects that deals fire damage against the overgrowth they gain an expertise die on their next ability check against it.

#### Possible Solutions

With a group Acrobatics check the adventurers squeeze through the brush, or with an Athletics check cut through it. A Nature check can reveal the path of least resistance.

**Critical Failure.** Travel time in the overgrowth is tripled, and adventurers each suffer one level of fatigue.

**Failure.** Travel time in the overgrowth is doubled.

**Success.** The adventurers pass through the undergrowth with no delay.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers pass through the overgrowth with no delay. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Malfunctioning Planar Portal

*4th tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 16 (15,000 XP); DC 21/17

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

The sky turns dark and purple as lightning crackles, converging on a pool of oily, swirling energy crackling in the middle of a 20-foot wide circle of stones. The planar portal has � through time or deliberate sabotage � become dysfunctional and the effects of the unstable magics are spreading. It is immediately apparent what has happened, and that if left unchallenged the portal will continue to expand with catastrophically lethal consequences.

**Violent Weather.** While the planar portal itself is relatively small, its effects spread across the landscape in a 10-mile radius, filling the area with high winds, rain, and lightning strikes. Adventurers can only hear sounds within 15 feet of them (except for loud, explosive noises). In addition, at the end of each minute a randomly determined adventurer makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) lightning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

**What�s Broken? An** Arcana check reveals that the reason the portal broke was because a stone around it fell within, breaking the magical circle that kept it intact.

#### Possible Solutions

This challenge requires a group check using Arcana, Engineering, and stonecutter�s tools. Mending is not sufficient to repair the damage to the portal, but a fabricate or similar spell can recreate the stone needed to fix it, counting as a successful check from the adventurer casting the spell.

**Critical Failure.** The portal expands and each adventurer suffers a level of strife.

The party loses 4 (1d4 + 2) days going around it, each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue during the intensified storms,

and over the course of the next month the area around the portal becomes a wasteland.

**Failure.** Each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue from trying to fix the portal and the errant magic strips the party of 8 (2d6

+ 1) Supply, but they manage to stabilize it enough that it does not expand further.

**Success.** The storm ends and the portal collapses, forever turning the area between the stones into a void of magic (as the *antimagic field* spell but with a permanent duration).

**Critical Success.** The adventurers restore the portal to full functionality (where it leads is at the Narrator�s discretion). Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Marsh Gas

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); DC 17/15

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Gases bubble upon the marsh�s surface � the gas is poisonous at best and combustible at worst.

**Realize Danger.** Any adventurer that makes a Nature check recognizes the prevalence and dangers posed by the marsh gas.

#### Possible Solutions

A Medicine check and use of a healer�s satchel (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) can create a remedy to the poisonous gases, or a group Survival check enables the party to carefully navigate the marsh.

**Critical Failure.** Travel time in the marsh is doubled, adventurers are poisoned for 4 (1d4 + 2) hours, and each takes (22) 4d10 fire damage from exploding gas.

**Failure.** Adventurers become poisoned for 2 (1d4) hours, and each takes 11 (2d10) fire damage from exploding gas.

**Success.** The adventurers safely cross the marsh.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers pass through the marsh safely without penalty

or injury. Additionally, an alchemist�s supplies or poisoner�s kit check harvests enough gas for 2 (1d4) vials of basic poison or explosive flasks (which function as alchemist�s fire, but deal regular fire damage instead of ongoing fire damage).

### Mushroom Ring

*1st tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A ring of orange and purple mushrooms, perfect and unbroken, blocks the path. This is the home of a very curious pixie � suffering from boredom � that follows the adventurers for miles in search of entertainment.

**Awareness.** A Perception check spots the pixie, who is too shy to approach.

**Esoteric Knowledge.** An Arcana or Religion check reveals that faeries sometimes plant mushroom rings to signify their home.

**Natural Knowledge.** A Nature check reveals that mushroom rings can sometimes be formed around a particularly rich area of soil, such as a buried corpse.

**Studious.** A History check recalls stories of pixies rewarding those who leave them small gifts.

#### Possible Solutions

This challenge hinges on how the adventurers choose to proceed. A group Acrobatics check can be used to carefully step over the ring.

If the adventurers break or otherwise defile the ring, they incense the pixie. The next time they take a short or long rest, the party realizes that 4 (1d4 + 2) pieces of their gear are broken and 3 (1d4 + 1) are damaged.

If they keep their distance and respect the area, they feel like they are being watched for several miles after encountering the mushroom ring, making Perception checks with disadvantage until they take their next long rest.

If they leave a small gift for the fey or do something that it strongly approves of, soon

after leaving they find flower petals leading them to something important. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Perilous Cliff Path

*3rd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 14 (11,500 XP); DC 20/16

**Area** Local (1 hour)

The road ahead is narrow and wraps around a steep, rocky cliff. Groups traveling light should watch their steps � rocks can break off and knock travelers off their footing in an instant.

**Narrow.** Adventurers with mounts, wagons, or other bulky travel gear have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks without a creative solution for animals, vehicles, and ungainly items.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Acrobatics check is needed to deftly traverse the path. If an adventurer makes an Engineering check to rig climbing gear together and secure everything to the mountainside, everybody gains an expertise die and any falling damage is halved.

**Critical Failure.** Each adventurer (and any mounts or vehicles) falls 200 feet down the steep mountainside, taking 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage and suffering two levels of fatigue.

**Failure.** Each adventurer (and any mounts or vehicles) falls 100 feet down the steep mountainside, taking 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and suffering a level of fatigue.

**Success.** The adventurers safely traverse the path.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers traverse the path. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Pests

*1st tier (creatures)*

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP); DC 15/14

**Area** Immediate (special)

A nasty horde of bugs has broken into the party�s provisions and are eating them all

up! The insects need to be dealt with quickly or desperate times are imminent.

#### Possible Solutions

An Animal Handling check drives the pests away or a Nature check locates a tastier treat to lure the pests away.

**Critical Failure.** All of the party�s food and water are ruined and each adventurer loses their entire Supply.

**Failure.** Each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply to the pests.

**Success.** The adventurers deal with the pests without losing any Supply.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers deal with the pests without losing any Supply. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Pit Trap

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); DC 15/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A group of crafty bandits have dug a hole right in the middle of the road and filled it with spikes. They also covered it with leaves and flimsy wood to hide the trap! The hole is so large that riding and pack animals cannot move around it as the path is surrounded by dense forest or steep cliffs.

**Solo Challenge.** Each adventurer decides for themselves how to avoid the pit trap.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 15 or with a Perception check. If the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

Who falls into the pit depends on the actions of the party and how they organize crossing attempts. An Acrobatics or Athletics check allows an adventurer to climb or leap across the pit. On a failure they fall 20 feet to take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and 5 (2d4) piercing damage. Alternatively, an Engineering check (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) can be made to build a makeshift bridge across the spike pit at the cost of 1 hour.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer(s) and their mount(s) fall 20 feet into the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the drop and 5 (2d4) piercing damage from spikes. At the end of the next round 3 (1d6) bandits arrive to ambush the party.

**Failure.** The adventurer(s) drop half their Supply into the pit.

**Success.** The adventurers make it across or around the spike pit unscathed.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers make it across or around the spike pit unscathed. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Poison Darts

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

When a pressure plate concealed on the ground registers 20 or more pounds of weight, poisoned darts fire from the wall, ceiling, or floor.

**Poisoned Darts.** *Ranged Weapon Attack.* +6 to hit, one creature. *Hit.* 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 16 (3d10) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or becomes poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned, the target�s flesh swells and it has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and attack rolls made using Dexterity. A Medicine check can treat the poison.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Investigation of 18 to notice the slits and holes that conceal the poisoned darts. If not detected, the trap automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Acrobatics check allows the adventurers to safely move around the pressure plate. Alternatively, a thieves� tools check disables the trap.

**Critical Failure.** Each adventurer and mount in the area is targeted by 2 (1d4) poisoned darts.

**Failure.** Each adventurer and mount in the area is targeted by a poisoned dart.

**Success.** The adventurers evade or dismantle the trap.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers evade or dismantle the trap and acquire a vial of the poison (enough to coat a single blade or up to three pieces of ammunition).

### Poison Needle

*3rd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP); DC 19/16

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

A poison needle is hidden inside a locking mechanism of a chest or door, or otherwise concealed in something that an adventurer might be inclined to touch. The needle trap triggers when the object is manipulated.

**Poisons Aplenty.** There are a wide variety of poisons that might be applied to a poison needle.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Investigation of 20. If the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

A Sleight of Hand check to trigger the poison needle without taking damage, or a thieves� tools check to disarm the trap.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer that failed the check triggers the needle, taking 1 piercing damage and 44 (8d10) poison damage. In addition, they must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

**Failure.** The adventurer that failed the check triggers the needle, taking 1 piercing damage and 22 (4d10) poison damage. In addition, they must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

**Success.** The adventurer disarms the trap without taking damage.

**Critical Success.** The adventurer disarms the trap and can keep the poison needle (which functions as a dart with the poison applied to it, using the poison statistics from a critical failure).

### Primordial Tornado

*3rd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP); DC 19/16 **Area** Intermediate (3 hours) Something shimmers on the horizon,

rapidly drawing nearer � a tornado, but not like any cyclone they�ve seen before. Roll 1d4 to determine the type of tornado. 1 � water (sharks optional), 2 � fire, 3 � lightning, 4 � sand. The primordial tornado affects a 3-mile radius, and normal methods for withstanding or avoiding a tornado are ineffective against it.

**Spell Gone Awry.** An Arcana check indicates that this is an elemental spell gone wrong.

**Tempest Winds.** When a creature rolls a natural 1 on an ability check against the tornado, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be thrown 2 (1d4) miles, taking 52 (15d6) bludgeoning damage. In addition, the primordial tornado deals an additional 14 (4d6) damage determined by its type. bludgeoning for water (or piercing if sharks are included), fire, lightning, or slashing for sand. A creature suffers one level of fatigue for every 20 damage it takes from being thrown by the primordial tornado.

#### Possible Solutions

A spell that allows the caster to manipulate the relevant element and affects a large enough area can redirect the tornado, though any spell with a casting time greater than an action will likely take too long.

Alternatively, a group Athletics check can withstand the tornado and trudge forward, taking 14 (4d6) additional damage determined by the tornado�s type, or a Survival check can quickly find shelter and take cover, waiting a day for the storm to pass.

**Critical Failure.** Each of the adventurers loses half their Supply, and they suffer both a level of fatigue and a level of strife.

**Failure.** The party avoids the primordial tornado but it is a frantic and desperate

escape. Each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply and suffers a level of fatigue.

**Success.** The adventurers avoid the primordial tornado�s fury.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers avoid or overcome the primordial tornado, and its passing reveals something of import. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Private Property

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

In order to get where they�re going the party needs to pass through someone else�s property. It is gated off with high fences, guards, and attack dogs � no expense was spared to keep trespassers out of this area.

**Material Aid.** Adventurers can use certain materials to gain an expertise die on an appropriate ability check. For example, a bribe of 10 gold might be used to gain an expertise die on a Persuasion check, and acquiring the patrol schedule might gain an expertise die on a Stealth check.

#### Possible Solutions

An Intimidation check scares the forces guarding the property or a Persuasion check can bribe them. Alternatively, the adventurers can make a group DC 13 Stealth check to sneak across the property.

**Critical Failure.** Adventurers are pursued by a guard squad and each suffer one level of fatigue after the ensuing chase or fight.

**Failure.** A patrol of 3 (1d4 + 1) guards pursue the adventurers.

**Success.** The adventurers successfully traverse the property and lose 2 hours of travel time in the process.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers deftly traverse the property unhindered. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Poorly-Repaired Tunnel

*0th tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); DC 13/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

This tunnel has suffered some damage and though repairs have been made its structure is not entirely stable.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 13 or with a Perception check to notice the construction. If not detected, the trap automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

Only one check is needed to circumvent this exploration challenge. Finding and using the precise route the trapbuilder used is the most straightforward answer, requiring each adventurer to make a DC 13 Acrobatics check. Alternatively, a DC 14 Engineering check can be made to prop up the ceiling and effectively disarm the trap.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers trigger the trap, causing chunks of earth and stone to rain down. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (2d8) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

Failure on the saving throw also causes a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The party triggers the trap, causing chunks of earth and stone to rain down. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (2d8) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

**Success.** The PCs avoid or disarm the trap.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers avoid or disarm the trap but have the option to leave the trap active for someone else to deal with.

### Public Ceremony

*0th tier (circumstance)*

**Challenge** 1/4 (50 XP); DC 12/10

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

Music, drumming, cheering, or mourning emanates from ahead, and the way is blocked by a mass of bodies. Moving through the crowd is almost impossible. Roll 1d4 to determine the type of ceremony, or

make one up. 1 � festival, 2 � religious event, 3 � military parade, 4 � funeral.

#### Possible Solutions

A group check is needed to get through this crowd. Each adventurer can choose from an Athletics check to climb nearby buildings or trees and move above the crowd, or a Persuasion, Performance or Religion check to blend in, moving with the festival and slowly crossing to the other side.

**Critical Failure.** Each adventurer is trampled, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, suffering a level of fatigue, and losing 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Failure.** Each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue and is moved 250 (2d4 � 50) feet with the procession before getting to the other side.

**Success.** Each adventurer is able to travel through the crowd without incident.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers are mistaken for participants and are thanked by a grateful individual or group who makes way for them, allowing the party to move across unhindered. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

Going back or around takes 3 (1d4 + 2) hours.

### Quicksand

*1st tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); DC 15/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Suddenly the ground gives way and in a matter of seconds everyone is knee or waist-deep in dirt, muck, and sand!

**Rescue.** An Acrobatics or Athletics check made within the first two rounds can pull a creature free from the quicksand.

**Spell Solve.** Spells that shape stone or earth can render the quicksand stable, granting advantage on checks made to escape.

**Turn-Based Action.** If any of the adventurers are caught in the quicksand,

they become grappled and at the beginning of each of their turns the quicksand sucks them in further. At the beginning of an adventurer�s second turn they become restrained, at the beginning of their third turn they are unable to use their arms at all, and at the end of their fourth turn they become totally submerged and must hold their breath or suffocate.

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, *rope trick*, or similar magic triggers an automatic success for that adventurer.

#### Possible Solutions

Navigating the quicksand requires a group Acrobatics or Survival check.

**Critical Failure.** Any adventurers who failed their check are caught in the quicksand. In addition, they lose 4 (2d4) Supply each and gain a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** Each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply in the struggle to get through the muck.

**Success.** The adventurers make it through, filthy but unharmed.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers find the body of an unlucky traveler in the quicksand, their pack waterproofed and containing 5 (1d4 + 3) Supply that�s been well-preserved.

### River Rapids

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Frothy eddies and whorls create a deceptively intense undertow in this 200-foot waterway, its powerful current launching spills over slick and smooth boulders.

**Fly Away.** The use of *fly* or similar magic (except *levitate*) triggers a critical success for that adventurer.

**Wait.** A Nature check reveals that the waters will be lower tomorrow and crossing will be less hazardous. If the party waits, they have advantage on checks made to cross it then.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Athletics check is needed to swim across the water, made with advantage if a rope is tied over the river, or an Animal Handling check to ford the river on a mount of at least Large size.

**Critical Failure.** The party is carried 500 (2d4 � 100) feet downriver (roll separately for each adventurer), losing 4 (1d4 + 2) hours of travel time and 7 (3d4) Supply.

**Failure.** Each adventurer that fails suffers a level of fatigue and is carried 250 (2d4 � 50) feet downriver. The party loses 2 (1d4) hours of travel time regrouping.

**Success.** The adventurers cross safely.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers cross safely, and they discover a gift or clue along the way. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

Bypassing the river and crossing in a safe place is possible but takes a great deal of time � safely traveling around it costs an extra day of travel time.

### Rockfall

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

Poorly secured barrels, rocks nudged by a sizable creature, or some other wave of objects come tumbling down directly onto the adventurers!

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, *rope trick*, or similar magic triggers a critical success.

#### Possible Solutions

Make a group check. Each adventurer may choose from a Dexterity saving throw to dodge out of the way, a Constitution saving throw to simply withstand the barrage, or an Engineering check to rapidly reinforce or improvise cover.

**Critical Failure.** Adventurers, mounts, and vehicles take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning

damage. Each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply and suffers a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** Adventurers that fail their check suffer a level of fatigue.

**Success.** The objects pass through without consequence.

**Critical Success.** Something unexpected is revealed inside a broken barrel or from damage wrought to the area. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Rolling Sphere

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

When a pressure plate concealed on the ground registers 20 or more pounds of weight, a trapdoor opens in the wall or ceiling and releases a Huge stone sphere that rolls directly towards the adventurers.

**Hold It!** An adventurer can make an Athletics check to stop the sphere from rolling after the trap is triggered. This allows the rest of the party to get away, but the PC holding it up suffers a level of fatigue.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 18. If the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

### Possible Solutions

An Engineering check can adequately obstruct the sphere before the trap is triggered, and a thieves� tools check can disarm the trap before triggering it.

**Critical Failure.** Adventurers must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

**Failure.** Adventurers must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (5d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

**Success.** The adventurers manage to avoid or disarm the trap.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers avoid or disarm the trap but have the

option to leave the trap active for someone else to deal with.

### Rooftop Run

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); DC 15/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

An event forces the party into a hectic rooftop chase! Roll 1d4 or select one of the following events. 1 � a pickpocket steals something from one of the adventurers, 2 � the party witnesses a crime down a nearby alley, 3 � a noble�s exotic pet escapes, 4 � the party sees an enemy they have encountered before. The target flees, running, jumping, and leaping across angled shingles, chimneys, and warped wood struts.

#### Possible Solutions

Every participant on each side of the chase rolls initiative as normal. At the start of each participant�s turn, they choose what tactics to use to flee, pursue, or otherwise race forward, making an ability check. A participant cannot use the same tactic two rounds in a row. The first participant to achieve 10 successes wins the chase by either making an escape, blocking their competitors� travel, catching their prey, taking the right shortcuts, or just being a little faster.

When a participant has a Speed of 45 feet or higher, they have advantage on ability checks made for the chase.

Examples of appropriate checks include:

* Acrobatics to run across ledges, ropes, and other precarious surfaces to cross the rooftops. On a failure, that adventurer falls 20 feet down to the streets, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.
* Athletics to leap from rooftop to rooftop. On a failure, that adventurer�s next ability check is made with disadvantage.
* Engineering to predict the arrangement of buildings ahead and take a more expedient route. On a failure, that adventurer stumbles into a minor hazard and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
* Perception to keep track of participants while stuck on the streets below.
* Stealth to use cover and confound the other side of the chase. On a failure, that adventurer cannot attempt another Stealth check next round.

**Critical Failure.** Each time an adventurer rolls a critical failure they remove 1 success from their side�s total successes for the chase. An adventurer can choose to instead suffer a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The participant holds their own, their position in the chase neither improving or worsening. An adventurer loses or otherwise ruins 1 Supply.

**Success.** The participant adds 1 success to their side�s total successes for the chase.

**Critical Success.** The participant adds 2 successes to their side�s total successes for the chase.

### Rot Grubs

*2nd tier (creatures)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

The corpse of a slain adventurer or monster lies upon the ground and when closely observed it explodes with disgusting flesh-eating parasites!

**Spell Solve.** A casting of *detect poison and disease* reveals the presence of rot grubs inside of a corpse.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 20 to notice the skin of the corpse moves unnaturally. If

the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

Dealing at least 10 fire damage kills the rot grubs, triggering a critical success, while covering and pulverizing the corpse with at least 50 bludgeoning damage kills the rot grubs, triggering a success. If the party hesitates or does nothing, a failure is triggered, and if they interfere with the corpse a critical failure occurs.

**Critical Failure.** Each adventurer within 20 feet of the corpse makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the adventurer is hit by 1d4 rot grubs that burrow into their skin, dealing 3 (1d6) ongoing damage until removed. Removing the rot grubs requires taking fire damage (as above), having each dug out with a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage (1d6 per rot grub), or an effect that removes disease. The corpse and all of its belongings are ruined.

**Failure.** As a critical failure, but only one rot grub hits each adventurer within 10 feet of the corpse.

**Success.** The rot grubs perish inside the corpse and the adventurers salvage 5d20 gold worth of equipment.

**Critical Success.** As a success, and roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Sandstorm

*2nd tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Sand, grit, and glass pelt the flesh as powerful winds fling debris in such overwhelming amounts that navigation is nearly impossible.

**Extremely High Winds.** Ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage and can only be made with thrown weapons, unattended and poorly secured objects fly off in the wind, and flying is nearly impossible (requiring an Acrobatics check each minute to avoid plummeting to the ground). At the end of each hour in this area, each adventurer must succeed on a

Strength saving throw or be thrown 50 feet by the wind, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone.

**Reduced Visibility.** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 5 feet. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

**Ropes.** Any adventurers attached together by rope have advantage on saving throws to resist being thrown by the wind, but on a failed save anyone directly attached to a thrown adventurer is themselves thrown half as far.

#### Possible Solutions

An Engineering check allows an adventurer to hastily assemble improvised shelter capable of surviving the sandstorm, losing 7 (2d6) hours, or a group Survival check helps push through the onslaught.

**Critical Failure.** Everything is lost! All of the party�s Supply and one randomly determined item from each adventurer is scattered to the winds. Collecting all of their belongings after the storm ends (in 3 hours) takes 13 (2d12) hours, and even then half of their Supply is ruined.

**Failure.** Each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply to the sands and winds.

**Success.** The adventurers have to brush off a thick coating of sand but otherwise push through the storm.

**Critical Success.** The storm passes quickly or the adventurers find an unexpected route (a steep canyon, underground passage, and so on) that allows them to continue unhindered.

### Sea of Sand

*0th tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Undulating waves of dunes stretch toward a horizon distorted by waves of heat. The sand shifts and flows to cover up tracks in a matter of moments, and the dunes are both exhausting to crest and dangerous to descend.

**Appropriate Gear.** The use of appropriate mounts (such as camels) and keeping a light pack (less than half carrying capacity) allow for travel at a normal pace without suffering from Unforgiving Heat.

**Cool Nights.** The cool nights alleviate the dangers of travel under the blazing sun. Night time travel has its own issues such as predators and tripping hazards, but reduces the strain of the journey and adventurers gain an expertise die on checks made against the exploration challenge.

**Hilly.** When a creature is knocked prone, it makes a Dexterity saving throw or tumbles 20 feet down a sand dune.

**Sandy.** The area is difficult terrain, and Survival checks made to find tracks have disadvantage.

**Unforgiving Heat.** When traveling through this area during the day at faster than a slow pace, at the end of every hour each adventurer and mount must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer a level of fatigue. Immunity to fire damage grants an automatic success on this save.

#### Possible Solutions

A group Survival or Athletics check is needed to traverse the sand dunes.

**Critical Failure.** All of the water being carried by the party evaporates or spoils. The adventurers suffer a level of fatigue and need to locate a source of water as soon as they reach a new area.

**Failure.** Each of the adventurers lose 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply to contamination or spoiling in the heat.

**Success.** A hardened pass of dirt and stone allows for a reasonably flat and straight path.

**Critical Success.** The party stumbles upon a natural spring or oasis. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Shattered Earth

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP); DC 17/15

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Massive pillars, plates of stone, and earthen boulders haphazardly confound the broken landscape ahead and navigating a way through requires equal amounts of careful stepping, scaling rock formations, and rounding obstacles.

**On Foot.** Land vehicles and most mounts cannot traverse this area, and in order to continue the party must dismount and unload overladen wagons. Squeezing through narrow passes, lifting heavy loads over debris, and ducking under stone overhangs quadruples the amount of time needed to travel through this area with vehicles or mounts.

**Precarious Boulders.** Boulders tumble down whenever they are even slightly disturbed by passersby far below. At the end of every hour spent in this area, roll 1d20. On a result of 15 or more, rocks fall. Each adventurer makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (2d12) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. In addition, on a failed save they are knocked prone and restrained by the boulder. The boulders are large enough to offer three-fourths cover or potentially block passage forward.

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly, levitate*, or similar magic to scout ahead triggers a critical success.

#### Possible Solutions

A successful group check using the following options will allow the adventurers to travel across the area:

* Acrobatics check to avoid putting too much weight on any step.
* Athletics check to scale the walls and reach a set of boulders.
* Perception check to spot a set of precarious boulders.
* Stealth check to move in utter silence and disturb as little of the terrain as possible.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers become trapped after a catastrophic collapse of stone and rock. Digging themselves and their equipment out takes a day, and the party loses 2 (1d4) days travel time making it through this area.

**Failure.** The adventurers each suffer a level of fatigue but make it through this area.

**Success.** The adventurers make it through this area.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers find a path through the maze of rock and safely make it through in just 1 hour. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

Bypassing the precarious area is possible but takes a great deal of time � safely traveling around it costs an extra 5 (2d4) days of travel time.

### Sinkhole

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

As the adventurers travel the ground beneath them suddenly gives way! The sinkhole is 30 feet across and 60 feet deep, and it forms immediately.

**Premonition.** Adventurers with a passive Perception of 16 or higher notice something is off about the ground and gain an expertise die on their Dexterity saving throw.

#### Possible Solutions

Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, falling into the pit on a failure and taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage upon landing. For those within the pit, an Athletics check is needed to climb out (made with disadvantage if lifting wagons or mounts). An Engineering check can be made to jury-rig a rope system to give everybody advantage.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer fails an attempt, losing 3 (1d6) Supply and suffering a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The adventurer fails an attempt and loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Success.** Adventurers avoid or make it out of the sinkhole.

**Critical Success.** Adventurers make it out of the sinkhole. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Sphere of Annihilation

*3rd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

Inside the mouth of a statue or well is nothing but void � a *sphere of annihilation* concealed as a simple hole or pit with the promise that something of value may be hidden beyond it.

**Tales.** A History check recalls tales of horror involving the use of a fell sphere or information about those who built the statue or well.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Investigation of 20 to notice the subtle runes and glyphs carved around the void, but only if observed under the effects of detect magic.

#### Possible Solutions

The outcome of this exploration challenge is not measured by failures or successes, instead depending entirely upon the party�s actions. An Arcana check identifies the sphere once it has been detected.

The sphere completely annihilates anything that passes through it, with the exception of artifacts. Anything that touches the sphere but does not entirely pass through it takes 44 (8d10) force damage. In addition, the energies of the sphere spoil any Supply the adventurer is carrying.

A unique effect happens if the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal or extradimensional space (such as a portable hole). In the case of such an event, the Narrator rolls d100 to determine what happens next. on 1�50 the sphere is destroyed, on 51�85 the sphere simply moves through the portal or into the space, and on 86�100 a rift forms that pulls in all creatures and objects within 180 feet. Each

object and creature, including the sphere, reappears in a random plane of existence.

Using their combined knowledge and some good luck the adventurers can gain control of the *sphere of annihilation* with a DC 25 Arcana check.

If the party manages to get past the sphere, roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Spinning Walls

*3rd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

When a pressure plate concealed on the ground registers 20 or more pounds of weight, solid stone walls shift, slide, and spin as the structure around the party becomes an ever-changing maze that blocks them off from each other, swiftly carrying everyone in different directions.

The walls can be any solid surface appropriate to the environment, setting, and situation � stone barriers in a castle�s dungeon, mindless constructs in ancient catacombs, heaving earth in an archdruid�s warren, arcane barriers of solid translucent light below an archmage�s tower, and so on.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Investigation of 20 to notice the panel that triggers it.

#### Possible Solutions

Each adventurer rolls 1d12 at the start of each round. Any adventurers with duplicate results are moved together, but otherwise each member of the party becomes isolated and moved to another passage away from their allies.

An Engineering check can disable the trap for 1 minute, during which an Intelligence check can be made by each adventurer to navigate to a particular point.

A Dexterity saving throw allows an adventurer to leap towards one ally in the same section and be moved with them; alternatively, adventurers who rope themselves together move together. An Engineering check can also reveal the

nature of what�s going on � the adventurer rolls 2d12, choosing which to use.

The challenge ends when all the adventurers are next to each other.

**Critical Failure.** The ordeal is particularly jarring, long, and painful. Each adventurer loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply, suffering one level of fatigue and strife.

**Failure.** The adventurer suffers one level of fatigue and strife.

**Success.** The adventurer suffers one level of fatigue or one level of strife (determined by their actions and the Narrator).

**Critical Success.** The adventurers deftly make it through this vexing obstacle and one of them finds something important. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Stampede

*0th tier (creatures)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

**Area** Local (1 hour)

A massive herd of stampeding animals are racing towards the party with little to no regard for what�s in their way!

***Up and Away.*** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, *rope trick*, or similar magic triggers an automatic success for that adventurer.

#### Possible Solutions

Each adventurer decides for themselves how to avoid the stampede as part of a group check.

* An Acrobatics or Athletics check can outrun the herd. This check is made with disadvantage if the adventurers have pack animals with them.
* An Animal Handling check diverts the herd. Anyone able to speak to animals (from a class feature or spell) has advantage.
* A Survival check to search for high ground to wait it out.

**Critical Failure.** Each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue and the party loses a pack animal, if they have one.

**Failure.** Each adventurer suffers a level of fatigue.

**Success.** The adventurers successfully avoid the stampede and continue on their way.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers successfully avoid the stampede. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Sunspots

*3rd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Region (time varies)

The sun seems weirdly blotchy, like something has stained its surface, and the light shining on the ground ahead appears dappled as well. Magic is unpredictable in the area for the next 2 days and every night is moonless, making it completely dark.

**Incensed Fauna.** The strange light sets beasts and monsters in the area into fits of rage and they attack the party on sight. The party has to overcome at least one random monster encounter while in the area.

**Unpredictable Magic.** Spells cast at night or in the shade function normally. When a spell is cast in the sunlight, roll 1d4. On a 1 the spell fails, on a 2 the spell fails and the spellcaster rolls on the Wild Magic Surge table, or on a 3 or 4 the spell functions normally and the spellcaster rolls on the Wild Magic Surge table. When rolling on the Wild Magic Surge table because of Sunspots, roll 1d12 instead of 1d10, and a result of 11 or 12 it triggers a Critical Failure.

#### Possible Solutions

This task simply involves traversing the area.

* + Trial and error reveals that the sun�s light currently has adverse effects on magic. Traveling at night triggers a success.
* An Arcana, Nature, or Religion check reveals that this is a natural aberration of the sun, not the effect of interference.
* An Investigation check determines that spellcasting functions normally in the shade.

**Critical Failure.** A spell fails dramatically and without warning, debilitating everyone nearby. Each of the adventurers is slowed for the next 7 (2d6) hours.

**Failure.** Each adventurer loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply from stumbling around in the dark or when briefly blinded by the sun�s strange behavior.

***Success.*** The adventurers travel through the area unhindered.

***Critical Success.*** The adventurers travel through the area unhindered and the phenomenon uncovers something interesting. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

Bypassing the capricious anomaly or hoping it subsides is possible but takes a great deal of time � safely traveling around it costs an extra 4 (1d6 + 1) days of travel time.

### Swinging Blades

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP); DC 18/15

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

The corridor ahead is filled with churning blades for 20 feet or more of the passage. Whenever an adventurer enters into a square in the area or begins their turn there, they are attacked by a swinging blade.

**History.** A History check reveals information about the people who constructed the trap, granting advantage on Engineering and Perception checks to disable it.

**More Blades.** For each additional 10 feet added to the area beyond the first 20 feet, increase this encounter�s challenge rating by 1.

**Swinging Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +6 to hit, one target. *Hit.* 10 (3d6) slashing damage and the target makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it is knocked prone.

#### Possible Solutions

With an Acrobatics check an adventurer can time a tumbling roll through the blades and take no damage.

An Engineering check (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) can be made to wedge a blade in place. On a failure by 5 or less, the wedge is temporary. Roll 1d4 each time someone passes through, and on a 1 the wedge breaks and the blade comes down (attacking with advantage).

**Critical Failure.** The swinging blades have advantage on their attack rolls, and any swinging blade that hits gets a critical hit.

**Failure.** The swinging blades have advantage on their attack rolls.

**Success.** Only 1 (1d4 � 1) swinging blades attack each adventurer (minimum 1).

**Critical Success.** The adventurers make it through safely and find or discover something of value from the nearby corpse of someone not so lucky. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Thundering Stampede

*2nd tier (creatures)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

An enormous herd of stampeding animals are racing through and destroying everything that stands in their way! Each adventurer can decide for themselves how to avoid the stampede.

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, *rope trick*, or similar magic triggers a critical success for that adventurer.

#### Possible Solutions

Each adventurer decides for themselves how to avoid the stampede as part of a group check.

* An Acrobatics or Athletics check can outrun the herd. This check is made with disadvantage if the adventurers have pack animals with them.
* An Animal Handling check diverts the herd. Anyone able to speak to animals (from a class feature or spell) has advantage.
* A Survival check to search for high ground to wait it out.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses a pack animal, if they have one. Each adventurer takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply, and suffers a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** Each adventurer takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage, loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply and suffers a level of fatigue.

**Success.** The party manages to avoid the stampede and continue on their way.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers successfully avoid the stampede. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

A party that waits out the stampede finds the ground ahead is completely destroyed by the thousands of hooves or paws that just trod upon it, sucking their feet down into the mulched dirt with every step and increasing their travel time by 5 (2d4) hours.

### Thunderstorm

*1st tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Greater (1 day)

A blinding bolt of light strikes the ground followed by deafening rolling thunder. The torrential rain soaks everything, fills concavities, and turns dust to mud. Flash flooding is imminent.

***S*lippery.** Deluges of rain turn the area into difficult terrain.

**Violent Weather.** The thunderstorm�s effects spread across the landscape in a 20-mile radius, filling the area with high winds, rain, and lightning strikes.

Adventurers can only hear sounds within

30 feet of them (except for loud, explosive noises). In addition, every 1d10 hours a randomly determined adventurer makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

#### Possible Solutions

The party can make an Engineering check to hastily construct improvised shelter or a group Survival check to push through the storm and endure the elements.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses 1 day of travel time in the thunderstorm. Each adventurer finds that water has ruined 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply and they suffer a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The party loses 7 (3d4) hours of travel time in the thunderstorm and 1d4 Supply.

**Success.** The party pushes through the worst of the thunderstorm after 5 (2d4) hours of travel.

**Critical Success.** The party pushes through the worst of the thunderstorm after just 3 (1d6) hours of travel. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Tornado

*2nd tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 10 (5,900); DC 18/15

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Stormy skies above quickly mass together as the wind picks up. In a matter of minutes the gusts are strong enough to knock creatures over and a cyclone touches down onto the nearby ground!

**Realize Danger.** With a Nature check an adventurer knows how to stay safe in a tornado (sighting funnel clouds that will develop into new twisters, avoiding trees, protecting one�s head, crouching to avoid the wind, using ditches and gullies) and the party has advantage on Athletics checks made against it.

**Spell Solve.** A casting of *control weather* immediately ends the tornado and triggers a critical success.

**Tempest Winds.** When a creature rolls a natural 1 on an ability check against the

tornado, it makes a Strength saving throw or is thrown 200 feet, taking 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage. A creature suffers a level of fatigue when it takes 20 or more damage from being thrown by the tornado.

#### Possible Solutions

A successful group check using the following options allow the adventurers to travel across the area.

* A group Athletics check to withstand the tornado and trudge forward.
* A group Survival check to find shelter along the way and take cover, waiting a day for the storm to pass.

**Critical Failure.** Each adventurer suffers one level of fatigue and loses half of their Supply, and the party loses an extra day of travel time.

**Failure.** Each adventurer suffers one level of fatigue and loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers make it through, fighting against the winds.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers travel through the tempest unhindered. Roll twice on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

The party cannot choose to simply avoid the tornado altogether without an adventurer succeeding on a Nature check, and even then it costs them 2 (1d4) days of travel time.

### Treacherous Tundra

*2nd tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Greater (1 day)

Pristine white snow hides a multitude of hazards underneath its surface.

**Realize Danger.** With a Nature check an adventurer knows how to stay safe in

the tundra and the party has advantage on Athletics checks made against it.

**Tundra Troubles.** At the end of every hour they travel, the Narrator rolls 1d4 for each adventurer to see if they run into a hazard in this terrain. On a result of 4, roll again and refer to Table. Tundra Trouble to determine what assails them.

#### Possible Solutions

A group check can be made to overcome this challenge, including Athletics checks to quickly march through the snow or Survival checks to find paths that minimize exposure to crosswinds.

**Critical Failure.** The party takes 2 days to get across the tundra. Any adventurer that takes 20 or more cold damage suffers a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The party loses 1 day of travel time getting across the tundra and each adventurer loses 4 (1d4 + 2) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers cross the tundra in half a day�s travel.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers cross the tundra in just half a day, and they see something interesting amongst the snow and ice. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

##### TABLE: TUNDRA TROUBLES 1D6 EFFECT

***Biting Cold.*** A blustering tempest of freezing gales roils through. At the end of every hour spent traveling

1 through this area, a creature makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 5 + 2 per previous save) or it takes 3 (1d6) cold damage.

***Reduced Visibility.*** Vast amounts of snow drop down from the sky. For the next hour, the maximum range of any

sight-based senses is 10 feet. In2 addition, Perception checks are

made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

***Shifting Ice.*** The ground beneath suddenly cracks and gives way, revealing that it was ice! The adventurer makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or they fall into freezing water, taking 11 (2d10) cold damage. While submerged in the freezing

1. water the adventurer takes 11 (2d10)

cold damage at the end of each of its turns. Any creature that attempts to pull the adventurer out with a DC 17 Strength check also makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (1d10) cold damage on a failure.

***Predator.*** A creature (of a CR equal to twice the party�s average level) that is native to the area spots the

1. party and tracks them, waiting for the

next Tundra Trouble hazard before it attacks.

### Tsunami

*4th tier (weather)*

**Challenge** 17 (18,000 XP); DC 21/17

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Waves twice the height of a humanoid sweep across docks, decks, and deserted streets, but these are only meager precursors of the titanic wall of brine swelling in the distance.

**Countdown (1d6).** The adventurers have a limited amount of time to respond. At the start of each round, roll 1d6. On a result of 6 the tsunami hits.

**Don�t Run!** Nature or Survival checks reveal that outrunning a tsunami is impossible and that the best solution is to climb to safety. Those who try to run automatically fail the group check.

**Titanic Wave.** The tsunami is 10 + 2d10 feet high and thousands of feet wide.

When it hits, each creature in the area makes a Strength saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. Creatures, vehicles, and other objects are carried

1,000 (4d4 � 100) feet away and suffer two levels of fatigue.

**Up and Away.** The use of *fly*, *levitate*, or similar magic to scout ahead triggers a critical success for that adventurer.

### Possible Solutions

A successful group check using the following options allow the adventurers to endure the tsunami:

* Athletics check to climb to safety. An adventurer with a climb speed does not need to make this check.
* Engineering check to quickly create an improvised floating structure to climb on top of, or to determine whether an object will provide adequate shelter or be carried away with the water.

**Critical Failure.** In the struggle against and rush to avoid the tsunami each adventurer suffers one level of fatigue and one level of strife. Anyone also hit by the tsunami loses all of their Supply.

**Failure.** In the struggle against and rush to avoid the tsunami each adventurer suffers either one level of fatigue or one level of strife (determined by their actions and the Narrator). Anyone also hit by the tsunami loses 7 (3d4) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers survive the catastrophic wave.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers survive the catastrophic wave with little injury to speak of. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Leave It Be

The tsunami appears suddenly and the adventurers have no choice but to face it head on unless they are able to quickly teleport or take to the air along with their companions, mounts, and vehicles.

### Urban Blaze

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

Smoke rises from a building that�s ablaze with flames! The adventurers have 10 minutes to rally a response to the fire before it spreads to another building. If someone is trapped inside the building, they are incapacitated after 1 minute, dying 1 minute after that, and the challenge rating increases by 1.

**Spell Solve.** Spells that conjure or otherwise manipulate water help to dampen the blaze, granting advantage on checks made to put the fire out.

#### Possible Solutions

This is a group effort. The following three checks need to be made; each has a consequence for failure.

* + If someone is trapped inside the building an Athletics or Acrobatics check is needed to rescue them, and the rescuer makes a Constitution saving throw or they are poisoned from the smoke for 10 minutes.
  + An Engineering check (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) to protect the nearby buildings from fire.
  + An Intimidation or Persuasion check convinces passersby to help.

**Critical Failure.** Large swaths of the settlement are destroyed and the party is blamed. The adventurers have disadvantage on checks made to acquire help or information in the nearby region, regardless of the nature of the assistance or any impending threats.

**Failure.** A few nearby buildings catch on fire but the flames are quickly extinguished. Rumors of the adventurers� interference and help make people unwilling to trust them � they cannot gain expertise dice on Deception, Insight, or Persuasion checks in the nearby region.

**Success.** The building burns to the ground but no one else is harmed.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers manage to save most of the building and receive help from grateful townsfolk. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Urban Quake

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); DC 14/13

**Area** Local (special)

The buildings all around begin to shake as the ground roils and the world trembles! The earthquake lasts for 5 (1d10) minutes.

Dozens of townsfolk mill around in a panic

� can the party save them?

**Dangerous Debris.** At the end of every minute pieces of building come loose and hurtle towards the party! Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage.

**Safe Spots.** A Nature check reveals that earthquakes are more scary than dangerous, but can cause problems for buildings, and the safest place to stand is in a corner or doorway. Anyone that does so has advantage on saving throws made against Dangerous Debris.

#### Possible Solutions

If the adventurers save no townspeople, they trigger a Critical Failure. If they save fewer than 5, they trigger a failure. Saving between 5 and 10 is a success, and more than 10 is a critical success. Each check below takes one minute and saves 1d4 townspeople.

* An Engineering check (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) to brace buildings that are shaking loose.
* A Persuasion check to direct townsfolk to safety.
* A Strength (Athletics) check to physically support a precarious building.

**Critical Failure.** Dozens of townsfolk are killed and buildings destroyed.

Inflation quickly sets in, doubling the prices of goods and services in the settlement.

**Failure.** Several buildings are damaged and townsfolk injured.

**Success.** The townsfolk and their settlement survive the earthquake without much incident.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers are lauded for their heroism by grateful townsfolk who do all they can to help the party. Roll twice on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Voracious Pests

*2nd tier (creatures)*

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP); DC 17/15

**Area** Immediate (special)

The adventurers discover a horde of resilient and pervasive pests crawling throughout their supplies! These vermin aren�t just tough, they are particularly dangerous and disturbing them provokes a violent response.

#### Possible Solutions

An Animal Handling check drives the pests away from the provisions, or a Nature check locates a tastier treat to lure the pests away.

**Critical Failure.** All of the party�s food and water are ruined � each adventurer loses their entire Supply. In addition, they are attacked by 7 (2d4 + 2) swarms of rats.

**Failure.** An hour after the adventurers next consume any of their Supply, they are poisoned for 24 hours and realize the pests spoiled it. Each adventurer loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers deal with the pests without losing any Supply.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers deal with the pests without losing any Supply. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### White Elk

*2nd tier (creatures)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); DC 16/14

**Area** Immediate (special)

The party encounters a herd of elk, but one stands apart � a white bull elk with antlers that shine like crystal. The white elk is clearly wounded, an arrow sticking into its side. It looks at the party before bounding off into the woods or undergrowth.

**Arcane Lore.** Arcana check to know that the heart, blood, and antlers of this creature are highly valued by certain spellcasters.

**Divine Lore.** Religion check to recognize that white elk are a sign of divine favor and any who kill a white elk are cursed.

**Natural Lore.** Nature check to determine that this is not a natural form of albinism.

#### Possible Solutions

A success on this exploration challenge requires three ability checks. The party needs to track the elk first with a Survival check, and when they catch up with it they have to calm it with an Animal Handling check so it lets them approach, finally tending to its wounds with a Medicine check (or by using magical healing that restores at least 20 hit points).

**Critical Failure.** If the party harms the elk, divine powers curse each of the adventurers. The nature of the curses are determined by the Narrator and function as bestow curse spells cast at 9th-level. In addition, a wake of confusing energies is left behind by the white elk�s passing to obscure its trail from pursuers, making the party magically lost for 4 (1d4 + 2) days.

**Failure.** If the party does not help the elk, the weather turns bad for the remainder of their time in this region, and their next combat encounter or exploration challenge has an encounter element determined by the Narrator.

**Success.** If the party heals the elk, they earn its blessing and the next time the adventurers take a short rest they gain the benefits of a long rest.

**Critical Success.** If the party heals the elk and any of their ability checks are a

critical success, the adventurers are touched by the elk and imparted with important knowledge. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

### Wild Magic Zone

*2nd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); DC 17/15

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Whether from reasons natural or malevolent, the area ahead is a wild magic zone. Distances seem to be warped, and time seems to move in a random fashion, making progress confusing and difficult.

**Careful Casting.** An Arcana check reveals that casting using the Subtle Spell metamagic or casting spells without a vocalized component helps minimize the effect, allowing the spellcaster to roll twice on the Wild Magic Surge Table and choose which result to use.

**Incensed Fauna.** The strange magic sets beasts and monsters in the area into fits of rage and they attack the party on sight. The party has to overcome at least one random monster encounter while in the area.

**Quiet Casting.** A Performance check to cast a spell with a sufficiently quieted vocalized component allows the spellcaster to roll twice on the Wild Magic Surge table and choose which result to use.

**Wild Magic.** When a spell is cast in the area, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.

#### Possible Solutions

This task simply involves traversing the area. A group Arcana check or Wisdom saving throw is required to keep the adventurers� bearings and not get lost within the confusing warped space and time.

**Critical Failure.** The party loses 2 (1d4) days of travel time as the effects of wild magic on the environment confuse and beguile them, and each adventurer inexplicably loses 8 (2d6 + 1) Supply.

**Failure.** The adventurers lose 1 day of travel time.

**Success.** The adventurers continue unhindered.

**Critical Success.** The adventurers continue unhindered and fortune smiles upon them. Roll twice on the Boons and Discoveries table.

##### TABLE: WILD MAGIC SURGE 1D8 EFFECT

1. The spellcaster and everyone within 100 feet lose all their hair. They regrow hair at their natural rate.
2. The spellcaster must succeed on a DC 18 saving throw with a randomly determined ability or be blinded and deafened for 2 (1d4) hours.
3. The spellcaster shrinks to Tiny size for 2 (1d4) days. Their equipment does not change size, and while shrunk they have disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
4. The spellcaster and everyone within 100 feet glow for 2d12 days, producing dim light in a 10-foot radius. The color of the glow changes with their mood.
5. The spellcaster and everyone within 100 feet sneezes uncontrollably for 2d12 hours. They have disadvantage on ability checks that require speaking and are unable to cast spells that require speaking (such as suggestion) for as long as the effects last.
6. The spellcaster becomes violently flatulent for the next 2 (1d4) days, but is completely unaware of what they emanate. Checks made to track them using scent gain an expertise die.
7. The spell�s effects are doubled. Roll 1d4: on a 1, it centers its effect on the caster.
8. For the next 10 minutes the spellcaster can read minds as per the detect thoughts spell.
9. For the next 5 (2d4) hours the spellcaster and everyone within 100 feet can only speak lies.
10. The spellcaster gains (or regains) a spell slot of one level higher than the spell they just cast.

## Creating Exploration Challenges

The exploration challenges here provide a plethora of ways to make journeys impactful and memorable, but Narrators can also create new obstacles for their campaigns.

### Step 1: Start With a Problem

Come up with a problem the adventurers need to solve. When creating an exploration challenge, keep in mind that its purpose is to provide something to overcome on their journey to other, greater things (the campaign�s plot, the next big conflict, and so on). A good exploration challenge is something that the party doesn�t just react to, but can also directly apply their skills, gear, and ingenuity to overcome.

### Step 2: Add Challenge Traits

Many exploration challenges have traits that add mechanics to change the way the adventurers can interact with them or details for the party to discover. Other traits grant adventurers bonuses or penalties depending on which strategies they employ.

Also consider the size of the challenge. Exploration challenges that gradually deal damage should be large enough in area to threaten adventurers, but not big enough

that it means certain death for the party � unless it is being used to create a barrier that the PCs must circumvent or otherwise advance in level before attempting because something crucial to the campaign waits on the other side.

### Step 3: Brainstorm Solutions

The solutions provided by each encounter challenge are by no means an exhaustive list of ways around the problem, although they do suggest which approaches should be harder or easier to attempt.

Certain solutions might also have an added cost or penalty associated with them. If adventurers would rather take the time to engineer a solution to a broken bridge instead of just trying to jump over it, then that should take more time to overcome.

When an exploration challenge makes it to the table, players might present a completely unexpected solution and that�s okay! Use the existing solutions to gauge how difficult this new solution should be in the situation, and the DCs for each Challenge Rating listed in the sidebar on Setting DCs.

### Step 4: Determine the Consequences

There are usually four outcomes to consider in an exploration challenge: critical failure, failure, success, and critical success. Not every exploration challenge follows this structure, but those which are based on a group check or an individual ability check often do, and these outcomes can be applied at the Narrator�s discretion.

### Step 5: Challenge Rating and Experience

To determine the appropriate challenge rating and experience points to reward for a new exploration challenge, use the same calculations used for a new creature (averaging the DCs for ability checks and using them in place of Armor Class).

Otherwise compare the consequences of failures between the new exploration challenge and those listed in this chapter.

### Setting DCs

When creating an exploration challenge the Narrator needs to assign appropriate Difficulty Classes to any ability checks or saving throws it requires. The DCs are up to the Narrator, but as a rule of thumb for an individual check an appropriate DC to start with is 13 plus half the Challenge Rating (round down). For a group check, the DC should be 10 plus a quarter of the Challenge Rating (round down).

**TABLE: EXPLORING SOLUTION DCS**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CHALLENGE RATING** | **INDIVIDUAL CHECK** | **GROUP CHECK** |
| Less than 1 | 12 | 10 |

# Maladies

## Diseases

The rules for handling diseases are unique to each disease. Whereas one affliction might have an incubation period of several weeks, others can prove lethal within minutes. Some diseases infect only certain types of creatures or affect their hosts in different ways. While victims of disease can sometimes recover naturally, supernatural diseases often require magic to cure (such as a *lesser restoration* spell). Particularly virulent diseases might resist even magical healing. Only rare medicines or the intervention of the gods can halt such plagues.

### Treating Diseases

Treating a diseased creature over the course of a short rest with a successful Medicine check (tier 1: DC 10, tier 2: DC 14,

tier 3: DC 18, tier 4: DC 22) grants advantage on its next saving throw against the disease.

## Sample Diseases

Each of the following example diseases includes a general range of adventurers it is intended to be used against: tier 1 (1st�4th level), tier 2 (5th�10th level), tier 3

(11th�16th level), or tier 4 (17th�20th level). Narrators that want to introduce a disease above or below the party�s current tier can adjust the specifics of the disease to match their resilience and capabilities. Such adjustments might include raising or lowering the saving throw DCs of the disease, changing the disease�s symptoms, or making the disease easier (or more difficult) to cure.

### Adverse Ascension (Tier 2)

Being exposed to too much unfiltered godly glory is deadly to mortals, the simple matter

of their flesh and their paltry souls too small to contain such radiance.

The most common way to contract adverse ascension is by use of the *commune* spell, becoming afflicted once every time the caster does not receive an answer. A creature that takes radiant damage equal to triple its total Hit Dice from a celestial can also be afflicted.

Any creature overexposed to the divine makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or becomes infected with adverse ascension. In the first phase of adverse ascension the infected creature�s dreams and daydreams start featuring more of the deity�s aspects and iconography.

After 1d4 days of the disease�s first stage the infected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or proceeds to the second stage of infection, gaining a short-term mental stress effect whenever it commits an act of devotion to any other god than the one worshiped by the celestial that afflicted it. On a success, the creature recovers from the disease.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature makes a Charisma saving throw against a DC determined by infection stage (first stage DC 12, second stage DC 13, third stage DC 14). The saving throw is made with disadvantage if within the last 24 hours the infected creature witnessed divine spellcasting by any follower of the same deity as the one it is being drawn to.

On a success while suffering from the second or third stage of infection, the infected creature regresses to the previous stage of infection.

On a failure while suffering from the second stage of infection, the infected creature gains an ideal: �*All must know how great my deity is.*� This can manifest in many ways, such as muttered whispered scriptures, or as proudly trying to convert everyone around, depending on the person. The infected creature begins to show a miraculous understanding of the Outer Planes that gives it advantage on Religion checks. An infected creature that fails a second saving throw progresses to the third stage of adverse ascension.

On a failure while suffering from the third stage of infection, the infected creature can cast *shield of faith* once between rests. For the spell�s duration, the infected creature begins to gently fade into the Astral Plane as it is drawn to the divine. At the start of each of its turns, the infected creature makes death saving throws as if dying. The infected creature still acts on its turn as normal, but after three failures it dematerializes into the heavens never to be seen again. Other creatures can use the Help action to grant the infected creature advantage on these saves by speaking encouraging words to it.

After a priest of the same or a similar faith has spent 7 days in one-on-one theology seminars with the infected creature, it makes a DC 12 Charisma saving throw, curing the disease on a success.

### Arcane Autophagy (Tier 4)

Arcane autophagy occurs when the energy of a powerful spell devours the consciousness of the creature casting it.

Despite this disease�s name, mages, the servants of the gods, and champions of nature are all vulnerable to arcane autophagy.

Whenever a creature casts a 9th-level spell, roll 1d20. On a result greater than the creature�s spellcasting level, it may become afflicted with arcane autophagy. The creature makes a DC 20 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, the creature becomes infected with arcane autophagy and suffers 1 level of strife, or 2 levels on a failure by 5 or more.

Once infected, the creature repeats the saving throw each time it finishes a long rest. The creature must also repeat the save whenever it casts the spell that triggered the disease. On a failed save, the creature suffers another level of strife, or 2 levels on a failure of 5 or more.

*Lesser restoration* has no effect on arcane autophagy. A *greater restoration* spell removes 1 level of strife from the afflicted creature but does not end the disease. To fully recover, the infected creature must

purge all traces of the triggering spell from its mind. To do so, the creature must spend 24 hours without casting spells or cantrips, using class features or other abilities involving magic, or activating magic items. If these conditions are met, the next time the creature saves against the disease, it recovers on a success. A recovered creature can reduce levels of strife as normal. On a failed save, the creature�s condition worsens, although it can attempt to recover again by repeating the purging process.

### Cackle Fever (Tier 3)

Also known as �the shrieks�, cackle fever can afflict any humanoids except gnomes, who are mysteriously immune to the affliction. The disease�s symptoms include fever, disorientation, and fits of laughter that are literally contagious.

A creature infected with cackle fever suffers 1 level of fatigue 1d4 hours after contracting the disease. Until the disease is cured, the creature cannot recover from this level of fatigue. Whenever the creature experiences stress (including entering combat or taking damage), it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and is incapacitated as it cackles maniacally for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a cackling creature can repeat the saving throw to stop laughing and end the incapacitated condition.

When a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of a cackling creature, it makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it also becomes infected with cackle fever, or on a success it becomes immune to infection from that creature�s cackle fever for 24 hours.

A creature infected by cackle fever makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest. On a success, the DC of this saving throw and the saving throw to avoid a cackling fit are reduced by 1d6. The creature recovers from the disease when the DC drops to 0. If the creature fails three such saving throws

before the disease ends, it gains a long-term mental stress effect.

Gnolls are particularly susceptible to cackle fever and have disadvantage on saving throws made against the disease. However, a gnoll is not incapacitated while in the grips of a cackling fit and instead gains advantage on attack rolls.

### Delver�s Lung (Tier 1)

Delver�s lung is caused by inhaling the mold spores that often infest dungeons and other subterranean spaces. Though pernicious, delver�s lung is rarely fatal.

A beast or humanoid exposed to delver�s lung must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Whenever an infected creature takes the Dash or Sprint action, it repeats the saving throw, suffering 1 level of fatigue on a failure.

Each time an infected creature finishes a long rest, it repeats the saving throw, with advantage if the rest was completed in an environment with clean, fresh air. After succeeding on three consecutive saving throws, the disease ends. A creature that finishes a long rest on the Elemental Plane of Air automatically recovers from the disease.

### Demon Fever (Tier 2)

Ghouls native to the infernal realms carry an illness known as demon fever in their bile.

Night hags (who are immune to this disease) sometimes smear ghoul bile on their lips to infect their mortal lovers.

A humanoid exposed to demon fever must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected. Terrifying dreams plague an infected creature�s sleep.

Whenever the creature attempts to take a long rest, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or it gains no benefit from the rest.

A *protection from evil and good* or *magic circle* spell cast on an infected creature prevents the nightmares for 24 hours, allowing it to benefit from a long rest. A *heal* spell or more powerful magic permanently

cures demon fever. When afflicted by a night hag, the creature can choose to end the infection at any time.

### Fey Longings (Tier 2)

The Dreaming is a wondrous realm, so enchanting that some start to long for it without ever having been there. After any personal, intimate interaction with a fey, a creature must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be infected. Fey aware of this danger can take special precautions to prevent it using wards made from special plants and oils and though most know this, few care. Creatures with fey ancestry (such as elves, gnomes, and half-elves) are immune.

It takes 1d4 days for the symptoms of fey longings to take hold. The infected creature sees fey wherever they look. At first it�s the giggling sound of pixies just behind the next tree, but after several days it�s not uncommon for the delusions to include being surrounded by thick vines, glistening psychedelic rains, or riding a

colorfully-feathered frog (while in fact the infected creature might be tangled in ropes, showered in blood, or standing on a

swift-moving boat). While these vivid hallucinations are complete, they do not directly lead to a creature being harmed or put into harm�s way.

When the infected creature makes an opposed Deception, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion check, it makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the infected creature is charmed by one random creature it can see. This creature cannot be an ally of the infected creature. If there�s no viable target, the infected creature instead has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks as it sees and tries to interact with a world beyond the veil.

The best cure for fey longings is to bring the infected creature to the Dreaming to interact with its denizens and environment. At the end of each day spent in the Dreaming, an infected creature makes a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw to recover from the

disease. Otherwise fey longing naturally fades after 1 month.

### Fractured Rift Disorder (Tier 2)

Frequent travel beyond the Inner and Outer Planes dilutes a soul�s tether to its original plane of existence. Spells such as *plane shift* and well-made portals are generally safe, allowing for a smooth transition between dimensions, but journeying by other means can have ill effects. Whenever a creature travels between planes using a naturally occurring portal or dangerous magical item (like a *well of many worlds*), it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with fractured rift disorder.

Whenever the infected creature suffers a level of fatigue or strife, its connection to the Material Plane is tested and it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the infected creature is teleported 1d20 feet away in a random horizontal direction as its connection to the here and now shifts slightly.

Unless treated (see below) the rift continues to fracture and the infection worsens. At the end of every week during which a creature with a basic or mild infection does more than rest, it makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the disease worsens as per Table: Fractured Rift Disorder. On a success, its infection is reduced by one stage (from mild to basic, or basic to recovered).

All of this disease�s effects manifest only while on the Material Plane.

*Restoration* and similar magic have no effect on fractured rift disorder since the problem can�t be fixed with positive energy. Instead the infected creature needs to strengthen its connection to the world. A druid or similarly nature-oriented person can diagnose the disease with a DC 18 Nature check and prescribe a long-term treatment, usually requiring a month of peaceful meditation in an ancient grove or cave at

the end of which the infected creature recovers.

There are legends about living with fractured rift disorder as well, the most popular claiming that an old dwarven hero infected with it crafted a pair of magical iron boots to keep himself grounded.

**TABLE: FRACTURED RIFT DISORDER**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FRACTURE LEVEL** | **CUMULATIVE EFFECT** | **WORSENS WHEN...** |
| *Basic* | Succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save after taking a level of fatigue or strife, or teleport 1d20 feet in a random direction. | Failing a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of a week of adventuring. |
| *Mild* | Make a DC 12 Constitution Failing a DC 17 save after scoring or Constitution taking a critical hit, saving throw at teleporting 1d20 feet in a the end of a random direction on a week of  failure. adventuring. | |

| *Deadly* | When the infected creature has been targeted by a magical effect that changes its form or location within the last round and it makes a Strength check, melee attack roll, or attacks with a thrown weapon, it makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or it is transported to a random plane of existence. | � |

### Netherblight (Tier 3)

Whenever a dead humanoid is restored to life (via a *raise dead* spell, for example), roll 1d20. On a result greater than the creature�s level (or challenge rating), it may become afflicted with netherblight. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be infected.

Whenever a creature infected with netherblight finishes a long rest, it makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it gains a randomly determined malady as per Table: Netherblight. If this would result in an effect the creature already suffers from, the victim�s malady does not worsen but it has disadvantage on its next saving throw against the disease.

Only powerful magic (such as a *wish* spell), a divine miracle, or the completion of a quest determined by the Narrator can cure a creature afflicted with netherblight.

**TABLE: NETHERBLIGHT**

|  |
| --- |
| **1D6 MALADY** |
| The creature�s voice becomes flat and  1 lifeless, and it has disadvantage on Deception and Persuasion checks made to  influence living creatures. |
| The creature�s zest for life fades, and it  2 becomes unable to gain inspiration or benefit from Bardic Inspiration. |
| The creature�s type changes to undead. At  3 the Narrator�s discretion, mindless undead (such as skeletons or zombies) may ignore  the creature�s presence. |
| The gods themselves shun the creature. Whenever a spell or magical effect would  4 restore the creature�s hit points, the creature regains only half the hit points it would have normally regained. |
| The creature�s grip on life becomes tenuous  5 and it has disadvantage on death saving throws. |
| Death calls for the creature�s return. The creature gains the doomed condition, dying  6 at a time determined by the Narrator. A spell of 7th-level or higher (such as *resurrection*)  can remove the doomed condition but does not cure the disease. |

### Pastrasite (Tier 3)

This chrono-active parasite is native to Limbo, a result of the ever-shifting environment in which even time is malleable. Unfortunately pastrasites are drawn to the Material Plane where the rigid temporal structure of past, present, and future provides an excellent foundation to cling to. They are usually contracted in places of historical significance where they exist in a dormant state around the time of the event itself, looking into the future in search of visitors who have an especially interesting past�adventurers.

There�s no certainty as to what a pastrasite looks like as they can only be detected by their symptoms. They never come in contact with the infected creature itself, instead consuming the creature�s background, subsiding on the temporal backlash that results when the timeline snaps back.

When an adventurer enters an area with pastrasites they make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw as their psyche instinctively tries to maintain their personal timeline.

On a success, the pastrasite immediately retreats, choosing another adventurer to infect until there are none. For the next several hours the adventurers have advantage on Intelligence checks made to recall information.

On a failure, the adventurer becomes infected and the pastrasite immediately destroys several years of their past. The infected adventurer loses its background and gains a randomly determined background. This new background is now�and always has been�the adventurer�s past. The adventurer is vaguely aware of what happened with blurred recollection of things being somehow different than before becoming infected. Only spells that contact other planes can reveal information from the infected adventurer�s previous timeline. Most facts change as little as possible to remain consistent with the infected adventurer�s new past, but some friction remains. Whenever an inconsistency

between the old and new timelines is first spoken of in front of the infected adventurer, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

The new timeline gradually settles, and the true past can only be restored through powerful magic such as *wish*. Once a pastrasite has altered an adventurer�s timeline, although its effects remain the adventurer recovers from the disease.

Spells like *remove disease* or features like a herald�s Lay on Hands have no effect on pastrasites.

### Rotter Plague (Tier 1)

Some zombies are creations of magic but others are the spawn of an affliction known as rotter plague.

Zombies infected with rotter plague hunger for living flesh. A rotter zombie has a speed of 35 feet, advantage on initiative checks, and gain the following attack:

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d4+1) piercing damage. If the target is a living creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + the damage dealt) or be infected with rotter plague.

A living creature infected with rotter plague suffers no negative effects from the disease and cannot transmit it unless it dies. An infected creature that dies rises as a rotter zombie after 1 minute. Sprinkling the creature�s corpse with holy water or dealing it at least 1 damage prevents this transformation. A *gentle repose* spell cast on the body also prevents it from rising as a rotter zombie for the spell�s duration.

*Lesser restoration* cures rotter plague. Casting *lesser restoration* on an infected zombie removes its ability to transmit rotter plague but has no other effect.

### Scree Scale (Tier 2)

Prolonged exposure to the Elemental Plane of Earth sometimes results in the extraplanar malady known as scree scale. Though slow acting, an untreated case of scree scale can be debilitating.

A beast or humanoid exposed to scree scale must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected. After 1d10 days, an infected creature�s skin develops pebble-like growths that spread for as long as the disease persists. Every 1d10 days, the infected creature repeats the saving throw, curing itself of the disease after three successful saves. A *lesser restoration* spell also cures the disease.

An infected creature that fails the saving throw three times before the disease ends becomes a creature of living stone. In this form, the creature�s type changes to elemental, and it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that aren�t adamantine. Once scree scale has progressed to this stage, only *greater restoration* or more powerful magic can reverse the effect.

A creature of living stone repeats the saving throw every 1d10 days. On a failure, the creature becomes petrified until the disease is cured. If the infected creature makes three successful saving throws before becoming petrified, the disease�s progression halts and it remains in its living stone form until cured.

### Sewer Plague (Tier 1)

Unsanitary conditions give rise to all manner of pestilence generically referred to as sewer plague. Contact with rotting waste or stagnant water can transmit sewer plague, as can the bites of rats and other creatures that live amid such filth.

A humanoid exposed to sewer plague must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be infected. After 1d4 days, an infected creature experiences cramps and exhaustion. The creature suffers 1 level of fatigue, it recovers only half the normal amount of hit points when spending Hit Dice, and it regains no hit points upon completing a long rest.

An infected creature repeats the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest. On a failure, it suffers an additional level of fatigue. On a success, the creature instead

recovers from 1 level of fatigue. The creature is cured of this disease when it has no levels of fatigue.

### Sight Rot (Tier 1)

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted with sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected. After 24 hours, an infected creature�s vision begins to blur, imposing a �1 penalty to attack rolls and sight-based ability checks. Each time the creature finishes a long rest, the penalty worsens by 1. Once the penalty reaches �5, the creature is blind for as long as it remains diseased.

A *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic cures sight rot, as does the application of an ointment extracted from eyebright (a rare flower found in some swamps). An hour of work with a single eyebright flower and a DC 14 herbalism kit check produces one dose of the ointment. Applying the ointment to an infected creature�s eyes during a long rest prevents the disease from worsening, and three applications of the ointment cures sight rot.

### Spectral Thought-Worms (Tier 4)

Spectral thought-worms are tiny parasitic creatures native to the Astral Plane. Their preferred habitat is a conscious mind where they subside on thoughts and ideals. When a creature interacts with the Astral Plane (via the *astral projection* spell or magic item mishaps) without the protection of a *mind blank* spell, or when it suffers prolonged exposure to the less stable areas of the Astral Plane�s wild energies, roll 1d20. On a result equal to or less than its level (or CR), it may become afflicted with this disease.

Spectral thought-worms can also be carried along a *detect thoughts* spell, telepathic connections, and similar effects. A creature exposed to a spectral thought-worm or an infected creature�s mind must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be infected.

In 1d4 days the spectral thought-worm�s symptoms manifest in an infected creature. The parasite infestation spreads and they eat the infected creature�s psyche, creating a mental space into which they lay eggs. An infected creature has its memories altered (as the *modify memory* spell with no save), completely forgetting the events within 1d4 hours before and 1d4 hours after its affliction.

When an infected creature finishes a long rest, it repeats the saving throw.

On a success, the infected creature�s mind fights against the spectral thought-worms and in the resulting struggle its memory is altered, forgetting the events within the last 2d4 hours.

On a failure, the worm clears enough space to lay eggs that hatch in 1d4 days. These start eating the infected creature�s personality, reducing its Charisma by 1 at the end of each long rest. When an infected creature�s Charisma score is reduced to 0 and it dies, the spectral thought-worms escape to the Astral Plane through the tiny planar opening created by the departing soul.

Spectral thought-worms are susceptible to psychic damage (thus their penchant to hide within minds as a shield against astral energies). When an infected creature is targeted by *lesser restoration*, or takes psychic damage equal to or more than its Charisma score, the parasite goes dormant for 1 week. A dormant spectral

thought-worm is destroyed when the infected creature takes psychic damage equal to or more than its Charisma score. Upon destruction a spectral thought-worm dissolves into stray thoughts that are expelled throughout the next day as

semi-insightful sayings that float through the creature�s mind.

### Troll Pox (Tier 2)

This virulent disease originated in trolls but has since spread to other creatures. Troll pox manifests as an outbreak of boils that are rapidly replaced by tumorous growths.

Whenever a creature infected with troll pox takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, each living creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be infected. After 1d4 hours, an infected creature�s skin erupts with boils.

Though unpleasant, the initial stage of troll pox is harmless to the victim. However, each time the creature finishes a long rest, it repeats the saving throw. On a failure, the boils burst to reveal a host of fast-growing tumors. The creature�s hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). Each time the creature fails the Constitution saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced by an additional 5 (1d10) points. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

In addition, the creature gains the following trait:

**Regeneration.** The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the creature takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn�t function at the start of its next turn. The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn�t regenerate.

Infected creatures can live with troll pox for extended periods, but they never recover naturally. Only a *greater restoration* spell or similar magic can cure the disease.

## Poisons

### Poison Vectors

Poisonings must be delivered using one of four different vectors to be effective (determined by the type of poison).

**Contact.** Contact poison can be smeared on an object, weapon, or up to 3 pieces of ammunition as an action, and remain potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin is subjected to the poison. You can also use an action to splash these poisons onto a target within 5 feet of you, or throw them up to 20 feet where they shatter on impact. In either case, make a ranged weapon attack against the target, treating

the poison as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is subjected to the poison. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition.

**Ingested.** Ingested poisons are only dangerous when consumed. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. When a creature consumes a full dose of ingested poison it is subjected to the poison. If a dose is only partially consumed the creature is subjected to the poison, but it has advantage on saving throws made against the poison and only takes half of any damage the poison inflicts.

**Inhaled.** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. You can use an action to blow these poisons onto a target within 5 feet of you, or throw them up to 20 feet where they shatter and form into a 5-foot radius cloud on impact. In either case, make a ranged weapon attack against the target, treating the poison as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is subjected to the poison. Clouds of poisons formed in this way remain for 1d4 rounds or until harmlessly dispersed by a moderate or stronger wind. When a creature enters a poison cloud�s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there it is also subjected to the poison. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to these poisons.

***Injury.*** Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage. As an action you can coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to 3 pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is subjected to the poison.

A creature that is immune to the poisoned condition is also immune to the effects of any poisons it is subjected to.

### Poison Onsets

Many poisons work instantaneously but it can often take minutes, hours, or even days for foul ichors to complete their destructive work.

**Instantaneous.** When a creature is subjected to an instantaneous poison they are subjected to the poison�s effects and immediately make saving throws against it.

**Onset Duration.** Creatures subjected to a poison with an onset duration are subjected to the poison�s effects and make saving throws against it at the end of the onset duration.

### Poison Cost and Rarity

Much like magic items, each poison has a rarity (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary) and a cost in gold for a single dose. These costs and ratings are optional guidelines for the Narrator to follow for optimal gameplay, but can be adjusted to better suit a given campaign�what follows assumes that most particularly potent poisons are either hard to come by or their creation is outlawed.

### Treating Poisons

Spending 1 minute treating a poisoned creature with a successful Medicine check (DC equal to the poison�s saving throw DC) ends the poisoned condition, though the creature is not cured of any damage it has taken from the poison.

## Sample Poisons

Many of the poisons found here are the natural toxins of creatures and can be harvested directly from them using a poisoner�s kit.

### Arsenic

If a cloud of this poison is exposed to an open flame or any target within it takes fire damage, the 5-foot radius cloud is immediately dispersed as it explodes. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.

### Chuul Ichor

# Adventuring Rewards

## Experience and Other Rewards

The primary way that adventurers are rewarded is with experience points (gaining new class levels the more they accrue) and treasure like gold or magic items. These aren�t the only ways that they can advance in level however, nor the only way the Narrator can reward the party.

### Experience Points

**TABLE: CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **EXPERIENC E** | **LEVEL** | **PROFICIENCY BONUS** |
| 0 | 1st | +2 |
| 300 | 2nd | +2 |
| 900 | 3rd | +2 |
| 2,700 | 4th | +2 |
| 6,500 | 5th | +3 |
| 14,000 | 6th | +3 |
| 23,000 | 7th | +3 |
| 34,000 | 8th | +3 |
| 48,000 | 9th | +4 |
| 64,000 | 10th | +4 |
| 85,000 | 11th | +4 |
| 100,000 | 12th | +4 |
| 120,000 | 13th | +5 |
| 140,000 | 14th | +5 |
| 165,000 | 15th | +5 |
| 195,000 | 16th | +5 |
| 225,000 | 17th | +6 |
| 265,000 | 18th | +6 |
| 305,000 | 19th | +6 |
| 355,000 | 20th | +6 |

As adventurers face deadly monsters, solve puzzles, explore new locations, overcome challenges, and navigate complex social situations they earn experience points that represent the knowledge and learning they�ve gained. All characters involved in an encounter divide the experience earned evenly and apply it to their experience point total. If the party was assisted by NPCs, count any NPCs as party members when dividing.

When an adventurer accumulates an amount of experience points determined by their character level, they advance a level in their current class or may select a level in a new class if multiclassing.

After winning a combat encounter, the party gains the total experience of all monsters and encounter elements in the encounter (treating encounter elements as monsters of a CR equal to their difficulty increase) divided up by the number

of adventurers and NPCs in the party.

### Objectives

Instead of awarding experience points after each encounter, the Narrator can also award experience for completing objectives. Objectives are divided into major objectives or minor objectives. When planning an adventure, identify two or three major objectives and four to six minor objectives. For purposes of experience points, treat major objectives as hard encounters and minor objectives as easy encounters

As an option, the Narrator might ask the party to choose a major objective or a couple of minor objectives unrelated to the adventure at the beginning of each game session. This gives them some narrative control, rewards them for engaging with the story, and further ties them to the setting.

#### Major Objectives

Major objectives represent the major story beats, pivotal encounters, or significant side quests.

#### Minor Objectives

Minor objectives should represent smaller plot points, optional moments, or ancillary goals. When using a prepublished adventure, try to map them to goals rather than specific encounters. This creates flexibility in how the party accomplishes the objectives rather than dictating a specific set of encounters.

### Leveling Without Experience

Some Narrators eschew standard experience points all together, either because they find tracking it to be tedious or because it better suits a campaign�s narrative structure.

**By Session.** With session based leveling, consider having the adventurers level after each 4 hour session in tier 1, after two sessions in tier 2, after 3 sessions in tier 3, and after 4 sessions in tier 4. This system is easy to track but does not always mesh well with story beats.

**Over Time.** The Narrator may decide that the adventurers level after time passes in-game. In tier 1, PCs might level at the end of each month. In tier 2, they might level at the end of each season. In tier 3, the party might level at the end of each year. In tier 4, the adventurers might level after 2 or five years. Be sure to tie the timeframe to the narrative beats of the campaign.

**Simplified Experience.** Encounter points can also be used as an alternative to standard experience points. Whenever a party fights a battle, each adventurer gains XP equal to the encounter point cost of a battle (for example no matter their level, an easy battle is worth half a point of XP, a medium battle is worth 1 XP, a hard battle is worth 2 XP, and so on.) For every 15 XP that an adventurer accumulates they gain a level.

**Story-Based.** With story-based leveling, the adventurers level after significant accomplishments during the campaign.

### Other Rewards

The below list offers examples of rewards beyond experience points and treasure.

**Prestige.** While saving a village might not be the most lucrative of ventures, word of the party�s deeds might increase their Prestige ratings.

**Property, Assets, and Businesses.** Homes, castles, strongholds, ships, and businesses are all fine rewards that can expand adventurers� scope of operations or add a new facet to the game.

**Relationships.** Over the course of their adventure the PCs form relationships with individuals and communities. Consider granting them the use of favors.

**Room and Board.** Adventurers touch the lives of common folk and business owners. While these grateful people might lack wealth, they can ensure that heroes never go hungry or without a roof over their heads. This could grant the party a moderate lifestyle at no cost within a particular town or region.

**Secret Knowledge.** Some individuals may offer knowledge as a reward. This could take the form of a key knowledge, the location of something of interest, or an important secret.

**Services.** Religious or magical organizations might offer adventurers free or reduced cost spellcasting, and trading companies might allow PCs to travel more safely or at no cost.

**Status or Titles.** Rulers may bestow status or titles on deserving adventurers. While this can result in privileges, respect, and holdings, many rulers use this as a way to establish a hold over useful individuals.

**Supernatural Boons.** Supernatural creatures might grant some of their power to deserving adventurers. This could replicate the benefit of a magic item that does not require attunement or provide the use of a spell.

**Treasure.** Treasure covers artwork, coins, gems, and jewelry, as well as magic items.

With great risk comes great reward. Hoards of coins, glittering precious jewels, enchanted weapons, and magical trinkets await those who smite monsters or delve in forgotten labyrinths.

Adventurers earn treasure by accomplishing something notable. Dangerous adversaries, such as legendary monsters and long-standing enemies, guard treasure hoards. Allies might give rewards to the PCs in exchange for performing great deeds.

Treasure comes in two main forms: wealth (coins, gems, and salable valuables like jewelry, equipment, and art) and magic items (such as magic weapons, rings of invisibility, and so on). Treasures are physical objects. Information, allies, fame, and fulfillment of the party�s goals and ambitions are desirable, and can often be earned along with treasure, but are not treasure.

### How Much Treasure to Give?

The Narrator decides how much treasure to give out as rewards, but there is no requirement that adventurers must earn a certain amount of wealth�it depends on the style of game and scale of the campaign.

The High and Low Treasure Campaigns section below has more information on departing from default treasure levels.

The Treasure by Level table shows the rate of treasure adventurers acquire if their rewards are generated randomly or use the sample treasures given in a monster�s description. The Narrator can vary widely from these numbers without seriously affecting game balance.

The Gold Acquired This Level column indicates how much wealth, in gold pieces, a single adventurer is likely to find or earn during the course of that character level.

This accounts for their share of the coins found as well as the value of nonmagical treasure.

The Magic Items Acquired This Level column indicates the probability that an adventurer finds one or more magic items each level (roll 1d100 to determine which), and lists the treasure tables that offer appropriate magic rewards for that level.

Over the course of their career, an adventurer should find about 24 magic items: 18 consumable magic items or enchanted trinkets as well as 6 permanent magic items.

### Creating Treasure Rewards

The Narrator can give out treasure in one of three ways: crafting unique treasure rewards, rolling on the tables in this chapter to create random treasure, or granting the listed treasure for a particular encounter in a monster�s entry.

#### Crafting Unique Treasure Rewards

To determine the gold piece value of all the treasures a party finds at a given level, multiply the number of adventurers by the appropriate amount of wealth from the Gold Acquired This Level column of the treasure table above. Narrators don�t have to stick to

this number rigorously by any means�there�s enough latitude to give anywhere between twice this amount and none based on the demands of the story.

With a total gold piece value worked out, the Narrator divides it into one, two, three, or more individual treasure hoards, each a reward for overcoming a different obstacle. Instead of granting each treasure hoard in gold pieces, these can be customized by using different coin denominations, gems, and valuables of all kinds. See the Treasure Descriptions section below for inspiration.

To determine the average number of magic items found over the course of a level, multiply the number of adventurers by the percentages in the Magic Items Acquired This Level column of the Treasure by Level table. Narrators may halve or double these numbers�granting anywhere between 1 and 4 expendable magic items, and 0 and 2 permanent magic items�without straying too far from the default rate of treasure acquisition.

#### Rolling for Random Treasure

Instead of doling out parcels of treasure, many Narrators like to randomly generate wealth or adopt a hybrid random-custom method: randomly generating a hoard and then altering it by swapping out pieces of wealth and magic items appropriate to the story.

To create a random treasure hoard, use the Random Treasure Tables section on pages 178�180. On average, a typical party finds roughly 1 to 3 random treasure hoards per character level. The Narrator decides the location of each treasure. An important adversary, such as a legendary or elite monster, might guard a massive cache which consists of two random treasure hoards.

#### Using Premade Treasure

Many monter descriptions include an Encounters section listing one or more treasures, broken down by encounter difficulty. Narrators can use one of these

treasures as it stands or modify it to better fit a campaign. When using premade treasure, it�s important to remember that ***not every encounter gives out treasure!*** As with random treasure, the average party finds 1 to 3 treasures per level, and additional encounters might yield no treasure or only incidental treasure (see below).

### Varying Treasure

Whenever considering treasure, the Narrator should customize rewards to the needs of the game, the logic of the ongoing story, and the party�s desires.

#### Customizing Magic Items

Randomly assigned treasure doesn�t take into account the party�s classes or favorite weapon types. Some Narrators like to swap randomly assigned magic items for those that are more useful to their adventurers.

#### Incidental Treasure

Sometimes the party stumbles into a small amount of wealth that doesn�t constitute a treasure hoard. They might pickpocket a noble, defeat a beast in its lair, or ransack a merchant�s storeroom, but Narrators don�t need to count or keep track of incidental treasure. Grant an incidental treasure whenever it feels appropriate. When in doubt about whether incidental treasure is present (such as after defeating a minor adversary or after searching a room), roll a 1d6. On a roll of 4�6, incidental treasure is found.

To randomly determine incidental treasure, generate a treasure with a Challenge Rating of the party�s average level � 1d6 (minimum 0). A low-level party defeating a bandit sentry is likely to find a handful of silver or gold coins while tier 4 adventurers might win a few hundred platinum in a dice game�in either case, what�s gained is a fairly insignificant amount of money to the party.

#### High and Low Treasure Campaigns

When using the standard treasure rules, an adventurer finds an average of 6 or so permanent magic items over 20 character levels, along with enough money to buy a seventh, legendary item. Narrators might prefer more frequent treasure rewards and more fabulously wealthy adventurers, or to run a campaign with a lower level of magic or even no magic items at all.

Narrators that consistently grant more than double the amount of treasures per level (say, one treasure hoard per character per level) should raise the difficulty of combat encounters and exploration challenges. A well-equipped party of mid-level or higher can easily handle a steady diet of hard encounters, and probably has enough tricks to consistently succeed on medium and hard ability checks. Raise the level of challenge by including more deadly combats and more difficult obstacles to overcome, as well as encounter elements (pages 48�52).

When running a low-treasure campaign with few magic items, Narrators can expect a combat that�s rated medium to provide a stiff challenge. A combat that�s rated as a hard challenge may offer significant peril. Magic-poor adventurers don�t have as many ways to escape the consequences of failure (extra healing, teleportation, and so on), and the Narrator should design challenges with the awareness that failure is a real possibility.

#### Treasure for Large and Small Groups

The above random and pre-computed treasure guidelines assume a party consisting of 4 or 5 adventurers. Smaller parties won�t find enough treasure using these guidelines, and large parties will find too many high-level magic items. Use the following modifications to give small parties *fewer but richer* treasure hoards and large parties *more but poorer* treasure hoards.

***Crafting Unique Treasure Rewards.*** No changes are necessary to the way treasure is given or crafted, making it a great choice for unusually large or small groups. Just grant the desired amount of treasure per party member.

***Rolling for Random Treasure.*** For small parties of 2 or 3 adventurers, the PCs only find an average of 1 random treasure hoard per level. To generate each hoard, after determining the Challenge Rating of a combat encounter or quest, use the treasure table one band *higher*. For example, if a treasure�s Challenge Rating is 6 (the Treasure for Challenge Ratings 5�10 table), instead use the Treasure for Challenge Ratings 11�6 table.

For large parties (6 or more adventurers), roll on a random treasure table 3 or 4 times per level (perhaps combining two or three treasure rolls into a single monster�s hoard or quest reward). For each roll on the treasure table, after determining the Challenge Rating of a combat encounter or quest, use the treasure table one band *lower*.

For example, if a treasure�s Challenge Rating is 6 (Treasure for Challenge Ratings 5�10 table), Treasure for Challenge Ratings 3�4 table.

***Using Premade Treasure.*** Narrators can apply the same rules as for generating random treasure when using premade treasure suggestions. Small groups find around 1 hoard per level, using the treasure for the next hardest encounter, while large groups find 3 or more hoards, each of which uses treasure from the next easiest encounter. If there is no harder or easier encounter, or when using a published adventure module, instead double (for small groups) or halve (for large groups) the number of coins, gems, and valuables they find.

### Random Treasure Tables

The following tables allow Narrators to generate an appropriate treasure for a combat or noncombat challenge. There are

nine tables, each with a reward for encounters of different challenge ratings.

Some treasure hoards are won by defeating monsters in battle. To randomly determine the treasure belonging to enemy combatants, total the Challenge Ratings of all the combatants to get the treasure�s Challenge Rating.

Other treasures are discovered through exploration, given as a reward, or otherwise earned through noncombat encounters.

Quests like these can be assigned a Challenge Rating just as combat encounters can. A simple task or a small treasure has a Challenge Rating equal to the party�s average character level. A difficult or rewarding quest can have a Challenge Rating up to twice the party�s average character level.

Once a treasure�s Challenge Rating has been determined, find the matching Random Treasure Table and roll a d20 three times: once for coins, once for other wealth, and once for magic items. Each price category of gem and valuable (such as �10 gp gem� or �25 gp valuable�) has its own subtable, as does each of the random magic item tables, numbered from 1 to 10.

Caches of coins are found in denominations of pp (platinum), gp (gold), ep (electrum), sp (silver), and cp (copper). Fifty of any denomination of coins weigh 1 pound. A stack of 2,000 coins weighs 40 pounds and is considered to be one bulky item for the purposes of carrying capacity.

Each �coins� result on the treasure table lists the average number of coins found, and then in parentheses lists the dice expression used to generate a random number of coins. For instance, a result of �700 (2d6 � 100) sp� indicates that 700 silver pieces, or 2d6 � 100 silver pieces, are found.

### Other Wealth

Treasures can contain non-monetary wealth: gems and valuables. �Valuables� is a catch-all term for jewelry, works of art and craft, and other costly but nonmagical objects.

### Gems

Use the following tables to determine the specific types of gemstones found in a treasure. Most often, caches of gemstones contain only one or two types of gems.

Large, flawless, or unusually colored gems might be worth as much as ten times the usual price for their type.

### Rare Spells as Treasure

Whenever adventurers find a spell scroll, there�s a 50% chance they discover a rare version of a spell. During the course of adventuring from 1st to 20th level, the average party should find around 1 rare spell scroll per spellcaster.

### Magic Item Tables

When generating treasure hoards, use the following tables to randomly choose a magic item. The items in these tables are described in Chapter 8: Enchanted Gear.

The Narrator can customize magical treasure by choosing items instead of rolling randomly or by using items from other sources. An adventure�whether published or invented by the Narrator�may also feature unique magic items like a *+1 weapon* with a power related to the events of the adventure, or mysterious magical objects with which the adventurers can interact.

**Expendable Magic Items.** The first three magic item tables consist of expendable items like potions and scrolls, with Table: Magic Items #1 most suitable for beginning adventurers, Table: Magic Items #2 for mid-level parties, and Table: Magic Items #3 for high-level PCs.

**Enchanted Trinkets.** Table: Magic Items #4 consists of magical trinkets, which are minor items which can be given freely to characters without upsetting game balance.

**Permanent Magic Items.** Table: Magic Items #5�#10 are composed of successively more powerful permanent items. Items on Table: Magic Items #5 are appropriate for 1st level adventurers, while items on Table: Magic Items #10 are most often earned only with great difficulty by the highest-level characters.

When a roll on a treasure table calls for 3 or more expendable items, the items are often of the same type. For example, a result of 3 items on Table: Magic Items #1 might be 3 potions of healing or 3 spell scrolls which each contain a different spell.

Note that magic items marked with a C are cursed.

## Boons and Discoveries

When the adventurers overcome a great obstacle or are triumphant in the face of a difficult struggle they deserve to be rewarded. Boons and discoveries are a different way for Narrators to reward the party, and although they sometimes result in coin or an enchanted trinket, their greater purpose is to make journeys all the more memorable.

When the party gains a boon or discovery, the Narrator can invent one or roll 1d10 on the following table. Note that not all boons and discoveries are appropriate for all tiers of play, and the Narrator should reroll when a reward is too powerful (for a lower tier party) or insignificant (for higher tier adventurers).

**TABLE: BOONS AND DISCOVERIES**

### Animal

Animals which accompany the adventurers typically do so for as long as they remain in this region. The animal assists in combat, uses its senses and other abilities to aid the adventurers, and if large enough will allow the adventurers to use it as a mount. When bloodied, a boon animal flees.

The Challenge Rating of the animal is based on the region�s tier. Select one animal appropriate to the environment, or one animal per adventurer from a lower tier.

A boon animal does not generally possess intelligence greater than those of a regular animal of its type, but there is a 50% chance that an animal understands basic commands and engages in crude attempts at communication.

Flying animals such as birds are especially good at warning adventurers of impending danger, and additionally grant advantage on ability checks made to avoid being surprised.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **D10** | **BOON** |
| 1 ***Animal:*** An animal accompanies the adventurers for the rest of this region. | |
| 2 ***Blessing:*** The adventurers receive divine or local favor. | |
| 3 ***Follower:*** The adventurers gain a temporary follower who aids them in some way. | |
| 4 ***Herbs and Medicinals:*** The adventurers find some rare herbs or medicinals. | |
| ***Route:*** The adventurers discover a shortcut,  5 reducing their journey time by 1 day (to a minimum of 1 day). | |
| 6 ***Secret:*** The adventurers learn some rare or secret information. | |
| 7 ***Shelter:*** The adventurers find a cave or other location which can be used as a haven. | |
| 8 ***Supply:*** The adventurers find Supply equal to 1d4 + 1 Supply per adventurer. | |
| 9 ***Treasure:*** These discoveries are either coins, valuables, or magic items. | |
| 10 ***Other:*** Roll on the Unusual Items table (page 203). | |

The Narrator is encouraged to invent colorful or thematic ways for the animal to be introduced. Some examples follow.

* A bear cub or other young animal follows the party.
* A hunting hawk tangled in a branch because of the jesses on its legs. If freed, the party gains its loyalty.
* A flock of birds takes off and flies in an ominous pattern, accompanying the adventurers and warning of danger.
* A large feline stretches, yawns, and moves its tail aside to reveal kittens.
* Cow wearing a bell engraved with the name �Osiress, Death to all She Sees�.
* A very plump rodent is stuck in its burrow. If freed it loyally follows the party.
* The party finds well-trained mounts or labor animals (one per adventurer) appropriate to their environment such as axe

beaks in grasslands, camels in a desert, elephants in the jungle, or giant spiders in Underland, but no sign of the beasts� previous tenders. The creatures return home when released or left unmonitored.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **D1 2** | **BLESSING** |
| The adventurers discover an enchanted spring. When a creature consumes water directly from  1 the spring, for the next hour it gains advantage on Strength checks and doubles its carrying  capacity. Water that is bottled or otherwise stored for later retains this blessing for 1 hour. | |
| Spirit who wants to give the adventurers a gift. The item appears to be extremely mundane, but has an immense situational benefit (such  2 as an *arrow of dragon slaying* or waterskin with  a secret compartment holding a *potion of superior healing*). | |
| Something the party did not intend frees a trapped spirit or undoes an ancient curse,  3 granting each of them good fortune for 1 week. While an adventurer has good fortune, the next  time they roll a natural 1 on a d20 they reroll the die, expending their good fortune. | |
| The party witnesses an aurora in the night sky  4 that rejuvenates them, granting the benefits of a long rest after they complete their next short  rest. | |
| Butterflies follow the party. If an adventurer holds out a finger, a butterfly lands on it and  5 they gain an expertise die on their next saving throw. Once 1d4+1 butterflies have granted this boon the rest disappear. | |
| The next time the party uses healing magic the location around them becomes a holy site  6 infused with radiant power. The faithful begin traveling far and wide to rest at this site. Any  living creature that spends 24 hours in the area regains 2d4 hit points. | |
| One adventurer finds an important trophy or  7 trinket that grants them inspiration (though they lose the keepsake after the inspiration is used). | |
| An air elemental impressed by the party  8 lightens their burdens. Each adventurer increases their Speed by 5 feet until the next  time they finish a short or long rest. | |

* + A court of fey have been watching the adventurers from afar and are amused by their success, rewarding each of them with giant elks that are loyal mounts until the party leaves the region.

### Blessing

The gods are pleased with the party�s actions. These boons are sometimes the result of divine favor, or sometimes reflect approval of local communities.

**TABLE: BLESSING BOONS**

|  |
| --- |
| The adventurers find a book filled with stories about their quests and successes. Once per  9 week, a new paragraph appears on its pages and after reading it one PC gains an expertise  die on an ability check (whichever member of the party chooses to use it first). |
| One of the adventurers gets bitten by an insect that leaves a wound in a geometric shape  10 which won�t go away. The next time they fail a Wisdom saving throw against a spell, they succeed instead and the bite mark disappears. |
| Clouds of pollen (well known to locals) permanently stain the cuffs and hems of the  11 party�s clothing. The party gains an expertise die on Charisma checks made against people local to the area. |
| Some people that witnessed the adventurers overcome the obstacle tell everyone about it,  12 and for the next month the PCs gain an expertise die on Charisma checks made in this region. |

### Follower

| 8 | Minstrel |
| 9 | Porter |
| 10 | Sage |
| 11 | Smith |
| 12 | Squire |
| 13 | Teamster |
| 14 | Torchbearer |
| The party meets a traveling trade caravan or  15 circus which journeys with them, sharing their meals in exchange for help on the road and the  security offered in numbers. | |
| 16 | The party gains a fan who asks them for a new story or autograph or souvenir at every turn.  This might be a merchant, a young traveler, or just a commoner in a town that gets a lot of foot traffic. While the fan is with them, the adventurers� Prestige rating is increased by 1 point. |
| The ghost of a fallen traveler finds the party and haunts them, pulling harmless pranks such as blowing off their hats and scaring their pack  17 animals. Despite this, the ghost warns the party of danger and can answer questions about  the region. | |
| A friendly nature spirit takes a liking to the party and leads them towards safe paths with pleasant smells or other signs or wards them  18 away from danger with bad odors or noises. While in this region, the adventurers gain an expertise die on Survival checks made to find their way. | |
| 19 A pixie decides to tag along with the party until it gets bored. | |
| A wandering knight travels with the party for a  20 while, regaling them with stories about their heroic deeds. | |

To randomly flesh out the follower�s heritage, name, and other details, see Social Encounters on page 103. The expertise of the follower is based on the region�s tier (tier 0�1: inexperienced, tier 2�3: seasoned, tier 4: expert). A boon

follower typically remains with the party until they leave the current region.

**TABLE: HERBS AND MEDICINAL DISCOVERIES**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **D20** | **DISCOVERY** |

| 9 | 1 rare magewrist flower. When a creature uses a bonus action to inhale the flower�s magical pollen, the next spell it casts within 1 minute increases in range by one step (from self to touch, touch to short, and so on). The spell must have a casting time of 1 action. |
| 10 | 2d4 flower blossoms with healing properties. A creature can use a bonus action to eat one of the blossoms and regain 1d6 hit points. |
| 11 | 1 very rare dose of angelus root which can cure any nonmagical disease.\* |
| 12 | 1 dose of moon clovers, which undead cannot come within 10 feet of. Once picked, this plant permanently loses its efficacy in 1 week. |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 14 | 2d4 fireroots. It takes an hour to crush and prepare one of these warm, red roots, but when ingested they provide immunity to the effects of cold weather until the creature has taken a long rest. |

| 16 | A mix of rare ingredients which can be combined to make a single dose of laudanum.\* |

| 3 | Wizard�s spellbook containing either four  1st-level spells, a 1st-level spell and 3rd-level spell, two 2nd-level spells, or one 4th-level spell. These spells are chosen by the Narrator. |
| 4 | Letter containing a piece of information that would be very valuable in the right hands. |
| 5 | Old journal containing scandalous rumors about acquaintances that was written by the current governor of a local town decades ago when she was a young woman. |
| 6 | Map case containing an accurate map of an unexplored location (roll 1d4: on a 1�2 it�s a frontier map, on a 3 it�s a distant map, and on a 4 it�s a local map). There is a slit in it as if a knife was driven through it to mark a point. If the map is local, it can be used as a Route result. |
| 7 | Someone has carved a prophecy into the bark of a tree. |
| 8 | One of the adventurers receives a dream with information about an item, locale, or creature they�ve been seeking. |
| 9 | A spirit that has been bound to the area since losing its life there is finally freed and as thanks it answers one question for the party (as the divination spell but with a plain and straightforward response). |

The adventurers pick up a few basic phrases

1. of the local language if they do not already know it, making it easier for them to

communicate simple concepts.

The adventurers uncover an ancient stone carving that has a prophecy etched out in an

1. obscure language, and when deciphered it reveals something useful for their current quest.
2. The secret formula to a rare spell etched in the walls of a cave.

Before they will share their strange flame however, the constructs want their mechanical engine fueled first. |
| Single, divinely perfect and surprisingly 73�75 large feather that inspires awe in all who  see it. |
| At the end of their next long rest, each member of the party finds a playing card  76�78 in their pocket that depicts a skill or tool kit they are proficient with. An  adventurer can use a bonus action to pull out the playing card and gain an |

A cantrip counts as a 1st-level  0 spell. In addition, the living spell can cast itself a number of times equal to 10 � spell level, using the spell attack bonus or spell save DC of the adventurer that originally cast it. Until it fades away the next time the sun sets, the living spell becomes an ally of the party (controlled by the Narrator). |

# Enchanted Gear

## Magic Items

### Category

Every magic item falls into one of the following categories: armor, potion, ring, rod, scroll, staff, wand, weapon, or wondrous item. In addition, some items are more particular and use a set of general rules specific to a subcategory like gear gremlins or patron tokens.

#### Charms

Charms are magic items that can be attached to a nonmagical item (like a bracelet or necklace) or worn as an earring. A charm attached to a magic item confers no benefits unless its rarity is greater, in which case the magic item the charm is attached to confers no benefits.

#### Gear Gremlins

Gear gremlins are Tiny magical quasi-real creatures summoned through technomancy to fulfill a purpose, and each is ethereal and unable to interact with objects on the Material Plane�except for their housing items and items they were specifically designed to interact with. A gear gremlin has Armor Class 10 and 1 hit point, though it can only be damaged by creatures on the Ethereal Plane or by creatures who can specifically affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Gear gremlins have limited intelligence and can speak Common, though they typically only converse about subjects that relate to their purpose.

#### Patron Tokens

Familiars, tomes, and weapons are among the most impressive gifts otherworldly patrons grant their servants�other things are simply baubles designed to delight or

unsettle the recipient and those around them. Warlocks typically receive these tokens after completing a significant task, such as when they defeat the patron�s enemies or further its interests in the mortal realm. A servant may deliver it directly, or a gift may appear mysteriously among the warlock�s belongings while their attention is focused elsewhere. Patron tokens function only for the warlock who receives them.

### Rarity

Magic items range from small things that are surprisingly useful to potent relics of unimaginable power. The availability of a magic item, as well as its lowest and highest possible price, are determined by its rarity. More common magic items might be found among the kit of many adventurers, while rare magic items can only be afforded by successful adventurers or wealthy nobles, and legendary magic items are just that�the stuff of legends.

### Cost

Each magic item is also listed with a suggested cost for purchase, though the Narrator may choose to reduce or increase the price of any piece of enchanted gear depending on the campaign.

**TABLE: MAGIC ITEM COSTS**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RARITY** | **LOW PRICE** | **HIGH PRICE** |
| Common | 2 gp | 100 gp |
| Uncommon | 101 gp | 500 gp |
| Rare | 501 gp | 5,000 gp |
| Very Rare | 5,001 gp | 50,000 gp |
| Legendary | 50,001 gp | 500,000 gp |
| Artifact | � | � |

### Attunement

The magical properties of some magic items are locked away until they have linked to the creature bearing them, bonding the energies of both together into attunement.

Certain pieces of enchanted gear have prerequisites that must be met before they can be attuned to, such as levels in a class. In the case of monsters attuning to an item that requires levels in a spellcasting class, the monster must have spell slots and have access to the prerequisite class spell list.

Any creature able to cast one spell qualifies as a spellcaster for the purposes of attunement.

Magic items that require attunement are treated as mundane unless they are described otherwise�a magic sword is still a magic sword, but if it requires attunement it does not deal magical damage or confer its other properties until the creature wielding it has attuned to the blade.

The process of attunement requires a creature to finish a short rest where all it does is remain in physical contact with and focus upon the magic item. This could mean practicing with a magic weapon, concentrating on the details of a wondrous item, referencing arcane tomes, or praying for guidance. An interrupted short rest ruins the attempt to attune to the magic item.

Once attuned the creature intuitively knows how to activate the magic item and any command words, but not if it is cursed (or how it is cursed).

Unless it has a feature or trait that allows it, a creature can be attuned to a maximum of three magic items at a time. Attempts to attune to additional magic items fail until the creature ends one of its attunements first. In addition, it is impossible to attune to two identical items at the same time.

The most common method to end an attunement is by finishing a short rest focused on the item, but it can also be ended in the following ways: the magic item is more than 100 feet away from the creature for 24 hours, the creature no longer meets the attunement prerequisites, or the creature dies.

### Identifying Magic Items

A magic item that requires attunement can have its properties identified by a creature that attunes to it, but otherwise learning

what a piece of enchanted gear is and what it can do is the remit of learned minds or magic like the *identify* spell. Identifying a magic item is similar to the process for attuning to one and requires just as much concentration. A creature can spend a short rest inspecting a magic item, making an ability check at the end against a DC based on the magic item�s rarity (see Table: Identifying Magic Items) after searching its memories for references as it scrutinizes the magic item for clues. The type of the ability check and any skills used for it are at the Narrator�s discretion, determined by the magic item and its origins, but often include Arcana, Culture, History, Nature, or Religion. On a success, at the end of the short rest the creature recognizes what the magic item is and remembers any command words it might require. Whether or not a magic item is cursed requires a success by 10 or more.

**Recognizing Artifacts.** Extremely potent relics are literally items of myth and even when it might not be immediately recognized for what it is, the countless tales about an artifact make it easy to recognize without all of its secrets laid bare.

**TABLE: IDENTIFYING MAGIC ITEMS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **RARITY** | **CHECK DC** |
| Common | 10 |
| Uncommon | 13 |
| Rare | 16 |
| Very rare | 19 |
| Legendary | 22 |
| Artifact | Special |

#### Curses

Remember that most methods of identifying magic items, including the *identify* spell, fail to reveal an item�s cursed properties so they offer an opportunity to surprise adventurers when the curse is revealed. When describing the items, it�s important for Narrators to highlight their extraplanar

connections as the party may be justifiably wary of items with aberrant, fiendish, or otherwise questionable connections.

The curses included with certain magic items in this chapter focus on story possibilities rather than mechanical consequences, and the Narrator can choose to ignore them if their implementation would distract rather than engage the party. Likewise, these items are specific to the adventurer that acquires them and they cannot be sold (even if they were bought).

### Wearing and Wielding Magic Items

In order for a magic item to function properly it must be worn or wielded as the item intended: feet in boots, hands in gloves, heads under hats or inside helmets, fingers in rings. Magic armors and shields only work when they are donned, weapons have to be wielded, and cloaks fastened around a creature�s shoulders.

Unless noted otherwise, a worn magic item automatically stretches or shrinks to match the size and shape of the creature wearing it. When a nonhumanoid creature attempts to wear a magic item, it�s up to the Narrator whether it works or not.

#### Multiple Magic Items of the Same Type

Most creatures have only two legs and one head so usually a creature can only make use of a single pair of boots and one hat or helmet. Whether or not more than one item can be worn in the same spot is at the Narrator�s discretion.

#### Paired Magic Items

When a magic item is described as a pair, such as a pair of boots, any properties it grants only function when the full set is worn.

### Activating Magic Items

There are magic items that require a specific activation method, like speaking a command word while holding it. Each magic item�s description provides details on how it is activated, otherwise using the following rules.

Note that the Use an Item action does not apply to magic items�any item that requires an action to activate is treated as its own separate action, not the Use an Item action.

#### Charges

Magic items often have charges which must be expended to activate one or more of their properties. How many charges the magic item has is revealed either when a creature attunes to it or after a casting of the *identify* spell. In addition, when an attuned magic item regains charges the creature attuned to it knows how many charges have been regained.

#### Command Words

Command words are specific words or phrases that when spoken cause a magic item to use one of its properties. Magic items that require a command word to be spoken can�t be activated in the area of a *silence* spell or other circumstance where sound is prevented.

#### Consumables

Magic items can also be used up when activated�elixirs and potions have to be swallowed, oils applied to an item or creature�s body, arcane or divine script disappearing as it is read from a spell scroll, and so on. A consumable magic item loses its magic after being used.

#### Spells

Many magic items grant the creature using them the ability to cast one or more spells. Unless stated otherwise, a spell cast from a magic item is cast at the lowest possible

spell level, and it requires no components or spell slots. The spell uses its normal rules unless the item describes a change to how the spell functions, and if it requires concentration the creature must maintain concentration on the spell. Some magic items (like potions) simply grant the benefits of a spell, with its usual duration, without requiring the spell be cast or for the creature to concentrate.

When a magic item requires a creature to use its own spellcasting ability and it has more than one spellcasting ability, it chooses which to use. A creature without a spellcasting ability that uses such an item cannot use its proficiency bonus and it treats its spellcasting ability modifier as +0.

### Enchanted Trinkets

Trinkets are common and uncommon magic items that cost 150 gold or less. Narrators shouldn�t be afraid of rewarding the adventurers with these innocuous enchanted trinkets�they are perfectly suited for enhancing the roleplaying experience without introducing an unbalancing element to the game. Unless the party is in a metropolis known for its arcana or divinity, most shops specializing in magic items will only have a few more expensive pieces but plenty of enchanted trinkets.

## Magic Items A�Z

Each magic item is presented in alphabetical order with a description, category, rarity, and its magical properties.

### Absurdist Web

*Wondrous item, very rare (cost 11,250 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Silk of a giant spider and the soul of an ettercap

When you try to unfold this bed sheet-sized knot of spidersilk, you occasionally unearth a long-dead sparrow or a cricket that waves thanks before hopping away. It�s probably easier just to wad it up and stick it in your pocket. The interior of this ball of web is an extradimensional space equivalent to a

10-foot cube. To place things into this space you must push it into the web, so it cannot hold liquids or gasses. You can only retrieve items you know are inside, making it excellent for smuggling. Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside it. No matter how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.

A creature attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between long rests.

Any creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world.

### Aegis of the Eternal Moon

*Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement; cost 6,075 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Metal that has fallen from space

The circular surface of this gleaming silver shield is marked by dents and craters

making it reminiscent of a full moon. While holding this medium shield, you gain a magical +1 bonus to AC. This item has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each night at moonrise.

While this shield is equipped, you may expend 1 charge as an action to cast *moonbeam*, with the following exceptions: the spell manifests as a line of moonlight 10 feet long and 5 feet wide emanating from the shield, and you may move the beam by moving the shield (no action required).

When the first charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a gibbous moon and loses its magical +1 bonus to AC. When the second charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a crescent moon and becomes a light shield, granting only a +1 bonus to AC. When the final charge is expended, the shield fades away completely, leaving behind its polished silver handle. When the shield regains charges, it reforms according to how many charges it has remaining.

### Aerodite the Autumn Queen�s True Name

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 120 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Autumn leaf taken from The Dreaming

This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name �Airy Nightengale� surrounded by shifting autumn leaves.

While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this parchment to summon a vision of a powerful archfey beside you for 1 minute. Airy acts catty and dismissive but mellows with flattery. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.

You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following:

* Perform minor acts of nature magic (as *druidcraft*).
* Whisper charming words to a target creature within 5 feet.

Creatures whispered to in this way must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save targets become charmed by the vision until the end of their next turn, treating the vision and you as friendly allies.

* + Bestow a magical fly speed of 10 feet on a creature within 5 feet for as long as the vision remains.

Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Aerodite in exchange for her direct assistance. When you do so the parchment disappears in a flurry of autumn leaves, and for the next minute the figment transforms into an alluring vision of the Dreaming at a point you choose within 60 feet (as *hypnotic pattern*, save DC 13). Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Aerodite�s true name again.

### Air Charm

*Wondrous item (charm), uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Feather from a migratory bird collected on its third return home

While wearing this charm you can hold your breath for an additional 10 minutes, or you can break the charm to release its power, destroying it to activate one of the following effects.

* + Flight: Cast *fly*.
  + Float: Cast *feather fall*.
  + Whirl: Cast *whirlwind kick* (+7 spell attack bonus, spell save DC 15).

***Curse.*** Releasing the charm�s power attracts the attention of a **djinni** who seeks you out to request a favor.

### Alliance Rings

*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement; 125 gp each)*

**Crafting Components:** Matching rings worn for at least a year by a cleric and a herald

These matched glass rings shimmer from a stitch of eldritch energy that runs through their center. When you and another creature attune to the rings, you each gain the ability to sense your approximate distance from one another. You also receive a slight jolt when the other ring wearer drops to 0 hit points.

When the other ring wearer takes damage, you can use your reaction to concentrate and rotate the ring. When you do so, both you and the other ring wearer receive an image of an elderly herald giving up her life to shield her cleric companion from enemy arrows. The effect, spell, or weapon�s damage dice are rolled twice and the lower result is used. After being used in this way, the energy in each ring disappears and they both become mundane items.

### Amber Wings

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 115 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Tree sap taken from The Dreaming

This pair of amber dragonfly wings holds the memories of a native of the Dreaming who befriended several insect companions. You can speak with insects when carrying the wings in your hand or wearing them as a piece of jewelry. When you speak the name of the fey creature whose memories lie within the wings, you briefly experience the sensation of flying atop a giant dragonfly.

For 1 minute after speaking the name, you can glide up to 60 feet per round. This functions as though you have a fly speed of 60 feet, but you can only travel horizontally or on a downward slant. The wings crumble to dust after the gliding effect ends.

### Ammunition +1, +2, or +3

*Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (cost 500 gp), rare (cost 2,000 gp), or very rare (cost 8,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Naturally fallen branches from a druid�s grove

This ammunition comes in bundles of 10. When used to make a ranged weapon attack, a piece of this ammunition grants a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it: +1 (uncommon), +2 (rare), or +3 (very rare). After hitting a target, a piece of ammunition loses its magical properties.

### Amulet of Health

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Troll heart Wearing this amulet increases your Constitution score to 19. It has no effect if your Constitution is equal to greater than 19.

### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Quasit eye

You are hidden from divination magic while wearing this amulet, including any form of scrying (magical scrying sensors are unable to perceive you).

### Amulet of the Planes

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 50,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** *Scroll of plane shift* crafted by a deceased wizard

While wearing this amulet, as an action you can specify a location familiar to you on another plane of existence, making a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a success you cast the *plane shift* spell, but on a failure you and every creature and object within a 15-foot radius are magically transported to a random location determined with a d100

roll: 1�60 a random location on the specified plane; 61�100 a random plane of existence.

### Amulet of the Pleasing Bouquet

*Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Flower potpourri with petals taken from wedding bouquets and flowers laid at gravestones

Various schools of magic employ all manner of particularly foul-smelling and noxious substances, nauseating some would-be wizards to the point of illness. These enchanted amulets were created to guard against the various stenches found in their masters� laboratories and supply closets.

Enterprising apprentices quickly saw the value of peddling the enchanted trinkets to the affluent wishing to avoid the stench of the streets however, and now they are commonplace among nobility.

The most typical of these amulets look like pomanders though dozens of different styles, varieties, and scents are available for sale. While wearing it, you can spend an action and expend 1 charge from the amulet to fill your nostrils with pleasing scents for 1 hour. These scents are chosen by the amulet�s creator at the time of its crafting.

In more extreme circumstances like a *stinking cloud* spell or troglodyte�s stench, you can expend 3 charges as a reaction to gain advantage on saving throws against the dangerous smell until the end of your next turn.

The amulet has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a or 5 or less, the amulet loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.

### Angel Eyes

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 4,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Glass tempered in a Celestial Plane

Both the frame and lenses of these magnificent spectacles are made of the finest crystal. While you are wearing and attuned to the spectacles, you are immune to mental stress effects that would result from a visual encounter, you have advantage on saving throws against

sight-based fear effects, and you are immune to gaze attacks.

### Animated Shield

*Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement; cost 6,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Marilith swords, or a *scroll of animate objects*

As a bonus action, you can verbally command the shield to animate and float in your space, or to stop doing so. The shield continues to act as if you were wearing it but doesn�t require the use of a hand. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated or die. It then returns to your free hand, if you have one, or else it falls to the ground. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

### Anthology of Enhanced Radiance

*Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Assorted vegetables, bound book, bed pillow

This slightly enchanted book holds lessons for how to look healthier. When you spend 1 hour reading and memorizing the book�s lessons, after your next long rest for the following 24 hours you appear as if you�ve slept and eaten well for months. At the end of the duration, the effect ends and you are unable to benefit from this book until 28 days have passed.

### Apparatus of the Crab

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 60,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Dragon turtle shell This ingeniously crafted item (known by some as the crabaratus) is a tightly shut 500 pound iron barrel. Making a DC 20 Investigation check reveals a hidden catch which unlocks one end of the barrel�a hatch. Two Medium or smaller creatures can crawl inside where there are 10 levers in a row at the far end. Each lever is in a neutral position but can move up or down.

Use of these levers makes the barrel reconfigure to resemble a giant metal crab.

This item is a Large object with the following statistics:

##### Armor Class: 20

**Hit Points:** 200

**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (both are 0 ft. without legs and tail extended) **Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic

By repeatedly reciting the creed aloud as an action each round for 1 minute, you can cast *find familiar*, except your familiar takes the form of either an **imp** or a **quasit**.

### Armor of Invulnerability

*Armor (full plate), legendary (requires attunement; cost 70,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Scales from an ancient dragon turtle�s shell

*Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (cost 1,250 gp) or very rare (cost 5,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Lump of elemental matter corresponding to the energy resisted (air for lightning or thunder, astral for psychic, earth for acid, ethereal for force, fire for fire, lower planes for necrotic, shadow for poison, upper planes for radiant, or water for cold)

This armor grants you resistance to one type of damage. The type of damage is determined when the armor is created, from the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, thunder. A suit of light or medium *armor of resistance* is rare, and a heavy suit is very rare.

### Armor of Vulnerability

*Armor (full plate), rare (requires attunement; cost 4,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Fool�s gold and rust left over from a rust monster�s attack

This armor grants you resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The type of damage is determined when the armor is created.

**Cursed.** Once attuned to this armor, you are cursed until you are targeted by *remove curse* or similar magic; removing the armor does not end this curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to the other two damage types this armor does not protect against.

### Arrow-Catching Shield

*Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Wood from the winning bulls-eye target from a prestigious archery tournament

This shield grants you +2 to AC against ranged attacks, in addition to the shield�s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever a target within 5 feet of you is targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to make yourself the target of the attack.

### Arrow of Slaying

*Weapon (arrow), very rare (cost 8,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Piece of flint from a stream in primeval forest

A particular kind of creature is chosen when this magic arrow is created. When the *arrow of slaying* damages a creature belonging to the chosen type, heritage, or group, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving

throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Once the *arrow of slaying* deals this extra damage, it loses its magical properties.

Other types of magic ammunition exist besides arrows.

### Assassin�s Ring

*Ring, rare (cost 2,500 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** Gemstone worn by an assassination victim at the time of their death

This unassuming-looking signet ring comes with sinister features. The first is a

four-chambered extradimensional space, each of which can hold one dose of poison. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to press part of its filigree to deploy one of the poisons and apply it to a weapon or piece of ammunition. You have advantage on checks made to conceal this action from observers.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to whisper a command word that makes a garrote of shadowy force unspool from the ring. A creature grappled using this garrote has disadvantage on saving throws made to escape the grapple.

This ring�s magic is subtle and creatures have disadvantage on checks made to notice it is magical or determine its purpose.

### Assembling Armor

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 2,500 gp)*

**Crafting Component**: Plates from a damaged suit of armor that saved its wearer from a mortal blow

This thick leather belt pouch jingles softly as if filled with metal rings. This item has 6 charges and regains 1d4 each dawn.

You can use an action to speak one of three command words and expend 1 or more of the pouch�s charges, causing metal rings and plates to stream out of the pouch and assemble into a suit of armor on your body.

* Leather brigandine (1 charge)
* Half plate (2 charges)
* Full plate (3 charges)

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to speak a fourth command word and expend 1 charge to summon a medium shield from the pouch.

If you are already wearing armor that provides equal or greater protection than the armor provided by the pouch, the charges are wasted and nothing happens. If you are wearing armor that provides less protection, the assembling armor reinforces the armor you are already wearing and you benefit from the same level of protection as if you activated the pouch while unarmored. The armor remains on your person for up to 1 hour or until you use an action to dismiss it, after which it disassembles and returns to the pouch.

### Atlas to Libation

*Wondrous item, common (cost 35 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Tavern sign stolen while drunk

This golden-brown parchment has an odd handle-like wooden stave and a seal marked with an ale tankard. As a bonus action, you can break the seal and unfurl the map. When you do so, the map fills in with accurate topography in a 1-mile radius around you. A miniature image of you appears at the map�s center along with a dotted line leading to an X that marks the nearest potable alcohol. The map immediately rolls back up if brought within 50 feet of alcohol or if no alcohol is within 1 mile when the seal is opened.

Once used in this way, the seal reforms and is usable again after 24 hours.

Alternatively, you can form a cylinder with the map and grasp it by the handle as an action. If you do so, the map hardens into a tall wooden tankard and magically fills with high quality ale, then loses all magical properties and becomes a mundane object.

### Badge of Seasons

*Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** An annual flower bloomed in each of the 4 seasons

Glowing, magical symbols of spring, summer, autumn, and winter decorate this wooden badge. So long as at least one of the symbols remains on the badge, fey creatures regard you as a figure of authority. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation and Persuasion checks made to influence fey.

Whenever you create your pact weapon, you can choose to imbue it with the magic of one of the badge�s four symbols. For the next minute or until your pact weapon disappears, you gain a benefit related to the chosen symbol:

**Spring:** Whenever you use your pact weapon to damage a creature, you regain 1d4 hit points.

**Summer:** Attacks made with your pact weapon deal an additional 1d6 fire damage.

**Autumn:** Whenever you use your pact weapon to damage a creature, the target makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or it deals half damage with weapon attacks until the end of your next turn.

**Winter:** You can use a bonus action to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left each take 1d4 cold damage.

The symbol disappears after its effect ends. Once you�ve used all four symbols, the badge becomes a mundane item.

### Bag of Beans

*Wondrous item, rare (cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Dry beans and something stolen from the sack of a cloud giant

This cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans and weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean inside.

Pouring the bag�s contents on the ground creates a fiery 10-foot radius explosion. The fire ignites unattended flammable objects.

Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

You may also take a bean from the bag and plant it in dirt or sand and water it, producing an effect 1 minute later centered on the location where it was planted.

To determine the effect the Narrator may create something entirely new, choose one from Table: Bag of Beans, or roll.

### Bag of Cheese

*Wondrous item, common (cost 5 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Piece of cheese taken from a mouse trap baited with it for at least 24 hours

This item is a yellow bag with the word �cheese� embroidered on it (in Common). Any food you put in this bag becomes cheese, but retains its original taste and condition�a moldy and dirty loaf of bread becomes a moldy and dirty piece of cheese. Any non-food items develop a distinctly cheesy aroma.

Alternatively, you can turn the bag inside out, transforming it into 1 Supply worth of any type of mundane cheese.

### Bag of Devouring

*Wondrous item, very rare (cost 10,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Behir stomach This item is actually an aperture for the mouth of an immense extradimensional creature and is often mistaken for a *bag of holding*.

The creature can perceive everything placed inside the bag. Up to a cubic foot of inanimate objects can be stored inside, however once per day the creature swallows any inanimate objects inside and spews them into another plane of existence (with the Narrator deciding the plane and time of day). Animal or vegetable matter placed completely inside is instead ingested and destroyed.

When part of a creature is inside the bag (including a creature reaching a hand inside) there is a 50% chance the bag pulls it inside. A creature that ends its turn inside the bag is ingested and destroyed.

A creature inside the bag can try to escape by using an action and making a DC 15 Strength check. Creatures outside the bag can use an action to attempt to reach in and pull a creature out with a DC 20 Strength check. Would-be rescuers are subject to the same 50% chance to be pulled inside.

Piercing or tearing the item destroys it, with anything currently inside shifted to a random location on the Astral Plane.

Turning the bag inside out closes the mouth.

##### TABLE: BAG OF BEANS

|  |
| --- |
| **D100 EFFECT** |
| 5d4 toadstools with strange markings appear. When a creature eats a toadstool (raw or cooked), there is a 50% chance it  1 gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour. Otherwise the creature must succeed on a  DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. |
| 1d4 + 1 geysers erupt. Each one spews a 2�10 different liquids 30 feet into the air for 1d6  rounds: beer, berry juice, cooking oil, tea,  vinegar, water, or wine. |
| A fully developed treant appears. There is a 11�20 50% chance it is chaotic evil, in which case it immediately attacks the nearest creature. |
| A stone statue in your likeness with an angry countenance rises. The statue is immobile except for its mouth, which can move and speak. It constantly rails threats and insults against you. If you leave the statue, it knows where you are (if you are on the same plane of existence) and tells  21�30 anyone who comes near that you are the worst of villains, urging them to kill you. The  statue attempts to cast *geas* (save DC 10) on any nearby creature that can speak a language you do (and isn�t your friend or companion) with the command to find and kill you. After 24 hours, the statue loses the ability to speak and cast *geas*, becoming completely inanimate. |
| A campfire with green flames appears for 31�40 24 hours or until it is extinguished. The area  in a 10-foot radius is a haven (see page 57  in Chapter 4: Exploration). |
| 41�50 1d6+6 fully developed shriekers appear. |
| 1d4+8 small pods sprout, which then unfurl to allow a luminescent pink toad to crawl out of each one. A toad transforms into a  51�60 Large or smaller beast (determined by the Narrator) whenever touched. The beast remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of luminescent pink smoke. |
| A fully developed shambling mound appears. It is not hostile but appears  61�70 perplexed as it is stunned for 1d4 rounds. Once the stun effect ends, it is frightened for 1d10+1 rounds. The source of its fear is |

|  |
| --- |
| one randomly determined creature it can see. |
| A tree with tantalizing fruit appears, but 71�80 then turns into glass that refracts light in a  dazzlingly beautiful manner. The glass tree  evaporates over the next 24 hours. |
| A nest appears containing 1d4+3 vibrantly multicolored eggs with equally multicolored yolks. Any creature that eats an egg (raw or cooked) makes a DC 20 Constitution  81�90 saving throw. On a success, the creature�s lowest ability score permanently increases  by 1 (randomly choosing among equally low scores). On a failure, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. |
| A 5-foot hole with swirling multicolored vapors inside appears. All creatures within 10 feet of the hole that have an Intelligence of 6 or higher hear urgent, loving whispers from within in a language they understand. Each creature makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or try to leap into the hole.  The first creature to jump into the hole (or 91�99 more than one, if multiple creatures jump in  simultaneously) disappears for 1 day before  reappearing. A creature has no memory of the previous 24 hours when it reappears, but finds a new randomly determined magic item of uncommon rarity among its possessions. It also gains the benefits of a long rest. The hole disappears after 1 minute, or as soon as a creature jumps completely into it. |
| A fantastic, gargantuan beanstalk erupts and grows to a height determined by the Narrator. The Narrator also chooses where  100 the top leads. These options (and more) are possible: the castle of a giant, a magnificent view, a different plane of existence. |

### Bag of Holding

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** Phase spider silk This bag�s interior space is larger than its apparent size of roughly 2 feet wide and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds and has an internal volume of 64 cubic feet. No matter what it contains, it weighs 15 pounds. Retrieving an item from

the bag requires an action. If you have never interacted with a specific bag of holding before, the first time you use it, it requires 1d4 rounds to take stock of its contents before anything can be retrieved from the bag.

Food or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities�after being in the bag, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored to life by *revivify, raise dead,* or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

The bag cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky quality.

If the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane.

Placing a *bag of holding* inside another extradimensional storage device such as a *portable hole* or *handy haversack* results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.

### Bag of Tricks

*Wondrous item, uncommon or rare (varies)*

**Crafting Component:** Ball of shed chimera fur or a molted owlbear feather

This seemingly empty cloth bag comes in several colors and has a small, furry sphere inside.

You can use an action to pull the sphere from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet.

Upon landing, it becomes a creature determined by a roll on the Bag of Tricks table (depending on the bag�s color).

The resulting creature is friendly to you and any companions you have. It acts on your turn, during which you can use a bonus action to give it simple commands such as �*attack that creature*� or �*move over there*�.

If the creature dies or if you use the bag again, the creature disappears without a trace. After the first use each day, there is a 50% chance that a creature from the bag is hostile instead of friendly and obedient.

Once you have used the bag three times, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.

*Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Talons of a fiend The hand on which you wear this bracelet transforms into a claw covered with a dozen wicked spines. Your unarmed attacks with the claw deal 1d6 piercing damage, and you gain an expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks made to steal small items. Your hand returns to normal if you remove the bracelet.

As an action, you can draw upon the claw�s magic to cast *produce flame*.

Whenever you use the claw in this way, one of the bracelet�s spines disappears and your hit point maximum is reduced by 1d8. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. If this effect reduces your hit point maximum to 0, you die and your body permanently transforms into a barbed devil. When the bracelet has no more spines it becomes a mundane item.

### Barrow Bread

*Wondrous item, common (cost 2 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Rock salt licked by a basilisk

Barrow bread is made from mashing together plantains and starches that are grown in tropical barrows. While this viscous, starchy paste is not actually a bread, it perfectly preserves and maintains the temperature of any food tucked inside it for up to a week, protecting and preserving 1 Supply. The magic is contained in the plantain leaves that are wrapped around the barrow bread. Once unwrapped, the barrow bread itself can be consumed (as 1 Supply) within 15 minutes before the outside elements spoil it.

### Bead of Force

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 3,000 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** Dust from the Astral Plane or a pocket dimension

This �-inch diameter sphere of black glass can be thrown up to 60 feet as an action.

On impact it creates an explosion in a

10-foot radius area centered on the bead. Creatures in the area make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 force damage on a failure. A sphere of force then surrounds the same area for 1 minute. Any creature that is completely in the area is trapped inside the sphere if it failed its saving throw. Otherwise, it is pushed away from the point of impact until it is outside the sphere.

The wall of the sphere only allows air to pass, stopping all other attacks and effects. A creature inside the sphere can use its action to push against the sides of the sphere, moving up to half its Speed. The sphere only weighs 1 pound if lifted, regardless of the weight of the creatures inside.

### Bead of Tracking

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement;*

*cost 200 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Hide of an insect from the Dreaming

This miniature bead is covered with hundreds of small hooks. When you use an action to place it on a creature�s clothing or hide, the bead hangs there imperceptibly and creates a bond between you and the creature. You gain an expertise die on checks made to track the creature while the bead remains on it. To place the bead during combat without being noticed, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the creature�s maneuver DC (or when outside of combat, the creature�s passive Perception).

*cost varies)*

**Crafting Components:** Braided rope made of hair from the same kind of giant as the belt to be made

***Curse.*** After you attune to this axe you are unwilling to let it out of your reach. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one unless the nearest foe you are aware of is 60 feet or more away from you.

In addition, when you are damaged by a hostile creature you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, on your turn each

round you move to the nearest creature and take the Attack action against it, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you incapacitate your current target.

When the whistle is blown the sounds of songbirds are heard by all creatures in a 100-foot radius. These calls are indistinguishable from actual birds singing.

Alternatively, you can use an action to break the whistle to summon a large flock of birds that appear at the start of your next turn and surround you in a 10-foot radius.

The flock moves with you and makes you heavily obscured from creatures more than 10 feet away for 1 minute, or until the flock takes 10 or more damage from area effects.

### Blackbird Pie

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Feather from the Dreaming

This item appears to be a freshly baked pie in a tin. When the crust is fully punctured the pie explodes as 24 magic blackbirds fly out and flit through the air in a 20-foot radius for 2d4 rounds, at which point the birds and the pie disappear. A creature that starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on its turn makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1 slashing damage on a failure. A creature damaged by the blackbirds has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the beginning of its next turn. The blackbirds are magical and

cannot be interacted with like normal animals, and attacking them has no effect.

### Book of Storing

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 350 gp; requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Beautiful leather bound tome, scroll of *major image*

After you attune to this 1-foot square 6-inch thick book it hides its true nature to anybody else, appearing to be a mundane diary.

When you open it, however, the book reveals a Tiny storage compartment.

The storage space is the same size as the book, and because this item doesn�t function as a pocket dimension it can be safely used to store items such as a *portable hole*.

While wearing these boots, you can use a bonus action to click the heels together. You double your Speed, and opportunity attacks

made against you have disadvantage. You can end the effect as a bonus action.

Once the boots have been used in this way for a total of 10 minutes (each use expends a minimum of 1 minute), they cease to function until you finish a long rest.

### Boots of Striding and Springing

A neat strap of embossed leather, the borrower�s bookmark can be placed in a book, allowing it to be stored in an extradimensional space. As an action you can send the book into a pocket dimension. While it is in the pocket dimension, you can use an action to summon it to your hand or an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you unattune from the bookmark while its book is within the pocket dimension, the bookmark reappears on your person, but the book is lost. The bookmark�s magic can�t be used to store anything other than a book.

**Curse.** The borrower�s bookmark is cursed. Books dismissed to the pocket dimension are sent to a powerful entity�s lair. The entity learns all the knowledge contained therein, as well as your identity and location.

### Bottle of Fizz

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 350 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Ruby, ember from the Plane of Fire

When found this thick glass bottle has 25 (5d10) small red rocks inside. You can use an action to throw a red rock to the ground to create a spectacular fireworks show that lasts for 1 round. The fireworks cast bright light for 50 feet and dim light for a further 30 feet, and they can be heard up to 200 feet away.

### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

### Box of Bees

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 110 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Queen bee from a hive that has persisted for at least 5 years

Many apprentices play pranks on one another, some of which can be quite painful�the *box of bees* is a particularly popular example and now sold by those with their own mischievous designs. Each of these wooden boxes is rectangular and approximately 2 inches long. It is usually unadorned, though some boxes seem to have something moving or vibrating inside.

When you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the lid slides open and a bee erupts out of the box to harass a creature of your choice within 20 feet. A creature harassed by the bee must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature makes its next attack roll or ability check with disadvantage.

When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, a dozen or more bees swarm out of the box and attack. A creature attacked by the bees must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature takes 1 point of damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 round.

The box has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the box loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.

### Box of Party Tricks

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)* **Crafting Components:** Pearls, tears of a puppet master

| 5 For the next 1d6 hours your voice becomes higher by an octave. |
| 6 Until the next dawn you leave a trail of wildflowers wherever you walk. |

You can send the broom up to 1 mile from you by speaking its command word and naming a location you are familiar with. It can also be called back from up to a mile away with a different command word.

### Bubble Wand

*Wand, uncommon (cost 120 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Perfectly spherical frozen soap bubble

This slender timber wand has a wooden ring at its tip. The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into a spray of colorful bubbles and is lost forever.

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend its charges and either create a harmless spray of colorful bubbles (1 charge) or cast the *dancing lights* cantrip (2 charges). The *dancing lights* appear as glowing bubbles.

When a creature targets you with an attack while you are holding the wand, you can use your reaction to snap it (destroying the wand). You can do this after the roll is made, but before the outcome of the attack is determined. You gain a +5 bonus to AC and a fly speed of 10 feet as a giant soap bubble coalesces around you. The bubble persists for 1 minute or until you are hit with an attack, at which point it bursts with a loud �pop�.

### Cage of Folly

*Wondrous item, common, (requires attunement; cost 75 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Remains of a magic item whose crafting check was failed

This small silver or gold birdcage traps your bad ideas and puts them on display. When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, a little piece of a mechanical bird materializes inside the cage: first the feet, then legs, body, wings, and head. You can immediately reconsider and reroll the ability check. The *cage of folly* can be used once every 24 hours, and recharges at the end of each week.

Once you have used the birdcage 5 times, the bird sings a mocking song for 1 hour when you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check. If you open the birdcage and let the bird go free, it gives you one

piece of good advice about a current problem or question that you face. At the Narrator�s discretion, the advice may give you advantage on one ability check made in the next week. Afterward it flies away as the birdcage loses its magic and becomes a mundane item (though some who have released their birds claim to have encountered them again in the wilds later.)

### Candle of Invocation

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 50,000 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** Blood from a divine servant such as an angel or fiend

This golden candle is infused with raw divine magic. When attuned to by a cleric or druid, it takes on a color appropriate to the cleric�s deity.

You can use an action to light the candle and activate its magic, shedding dim light in a 30-foot radius. The candle can burn for a total of 4 hours in 1 minute increments before being used up.

Any creature within the area of the candle�s light who worships the same deity as the attuned creature (or at the Narrator�s discretion, an allied deity) has advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. If such a creature is also a cleric, druid, or herald, they can cast 1st-level spells from one of those classes at that spell level without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, one of these candles that has not yet been lit can be used to cast the *gate* spell. Doing so consumes the candle.

### Scholar

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Wax harvested from bees fed lavender nectar

Initially crafted by wizard apprentices trying not to irritate their roommates, these candles became extremely popular with the thieves and other ne�er-do-wells that can afford them (helping some less scrupulous novice mages to afford tuition). The candle has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.

When you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the candle�s flame springs to life. Its bluish flame provides bright light within 5 feet and dim light for another 5 feet. The enchantment of the candle is such that the light that it sheds is visible only to you. Each charge is good for 1 hour of illumination, after which the candle winks out.

By expending all 3 charges at once, you can create an effect identical to *light* except that only you are able to see the light it sheds.

If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the candle loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.

### Cantrip Wand

*Wand, uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Scroll of the cantrip to be imbued and a branch from a treant or awakened tree

This wand can be used as a spellcasting focus and allows you to cast one additional cantrip as if you knew it, as long as it is on your spell list. Each cantrip wand has a cantrip imbued within it upon creation, and will be known by its name (such as a *fire bolt wand* or *light wand*).

Other implements exist for the storing of cantrips from other classes (like *cantrip holy symbols* or *cantrip instruments*), and though these are wondrous items they function like wands.

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 2,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Brimstone from the lower planes

While wearing this cape, you can use an action to cast *dimension door* once between long rests. You disappear and reappear in a cloud of smoke which dissipates at the end of your next turn, or sooner if conditions are windy.

### Carpet of Flying

*Wondrous item, very rare (cost varies; see table)*

**Crafting Component**: Thread spun on the top of a mountain

You can use an action to speak this carpet�s command word, making it hover and fly. It moves according to your verbal commands as long as you are within 30 feet of it.

These carpets come in four sizes. The Narrator can choose or randomly determine which size a given carpet is.

If the carpet is carrying half its capacity or less, its Speed is doubled.

**TABLE: CARPET OF FLYING**

|  |  |  |  |  |

**Crafting Components:** Forged document that passed bureaucratic scrutiny

As an action, you can expend 1 charge from this charcoal stick to draw an X on one object up to the size of a normal door. This has no effect on creatures, or objects worn by creatures. Creatures other than you that see the marked object roll a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, they do not notice the marked object as anything out of the ordinary from its surroundings. On a success, they can interact with the object normally. A creature that remains in the area and is consciously searching for the kind of object that you have marked receives a new saving throw at the end of each minute. A creature interacting with a marked object automatically reveals it to all creatures who observe the interaction. A charcoal mark lasts for 24 hours or until it is wiped away as an action.

Alternatively, you can expend 2 charges to increase the DC to notice the object to 15.

The charcoal has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk. If you expend the last charge, the charcoal is consumed.

### Chime of Opening

*Wondrous item, rare (cost 750 gp)* **Crafting Component:** Key from a decommissioned prison

You can use an action to strike this foot-long metal chime while pointing it at an openable object within 120 feet. One lock or other fastening on the object opens if the sound can reach the object.

### Cloak of Displacement

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** The breath of an invisible stalker

This cloak creates a visual illusion that distorts your position. Attack rolls against you have disadvantage unless the attacker does not rely on sight. When you take damage, this property stops until the start of your next turn, and it is otherwise negated if you are incapacitated, restrained, or unable to move.

### Cloak of Elvenkind

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Leaves and bark from an awakened tree

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, its color changes to camouflage you. While camouflaged, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide and creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you. You can use an action to put the hood up or down.

### Cloak of Protection

* A fly speed of 40 feet while gripping the edges of the cloak with both hands.
* Once between long rests you can use an action to cast *polymorph* on yourself, transforming into a bat. You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.

### Cloak of the Manta Ray

Shadows writhe underneath this dark cloak. While attuned to and wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light or darkness.

In addition, you can use an action to animate your shadow for up to 1 hour. While it is animated, you can see and hear through your shadow�s senses and control it telepathically. If your shadow is slain while animated, your shadow disappears until the new moon, during which time the cloak becomes nonmagical. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.

### Clockwork Calendar

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** 4 bronze clockwork gears, each one forged during a different season

A circular disk of dozens of interlocking gears almost a foot in diameter, upon first examination this device is unfathomably complex. The gears are covered with runes that appear to be a much older form of Dwarvish script. Rotating some of the raised gears causes this apparatus to slowly tick through a series of symbols that seem to correspond to astrological signs.

To understand how to operate the *clockwork calendar*, you must carefully study the device and turn the gears through their myriad configurations. After 1 hour you

can make a DC 16 Investigation or Arcana check. On a failure, you cannot reach a conclusion regarding how to interpret the intended function of the calendar. On a success, you understand how to utilize the device as indicated below. Casting *identify* on the calendar reveals a moderate aura of divination magic but provides no information on how to use this complex object.

Once you know how the *clockwork calendar* functions, you can adjust the dials to display the current day of the year for the geographical region of the world you are located in (this property does not function outside of the Material Plane). The exposed faces of the gears composing the calendar display the position of the stars in the sky and the dials can be adjusted throughout the day or night to continue to track their position. The calendar can also be adjusted to any past or future dates and times to ascertain the position of any of the celestial objects visible in the night sky.

Additionally, you can use a bonus action to smash the *clockwork calendar* and destroy it, gaining the benefits of the *haste* spell until the end of your next turn.

If you spend a short or long rest writing your most secret thoughts in the journal,

you can choose to gain Inspiration instead of regaining expended Pact Magic spell slots. The seventh time you gain Inspiration in this way, you fill the journal�s pages and can�t write in it again.

### Contract of Indentured Service

*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; purchase of the debt for 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Binding contracts of service signed in good faith

Necromancers occasionally act as apparent benefactors, offering loans to victims now in exchange for service after death. This contract details an account of a spirit that has become indentured to the contract�s holder. While holding the contract, you can speak the command word as an action to summon the invisible undead spirit, which functions as the spell *unseen servant*. You can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Alternatively, you can use an action to tear up the contract and release the undead spirit. The spirit appears as a friendly specter you can telepathically command (as a bonus action) for as long as you maintain concentration. The specter acts immediately after your turn. If your concentration is broken, the specter attacks you and your companions. Otherwise the specter disappears 10 minutes after it is summoned, vanishing to whichever afterlife awaits it.

### Cord of Spirit Stealing

*Wondrous item, rare (cost 1,250 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** An item that has been used to kill a sapient creature

This leather cord is the color of stained blood and feels slightly moist. When wrapped around the handle of a melee weapon, the cord captures some of the energy of any sapient creature the weapon is used to kill. When you reduce a hostile sapient creature to 0 hit points, the cord gains 1 charge (to a maximum of 5). You can use a bonus action to spend 1 charge

from the cord to cast *false life*, or expend more additional charges to increase the spell�s level to the number of charges expended.

### Crystal Ball

*Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement; 50,000 gp or 150,000 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** Solid, silver-laced crystal ball (rare) or stone from an aligned plane (legendary)

A typical enchanted *crystal ball* can be used to cast the *scrying* spell (save DC 17) once between short rests while touching it.

Three legendary variations exist. In all cases, the legendary variants have an alignment (Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful). If you do not have an alignment trait that matches the *crystal ball*�s, after using it you take 6d6 psychic damage and gain a level of strife.

**Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.** You can use an action to cast *detect thoughts* (save DC 17) on a creature within 30 feet of the spell�s sensor. This effect does not require concentration, but it ends when the *scrying* does.

**Crystal Ball of Telepathy.** While the *scrying* is active, you can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of the spell�s sensor, and you can use an action to cast *suggestion* (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of them. This effect does not require concentration, but it ends when the *scrying* does.

**Crystal Ball of True Seeing.** In addition to the normal benefits of scrying, you gain truesight through the spell�s sensor out to a range of 120 feet.

### Cube of Force

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 4,000 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** Adamantine cube This inch-long cube has a recessed button with a distinct marking on each face. It starts with 36 charges and regains 1d20 of them at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the buttons, expending charges as shown on the Cube of Force table. If the cube has insufficient charges, nothing happens.

Otherwise, the cube creates a 15-foot cube of force that is centered on you and moves with you. It lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press another button, or the cube�s charges are depleted.

You can change the cube�s effect by pressing a different button. Doing so expends the requisite number of charges and resets the duration.

If moving causes the cube to come into contact with a solid object that can�t pass through the cube, you cannot move any closer to that object while the cube is active.

The cube loses charges when targeted by effects from the following spells or magic items: *disintegrate* (1d12 charges), *horn of blasting* (1d10 charges), *passwall* (1d6 charges), *prismatic spray* (1d20 charges), *wall of fire* (1d4 charges).

### Cubic Gate

*Wondrous item, legendary (cost 250,000 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** Metal from each of the six planes on the cube

This 3-inch cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. Each side of the cube is keyed to a different plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The other five sides are determined by the Narrator.

As an action, you may press one side of the cube and spend a charge to cast the *gate* spell, opening a portal to the associated plane. You may instead press a side twice, expending 2 charges and casting *plane shift* (save DC 17) which sends the targets to the associated plane.

### Culdarath the Ninth Ring�s True Name

*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; cost 70 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Parchment charred on the Plane of Fire

This charred parchment slip contains the magically bound name �Ozzacath�ta Culd.� While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke this name to summon a vision of a powerful efreet beside you for 1 minute. Ozzacath is haughty and impatient but seems to relish the chance to burn anything. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.

You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following:

* Light a bonfire, candle, or similar flammable object within 15 feet.
* Burn brightly (or cease burning brightly) for the next minute, providing bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for a further 15 feet.
* Translate up to 25 words of spoken or written Ignan into Common.

Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Culdarath in exchange for his direct assistance. When you do so the parchment burns to cinders and for the next minute the vision roars into a ball of fire within 5 feet of you (as *flaming sphere*, save DC 13). On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally indicate where the ball of fire moves. Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Culdarath�s true name again.

### Cunning Tools

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Silver worked only by the light of the full moon

### Dagger of Venom

*Weapon (dagger), rare (cost 2,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Mushrooms gathered from a mummy�s tomb

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic blade. In addition, once each dawn you can use an action to poison the dagger�s blade for 1 minute or until it is used to damage a creature. When a creature is damaged by the blade�s poison, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute.

### Dancing Sword

*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement; cost 8,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Fey-crafted instrument

While you are attuned to this magic sword, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word and throw it into the air. The sword hovers, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it (using your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls). On each of your turns you can use a bonus action to make the sword fly up to 30 feet to attack another creature within 5 feet of it.

After the sword attacks for the fourth time, it tries to return to your hand. It flies 30 feet towards you, moving as close as it can before either being caught in your free hand or falling to the ground.

The sword ceases to hover if you move more than 30 feet away from it or grasp it.

### Death�s Essence Pendant

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Humanoid remains, pearl

This small black pendant has 5 charges and regains 1d4 charges each day at dawn. You can use an action and expend a charge to make undead of CR 1 or lower indifferent to you and creatures you choose within 30 feet of you. Undead remain indifferent until you for up to 1 hour, or until you threaten or harm them. Three times each day you can use a bonus action and expend a charge to summon a **skeleton** (page 334 or **zombie** (page 335). Your summoned creature follows you and is hostile to creatures that are hostile to you. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete. Undead created by the pendant turn into dust at dawn.

### Decanter of Endless Water

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 450 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** water elemental mote

This flask sloshes when shaken as if full of water. You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak a command word, causing undrinkable water to flow out of the flask. It stops at the start of your next turn.

**Stream.** This command word produces 1 gallon of water.

**Fountain.** This command word produces 5 gallons of water.

**Geyser.** This command word produces 30 gallons of water that manifests as a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action, you can aim the geyser at a target within 30 feet, forcing it to succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Any object less than 200 pounds is knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away.

### Deck of Illusions

*Wondrous item, uncommon (500 gp)*

**Crafting Component:** paper made by the fey

This box houses a set of 34 illustrated cards when new. A found deck is typically missing 1d20 cards.

As an action, you can draw a random card (one manually selected does nothing) and throw it up to 30 feet from you.

Upon landing, the card creates an illusion of one or more creatures. These illusions are of normal size for the creatures depicted and act normally, but are insubstantial and harmless. While you are within 120 feet of the illusion, you can use an action to move it anywhere within 30 feet from its card.

The illusions are revealed to a creature when it uses an action to make a DC 15 Investigation check or automatically upon any physical interaction. Once revealed, an illusion becomes translucent.

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or it is dispelled. In either case the card disappears and cannot be reused.

### Deck of Many Things

*Wondrous item, legendary (cost 100,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Deck of cards touched by a god or goddess of luck and essence from a chaotic plane

Most *Decks of Many Things* have only 13 cards, but some have 22. The Narrator may decide, or roll 1d4 to determine randomly (a partial deck on a 1�3, or a full deck on a 4).

Before drawing, you must declare the number of cards that you intend to draw. A modified poker deck can be used to create your own physical deck using the substitutions below. A card�s magic takes effect as soon as it is drawn. Once you begin drawing, each subsequent card must be drawn within an hour of the card that came before it. Failure to do so causes all of your remaining draws to take effect immediately. Once a card is drawn, if it is not a joker it is reshuffled into the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

Once you have drawn the number of cards that you�ve declared, the deck resets and you may never draw from that deck again. Once all individuals present when the deck is discovered have drawn their cards, roll 1d4. On a 1�3 the deck vanishes, or on a 4 it returns to its coffer, allowing you to transport it should you so choose.

The Balance, Comet, Donjon, Fates, Fool, Gem, Idiot, Talons, and Vizier cards only appear in the 22 card deck.

**? Ace of Clubs: Talons.** Every magical item that you own is immediately destroyed. Artifacts are not destroyed and are instead cast into the multiverse.

**? King of Clubs: Void.** Your soul is trapped in an object in a location of the Narrator�s choosing where it is guarded by powerful beings. While your soul is trapped, your body is incapacitated. A wish cannot restore your soul, but it can reveal its location. Any remaining draws from the deck are lost.

**? Queen of Clubs: Flames.** You gain the enmity of a powerful devil. It seeks to destroy you along with all that you love or

have built, inflicting as much misery upon you and your loved ones as possible before finally slaying you. This antagonism lasts until either you or the devil perish.

**? Jack of Clubs: Skull.** A harbinger of death appears and attempts to slay you. The harbinger appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet and immediately attacks. A sense of mortal dread fills any allies present, warning them to stay away. The harbinger fights until you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. It cannot be harmed by anyone other than you, and if anyone other than you attempts to harm it, another harbinger of death is summoned for them. Creatures slain by a harbinger cannot be restored to life by any means.

**? Two of Clubs: Idiot.** Your Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 1d4 + 1, to a minimum of 1. You may draw one additional card beyond what you declared.

* **Ace of Diamonds: Vizier.** At any point within a year of drawing this card, you may ask a question and immediately receive a truthful answer that helps you to solve a problem or dilemma as well as the wisdom and the knowledge to apply it.
* **King of Diamonds: Sun.** You gain 50,000 XP, and a randomly determined wondrous item appears in your hands.
* **Queen of Diamonds: Moon.** You are granted 1d3 wishes (as the *wish* spell).
* **Jack of Diamonds: Star.** Increase an ability score of your choice by 2. The score cannot exceed 24.
* **Two of Diamonds: Comet.** Defeating the next hostile monster or group alone will grant you enough experience points to advance to the next level.

**? Ace of Hearts: Fates.** You are granted the ability to circumvent or erase a single event as though it had never happened. You may use this ability immediately upon drawing the card or at any point prior to your death.

**? King of Hearts: Throne.** You are granted proficiency in the Persuasion skill and gain a 1d6 expertise die on all

Charisma (Persuasion) checks. You are also granted legal domain over a small keep or fortress on the plane that your character inhabits. Your new domain is overrun by monsters and must be liberated before it can be inhabited.

**? Queen of Hearts: Key.** A magic weapon of at least rare rarity that you are proficient with appears in your hand. The weapon is chosen by the Narrator.

**? Jack of Hearts: Knight.** A veteran appears and offers you their loyal service until death, believing it to be destiny. You control this character.

**? Two of Hearts: Gem.** You are showered in wealth. A total of 25 trinkets, easily portable pieces of art, or jewelry worth 2,000 gold each, or 50 gems worth 1,000 gold each appear directly in front of you.

**? Ace of Spades: Donjon.** You vanish and are trapped in an extradimensional space. You are either unconscious in a sphere (50%) or trapped in a nightmare realm drawn from your own experiences and fears (50%). You remain in your prison until you are freed. While divination magics cannot locate you, a *wish* spell reveals the location of your prison. You cannot draw any more cards.

**? King of Spades: Ruin.** All nonmagical wealth that you own is lost. Material items vanish. Property and other holdings are lost along with any documentation. You are destitute.

**? Queen of Spades: Euryale.** You are cursed by the card. You suffer a permanent �2 penalty to all saving throws. Only a god or the Fates Card can end this curse.

**? Jack of Spades: Rogue.** A trusted ally, friend, or other NPC (chosen by the Narrator) becomes a bitter enemy, although their identity is not revealed.

They will act against you based upon their abilities and resources, and will try to utterly destroy you. Only a *wish* spell or divine intervention can end the NPC�s hostility.

**? Two of Spades: Balance.** Your history rewrites itself. You gain a

randomly determined background, replacing your background feature with the new background feature. You do not change the skill proficiencies or ability score increases from your previous background, or gain new skill proficiencies or ability score increases.

**Joker with Trademark: Fool.** You lose 10,000 xp and must immediately draw again. If the experience lost in this manner would cause you to lose a level, you are instead reduced to the beginning of your current level.

**Joker without Trademark: Jester.** Fortune smiles on the foolish. Either gain 10,000 XP or draw twice more from the deck beyond what you declared.

### Defender

*Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement; cost 60,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Heart of an ancient dragon

You gain +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword. In addition, while you are attuned to the sword, on each of your turns before you make your first attack with it you can transfer some or all of the +3 bonus to your Armor Class (instead of using it for attacks) until the start of your next turn or until you drop the sword (whichever comes first).

### Demon Armor

**Crafting Components:** Marilith sword or nalfeshnee tusks

### Describing Gremlins

*Wondrous item (gear gremlins), uncommon (cost 225 gp)*

**Crafting Components**: Scroll of

*enlarge/reduce*

This little porcelain chair has a Tiny ethereal purple goblinoid sitting on it, and in the creature�s hands sits another even smaller purple goblinoid, and in their hands sits an even smaller goblinoid, and so on.

This item includes 10 gremlins of decreasing scale from the largest at 4

inches tall, to the smallest that�s roughly the size of an amoeba.

If you place a single drop of a substance in front of the series of gremlins, the largest of them leans towards it and allows the smaller gremlins a minute to observe the drop�s contents at a cellular level. The smallest gremlin explains to the next size up, and so on, with the largest gremlin communicating back to you the description of the contents at a cellular level.

The gremlins are not particularly intelligent so most of their descriptions are similar to �*some sorta green globs*� or �*a buncha squidgy spiny things what tried to eat me*�.

Although this information is not scientifically or medically helpful, it can easily be used to identify if a substance is the same as another previously observed substance as the gremlins are consistent in their descriptions.

### Devil�s Eye Ring

*Ring, rare (cost 1,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Eye of a devil received through bargaining

This silver ring contains the sentient eye of a devil. While you are wearing the ring and it is uncovered, you have disadvantage on Persuasion checks but gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks.

As an action, you can remove the shackles, as can any creature you

designate when you use them. After every 2 weeks that passes, a shackled creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check to break free and destroy the shackles.

### Draconic Diorama

*Wondrous item, common (cost 45 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Skeleton of a dragon wyrmling

This Tiny diorama is contained within a cube-shaped box 5 inches on each side. The bottom is lead and the rest made of transparent crystal. Inside the box there are several trees made of paper and wire, a treasure chest made of clay, and a 1

1/2-inch dragon skeleton. The skeleton stands in a different position each time the box is examined but it does not move while being observed.

While you carry the diorama, you have advantage on saving throws against Frightful Presence.

A successful DC 13 Arcana or Nature check reveals the skeleton is an actual dragon skeleton that has been shrunk to fit inside the box.

**Curse.** While carrying the cursed diorama you are compelled to amass more wealth. As long as you are compelled, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to willingly part with the diorama, even temporarily.

Alternatively, you can shatter the bowl and choose one sleeping creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the sleeping creature awakens naturally, its dream and sleep cannot be interrupted or effected by any other magic.

### Dust of Disappearance

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Pixie dust

This shimmering dust is usually found in a small vial that contains enough for a single use. You can use an action to scatter the dust into the air, covering you and each creature and object within 10 feet and rendering them invisible for 2d4 minutes. This consumes the dust.

You and creatures within 30 feet of you that breathe make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become wracked with violent coughing and sneezing, becoming incapacitated and beginning to suffocate. While conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on a success. A *lesser restoration* spell also ends the effects.

### Dwarven Plate

*Armor (full plate), very rare (cost 20,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Iron of elemental earth that has not seen the light of the sun or moon

concentrating on a spell). An affected airborne creature falls, taking damage when it lands (maximum 8d6 bludgeoning damage).

* + **Reshape:** Cast *stone shape*.
  + **Withdraw:** Cast *meld into stone*.

***Curse.*** Releasing the charm�s power attracts the attention of a divi who seeks you out to demand your service.

*Weapon (shortsword), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Shards from a shattered *magic mirror*

| The efreeti serves you for up to 1 hour before being drawn back into the bottle. The bottle cannot be opened again for 24  11�90 hours. This effect occurs automatically the second and third time the bottle is opened.  The fourth time the bottle is opened, the efreeti vanishes and the bottle loses its enchantment. |
| The efreeti grants you 3 wishes (as the 91�100 *wish* spell) then vanishes after an hour or  after granting the final wish, and the bottle  becomes a mundane item. |

An elementally-imbued piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d4 elemental damage (see Table: Elemental Quiver). The enchantment begins to fade after the ammunition is removed from the quiver and vanishes entirely after 1 minute. Each piece of ammunition imbued with elemental power expends 1 charge from the quiver. The quiver has 20 charges and regains 1d4+2 charges each dawn.

### Elven Chain

*Armor (chain shirt), rare (cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Mithral worked on a fire born from the bark from an awakened tree

While wearing this armor your Armor Class increases by +1, and you are able to wear it without penalty even without proficiency. It only weighs 10 pounds, including the padding underneath, and can be stealthily worn under normal clothes.

### Emperor�s Blade

*Weapon, very rare (cost 9,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Chain devil�s chains

Spiked metal barbs line this *+1 longsword*, resembling the many rows of a shark�s teeth. You can use a bonus action to speak a command word that activates or deactivates the barbs. While activated, the barbs rapidly saw back and forth to tear into your foes, making your weapon attacks with the sword deal an extra 1d8 slashing damage.

When you score a critical hit while the barbs are active, the sawing barbs leave a terrible wound that deals 1d8 ongoing damage. At the start of each of its turns, a wounded creature makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus

+ your Strength modifier) to end the ongoing damage.

### Enchanted Music Sheet

*Wondrous item, common (cost 55 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Noted praises to a composer (the composer must be present for at least 1 hour of the item�s creation time)

This music sheet of fine parchment documents musical notation of a fey performance. Humming, whistling, or using an instrument to play the opening three notes causes the sheet music to issue the sounds of a hauntingly beautiful musical performance for 10 minutes. Up to 6 creatures of your choice that are within 30 feet of the sheet and able to hear the entire performance gain 2 temporary hit points. A creature can�t gain temporary hit points from the music sheet again until it completes a long rest, and after using this feature you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

During a short rest, you can spend an hour to amend the music sheet with pen and ink to alter its melody and mood. Regardless of the changes you make to the sheet, the notation remains legible and the music is always lovely.

If you accompany the music, using an instrument or singing with a DC 12 Performance check, you can empower its magic. Up to 6 creatures of your choice that are within 30 feet of you and able to hear the entire performance regain 3 hit points and gain 6 temporary hit points. At the end of the performance, the music sheet transforms into a flutter of petals and butterflies, and its magic is lost.

**Curse.** The music sheet is cursed and a creature with temporary hit points gained by its music has disadvantage on saving throws to resist being charmed and frightened by celestials, fiends, and fey.

Empowering the magic with your own performance draws the attention of a fey who seeks you out to perform at an event of their choosing.

### Essay on Efficient Armor Management

*Wondrous item, common (cost 80 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Notes on the use of armor from a dozen retired adventurers

This treatise details techniques for how to quickly handle armor. Spending 1 hour over 3 days memorizing the essay�s techniques teaches you how to use an action to doff light and medium armors. The parchment then becomes a mundane item for a year and a day before it regains its magic.

### Ever-Shifting Map

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 100 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Nugget of precious metal or stone mined during a prospector�s final expedition

Created by a dwarven prospector who made it his life�s goal to map out as many of the deepest dungeons and tunnels as he possibly could, this tattered piece of parchment has a display of words and diagrams on it that is in constant flux. When you attune to the map, the words change to the language of your choosing. Whenever

you examine the map, you can immediately find north no matter where you are, so long as you are on a plane of existence that has traditional cardinal directions.

When you speak a command word etched on the back corner of the map while you are underground, you recall the memory of the dwarven prospector embarking on what he feared to be his last expedition, delving so deep that he thought he might never return. When this happens, the map shows you the direction to the largest cache of treasure (measured in number of coins and jewels) within 1 mile. The map shows you passageways relevant to your destination and gives you advantage on ability checks to find secret doors, but does not note the location of monsters or traps. The information on the map disappears after your next long rest, at which point all writing vanishes from the parchment and it becomes a mundane item.

### Eversmoking Bottle

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Magma mephit cinders

This glass bottle is filled with whirling smoke. You can use an action to remove the stopper, causing a thick cloud to pour out and fill a 60-foot radius centered on the bottle, making the area heavily obscured. The cloud grows by 10 feet for each minute that the bottle remains open, to a maximum radius of 120 feet.

The cloud remains until the bottle is closed. Closing the bottle requires the item�s command word and an action, after which the smoke disperses after 10 minutes.

Moderate winds disperse the smoke after 1 minute. Strong winds disperse the smoke after 1 round.

### Eyes of Charming

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 250 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Nymph tears These framed lenses are worn over the eyes and contain 3 charges. You can use an

action to expend 1 charge and cast the *charm person* spell (save DC 13). Both you and the target must be able to see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges at dawn.

### Eyes of Minute Seeing

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 200 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Fine lenses These wire-framed lenses are worn over the eyes and enhance your vision within 1 foot. You gain advantage on any sight-based Investigation checks made to study an object or area within that range

### Eyes of the Eagle

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 250 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Fine lenses These wire-framed lenses fit over the eyes and grant you advantage on sight-based Perception checks. When visibility is clear you can make out fine details at extreme ranges, easily discerning creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

### Excalibur

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement; cost 150,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Metal blessed by spirits of nature representing each element

This legendary weapon is said to grant powerful magic to its wielder and that only the rightful ruler of the land is suitable to carry it into battle. While you are attuned to it, Excalibur grants you the following benefits:

* If you are the rightful wielder of *Excalibur*, it instantly attunes to you and does not take up an attunement slot.
* You gain a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
  + When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.
  + When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target�s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the Narrator. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.
  + You can speak the sword�s command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or

sheathing the sword puts out the light.

* + When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can�t use this property again until you finish a long rest.
  + You have advantage on Insight and Persuasion checks made against anyone but creatures you consider to be your close allies and companions.

### Excalibur�s Scabbard

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 55,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Leather blessed by spirits of nature representing each element

While wearing this longsword scabbard, you have resistance to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

### Explorer�s Chalk

*Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** 2 fossilized bones excavated from digs at least 1,000 miles apart

This unassuming piece of white chalk appears well-used but does not wear down no matter how many times it marks a surface. The *explorer�s chalk* has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges each dawn. When you touch it to a surface, you can expend 1 of its charges to create a mark that cannot be wiped away or obscured for 24 hours. While holding the chalk, you can use an action to become aware of the direction of the closest mark made with it as long as that mark is within 1 mile.

If you expend the *explorer�s chalk�s* last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the chalk crumbles to dust. On a 20, the chalk regains its expended charges and its number of charges increases by 1.

### Faerie Love Letter

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; a secret worth at least 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Secrets kept by two different fey creatures

This miniature private correspondence, which smells of floral perfume, is proof of a particularly scandalous dalliance between two noble fey which you can exploit for a favor. While attuned to the letter you can whisper the command word to cast either *druidcraft* or *mending*. You can�t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Alternatively, you can use an action to summon a Tiny faerie (AC 15, HP 1, Speed fly 30 ft., spell save DC 12). The faerie is charmed by you and acts immediately, casting one of the following spells as directed: *faerie fire*, *healing word*, or *hideous laughter*, after which it acts to preserve its own life and will only take the Dodge or Hide actions. If the faerie dies in your service the letter loses its power, but you retain the proof of misconduct.

Otherwise the faerie disappears after 1 minute, taking its love letter with it.

### Family Scrapbook

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** 3 items of sentimental value received from different generations of the same family

This scrapbook contains the legacy of campaigns undertaken by adventurers in days past. When in need of advice, you can open the leather-bound tome and spend 1 minute looking for a similar situation. Roll a d10 and on a 7 or higher, you learn one fact relevant to the situation. On a failure, you instead learn one fact or piece of advice that is irrelevant to the situation (such as �*a group of tigers is called an ambush*,� or �*you should eat more leafy greens*�). Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to rapidly find one tale of questing relevant to your situation and rip it out of the book. Choose one 1st-level spell that has a casting time of 1 action from any class spell list. Before the end of your next turn, you can cast this spell without the need for material components. After a page is torn from the tome in this way, it becomes a mundane scrapbook.

### Fathomer�s Ring

*Ring (patron token), common (cost 85 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Fish hook plucked from the mouth of a shark or huge aquatic creature

This ring reeks of muck dredged from the ocean floor. While you wear it, you automatically know the depth of any body of water you can see.

As an action, you can cause one submerged, unattended object up to Huge size to rise to the surface of the water at a rate of 500 feet per round. You don�t need to be able to see the object you affect, but you must be familiar with it or at least possess a general description of it. Once the object reaches the water�s surface, it floats there for 1 hour or until you use another action to return it to its resting place. Once you�ve

used the ring in this way, it loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.

### Feather Token

*Wondrous item, rare (cost varies)*

**Crafting Components:** Magically-infused silver

This small silver charm resembles a feather. Many types of feather tokens exist with different effects. The Narrator chooses or randomly determines the type of feather token found by rolling d100.

**TABLE: FEATHER TOKEN**

massive flapping fan or palm frond, creating enough wind to power the vessel or increase its speed by 5 miles per hour for up to 8 hours. When the effect ends, the token disappears. You may spend an action to dismiss the fan.

| --- | --- |
| **D100** | **COST TOKEN** |
| 1�20 | 550 gp ***Anchor.*** As an action, you can touch the token to a boat, ship, or other water vehicle. The vessel is immovable for the next 24 hours. You can repeat the action to end the effect early. When the effect ends, the token becomes a mundane item. |
| 21�35 | 850 gp ***Boat.*** As an action, you can toss the token onto a body of water 60 feet in diameter or larger. The token transforms into a 50-foot long, 20-foot wide boat.  The boat needs no propulsion and moves at a speed of 6 miles per hour, requiring no skill to operate. You can use an action to direct the boat to turn up to 90 degrees. Up to 32 medium creatures and their equipment can travel comfortably on the boat (Large creatures count as 4 creatures and Huge creatures count as 8 creatures).  The boat remains for up to 24 hours before disappearing. You may spend an action to dismiss the boat. |
| 36�50 | 1,000 ***Bird.*** You can use an action to toss the gp token nearby where it transforms into a roc. The bird obeys simple commands,  though it will not attack, and can fly 16 miles an hour for up to 6 hours while carrying up to 500 pounds, or at half that speed while carrying up to 1,000 pounds. The roc disappears after flying its maximum distance or when reduced to 0 hit points. You may spend an action to dismiss the roc. |
| 51�65 550 gp ***Fan.*** While on a wind-powered vessel,  you can use an action to toss the token into the air where it transforms into a | |

action to toss the token onto an unoccupied patch of ground where it erupts into a nonmagical living oak tree. The tree is 80 feet tall and has a 5-foot diameter trunk with a branch spread of up to 20 feet.

91�100 700 gp ***Whip.*** You can use an action to toss the

token to a point that you can see within 10 feet. The token transforms into a floating whip that you can command by using a bonus action, making it move up to 20 feet and attack a creature up to 10 feet away from it. The whip has an attack bonus of +10 and deals 1d6 + 6 force damage. The whip vanishes after 1 hour, when you die, or when you use an action to dismiss it.

### Figurine of Shared Affliction

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Needle used to suture at least a dozen major injuries

This small wooden figurine was crafted by a healer whose magic allowed him to absorb other people�s afflictions into his own body. The item changes shape, taking on your rough appearance when you attune to it.

While carrying the figurine on your person, you have advantage on the first Medicine check you make to treat a disease or poison. Only one creature per day can use the figurine in this manner. When you successfully treat an affliction, the figurine takes on a sickly visage as it absorbs the disease or poison. The *figurine of shared affliction* grants no benefits until it returns to its normal appearance at the end of your next long rest.

When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to relive the last memory of the healer who created the totem, in which they gave their life to absorb a deadly illness that infected their kin. When this happens, for the next minute you have advantage on death saves. The figurine shows the effects of the attacks you�ve suffered in gruesome detail before reverting to a featureless wooden carving and forever losing its magic.

### Figurine of Wondrous Power

*Wondrous Item, rarity by figurine (cost varies)*

**Crafting Components:** Varies

These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill�some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.

If you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw a figurine at an unoccupied space within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material.

The resulting creature is friendly to you and your companions, with a notable

exception listed below. It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.

Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a duration specific to each creature, as detailed in its entry.

There is always a 5% chance per use that the steed ignores your orders, including commands that it return to figurine form. If you mount the steed during this time, it instantly teleports the two of you to a random location in Hell, whereupon it immediately reverts to figurine form.  After this figurine has been used, it can�t be used again until 5 days have passed. | | | |
| ***Onyx Dog*** | Rare | 5,000  gp | Collar worn by a dog for a year and a day |

### Finder Gremlin

*Wondrous item (gear gremlin), common (cost 20 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Compass broken in anger

This tiny ethereal silver goblinoid sits in a clamshell container along with a miniature cup of water and a single thin needle. When prompted with a bonus action, the gremlin uses the cup and needle to try and find magnetic north, although it is not particularly good at this. Whenever the gremlin tries to find true north, roll a d10, and on a result of a 1 it gets confused, pointing in the exact opposite direction instead.

### Fire Charm

*Wondrous item (charm), uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Coin found in ruins beneath a lava flow

While wearing this charm you can use an action to light or extinguish a candle-sized flame within 5 feet, or you can break the charm to release its power, destroying it to activate one of the following effects.

* Cleanse: Cast *lesser restoration*.
* Resist: Cast *protection from energy* (fire only).
* Scorch: Cast *scorching ray* at 3rd-level (+7 spell attack bonus).

***Curse.*** Releasing the charm�s power attracts the attention of an efreeti who seeks you out to demand a gift.

### Fizzy Lifter

*Potion, common (cost 85 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Brown sugar boiled by a dragon�s breath

This glass bottle contains a brown bubbly liquid and bears a winking wizard on the label. When you are unconscious and have at least 1 hit point, if another creature forces

you to sniff this powerful concoction you immediately wake up.

Alternatively, when you consume this potion you are targeted by the *levitate* spell (save DC 14) but are also comically bloated with bubbles, taking a ?2 penalty to Constitution saving throws for the duration.

### Fizzy Rocks

*Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Secret whispered into raw cane sugar

This paper packet bearing a winking wizard�s face contains a dozen brightly colored sugary pebbles that fizz when eaten. When you consume a piece of this candy, you can use a bonus action to throw your voice to any point you can see within 60 feet, and your voice emanates directly from that point until the start of your next turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.

Alternatively, you can consume all 12 *fizzy rocks* to cast *thunderwave* as a 2nd-level spell (dealing 2d8 thunder damage; save DC 14). You are made an additional target of the spell when casting it in this way.

**Fizzy Lifter and Fizzy Rocks**

The combination of these two confections are rumored to result in an effect that is ambiguous but indescribably bad. If an adventurer ignores the warning and consumes both items at once this optional effect may be used:

When a creature consumes both *fizzy lifter* and *fizzy rocks* within a minute of each other, the arcane chemical reaction causes the effects of both items to end and a torrent of harmless foam to rocket out of the creature�s mouth, propelling it in the opposite direction. Determine a direction randomly by rolling a d8. The creature is pushed 100 feet in that direction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. If it impacts a creature or object along this path it stops, is knocked prone, and takes 23 (5d8) bludgeoning damage, dealing the same amount of damage to whatever it impacts.

### Flame Tongue

*Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** A written contract with a devil or other extraplanar and fiery entity

While you are attuned to this magic sword, you can use a bonus action and speak its command word to set the sword alight, shedding bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While lit, attacks using the sword deal an extra 2d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to put them out or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

### Flask of Inebriation

*Wondrous item, common (cost 90 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Last copper piece to a drunkard�s name

This plain and rough old steel flask hides one�s vices most inconspicuously. Any liquid poured into the flask instantly becomes intoxicating and remains so even if poured out of the flask. The flask has no effect on any form of magical liquids poured into it.

The flask has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge, spraying a 10-foot cone that empties the flask of its contents.

Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned by the potent alcohol. At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned by the flask can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the flask loses its potency and becomes a mundane item.

### Flicker Dagger

*Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement;*

*cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Sharpened bones of a doppelganger

While you are attuned to and wielding this dagger, you can use a bonus action to

summon a flickering illusion for 1 minute. Your flickering illusion shares your space, moves with you, and is treated as another enemy of the target for the purposes of the Sneak Attack feature, but it cannot be targeted with attacks and provides no penalties to creatures attacking you. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Focusing Eye

*Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Cockatrice eye jelly

This thumb-sized opal is carved to resemble an open eye. As an action, you can affix it to your forehead where it remains in place until you use another action to remove it. While you wear the eye, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks you make while speaking telepathically with another creature.

The eye has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk. You can use an action to expend 2 charges and cast *detect thoughts* on any creature with whom you have communicated telepathically during the last 24 hours, regardless of your distance from the creature. Alternatively, you can expend 3 charges to cast *clairvoyance* centered on the creature�s current location.

When you expend the eye�s last charge, it permanently affixes to your forehead but otherwise becomes a normal opal.

### Folding Boat

*Wondrous item, rare (cost 4,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Wooden box that has soaked in blessed seawater for 7 days and nights

This dark wood box with nautical-themed carvings measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and always floats in water. Three command words control its functions as follows:

The first command word turns the box into a four-person sailboat equipped with sail, oars, and anchor. It is 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a 24-foot longship that is 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep. This ship has a deck, rowing seats, 5 sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. It can hold 15 Medium creatures comfortably.

A third command word causes the folding boat to revert to its original shape, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can�t fit inside the box remain outside and any objects that can fit inside do.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.

### Friendly Joybuzzer

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Joyful tears cried from a successful practical joke

This tin ring houses a small circular device with a red button. You have advantage on Sleight of Hand checks made to hide the *friendly joybuzzer*. Once you are attuned to this magic item, whenever a creature presses the button (even inadvertently through a handshake) for the next minute it becomes happier and friendlier towards you. For the duration, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks against the creature. If the creature sees the joybuzzer

being used or recognizes it as a magical item, it immediately realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and may become hostile toward you.

Alternatively, once you are attuned to this magic item, while you are shaking hands with a creature you can choose to destroy the *friendly joybuzzer*. Make a melee spell attack with advantage, using your highest mental ability score as your spellcasting ability score. On a successful hit, you target the creature as if you had cast *shocking grasp*, treating each damage die as if you had rolled the maximum amount.

### Frost Brand

*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement; cost 8,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Ice chipped from the highest point of a frost giant�s castle

If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents are ejected safely, and the haversack must be reversed before its magic properties function.

Food or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities�after being in the bag, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored to life by *revivify*, *raise dead*, or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

* If at least one ruby remains, you have resistance to fire damage.
* If at least one fire opal remains, you can use an action to speak a command word and cause a weapon you are holding to erupt in flames, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. The flames cast bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word or you release the weapon.
* Whenever you fail a saving throw against a spell and take fire damage as a result, roll a d20. On a 1, light blazes from the remaining gems.

A wish made from the innocent heart of a scullery maid created these magical shoes, upon which she danced her way into a better life. You can only attune to these shoes if you are the first creature to do so. When you attune to the shoes, they resize to perfectly fit your feet and your feet alone. During the day they take the form of simple wooden clogs, and by night the shoes transform into beautiful glass slippers that somehow hold your weight without breaking.

**Crafting Components:** Metal that has been struck by a storm giant�s lightning

You can use an action to speak the horn�s command word and blow it, emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away.

After studying this book for 1 hour each day over the course of a year and a day, you gain permanent influence over one randomly determined humanoid on your plane, even if it is immune to being charmed. This otherwise functions as the *suggestion* spell (no saving throw). The target uses the statistics of a **cambion**, but maintains its prior physical appearance. A *wish* spell, or the destruction of the book via *disintegrate* or similar magic, frees the creature from this effect.

### Humour Realignment Transfiguration

*Varies, common (cost 30 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Malachite

People seeking a permanent change to their body tend to avoid shapechanging magic�it�s costly and scarce, and the thought of a wayward dispel reverting you to your old form and triggering a wave of dysphoria is horrifying. Instead most seek out magics that gradually encourage the systems of their body to adopt a new form. These magics take many shapes: potions from an alchemist, a blessed amulet, a pouch of ritual ingredients from a wizard.

Using the magic requires a 5 minute ritual at the end of each long rest. At the end of the first month, your outward appearance begins to take on the shape and characteristics of a form more comfortable to you. By the end of six months of use, your body fully shifts to your desired comfortable form. To maintain the new form you must continue to perform the ritual�ceasing it reverts these changes at the same pace. Any new form must be of the same heritage as your previous form.

### Hungry Quasit

*Wondrous item (patron token), common (cost 75 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Quasit horns This Tiny bloodstone is carved in the shape of a grinning, pot-bellied quasit. Whenever you would gain temporary hit points, you can choose to store them inside the quasit instead. Unlike normal temporary hit points, the hit points you store inside the quasit stack, although the maximum number of temporary hit points the quasit can hold at

one time is equal to your Charisma modifier

+ your warlock level (minimum 1).

You can use an action to activate the quasit and gain all the temporary hit points currently stored inside it, which last for up to 1 hour. Whenever you activate the quasit, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, you don�t gain any temporary hit points, and instead the quasit animates and flies off never to be seen again.

### Ice Riders

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 260 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Yeti feet

The magic focused in the soles of these boots enable you to traverse ice and snow as if it were solid, non-slippery ground. You ignore difficult terrain created by cold conditions.

When traveling over snow, you leave only 1/2-inch deep footprints, enabling you to walk over deep drifts without the dangers of

falling in. Similarly, you can step onto a floating chunk of ice without fear of tipping it over, although jumping onto the ice will �push� it in the direction of the jump.

### Immovable Rod

*Rod, uncommon (cost 400 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Drop of *sovereign glue*, 2 lodestones

You can use an action to press this metal rod�s single button, magically fixing it in place where it defies gravity. To move the rod, you or another creature must use an action to press the button again.

The rod can support up to 8,000 pounds of weight (if this is exceeded, the rod deactivates and falls). A creature that attempts to move the rod needs to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the rod up to 10 feet on a success.

### Impossible Cube

*Wondrous item, rare (cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Metal made from ore that has visited at least 7 planes

At a glance this hand-sized item appears to be a metal framework in the simple shape of a cube, but when looked at more closely it becomes clear that the geometry of the framework is impossible with absurd angles, preposterous twists, and endpoints. Any attempt to follow the various lines and compositions to their conclusion is frustrating at best and truly maddening at worst.

When a creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher sees the cube for the first time it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become compelled to study the cube further. When a creature first studies the cube, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffers from the Terrorized short-term mental stress effect and a compulsion to study the cube even further. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more instead suffers from the Distorted Perceptions long-term mental stress effect. Any further inspection of the cube has no additional effect.

### Infernal Carapace

* Your Strength score increases to 20. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.
* You have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.
* Once between rests, as a bonus action you can choose a creature that can see you, forcing it to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1 minute.
* Your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
* Celestials, elementals, fey, and creatures with the Good alignment trait have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you.

### Inkpot of the Thrifty Apprentice

*Wondrous item, common (cost 75 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** First and last pay stubs received by an apprentice clerk

This appears like a mundane pot of ink. When you speak the command word and use a bonus action to expend 1 charge, it

fills with enough ink of the color of your choice to fill 50 pages of parchment. This ink is extremely hard to remove from any surface, including cloth or flesh, and often takes many days and washings to clean away. The ink cannot be used to inscribe spells. When removed from the pot with anything but a quill the ink instantly dries.

When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges as an action, a 15-foot cone of ink erupts from the inkpot, coating anything and everything that it hits. Creatures in the area make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature is blinded until it spends an action cleaning the ink away from its eyes.

The inkpot has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 5 or less, the inkpot loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.

### Inspiring Pahu

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 140 gp)* Crafting Components: Weapon entombed for at least 100 years with a humanoid

warrior

This large bass drum is covered in cured sharkskin. When struck the drum creates a deep resonant sound that sets the tempo for a song, an excellent tool for motivating warriors before battle.

This drum has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can use a bonus action to play it and expend 1 charge, focusing its energies on a living creature that has 0 hit points and that you can see within 20 feet. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has advantage on death saving throws.

Alternatively, you can use an action to play it and expend 2 charges. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw.

On a success, a creature gains inspiration. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20.

On a result of 5 or less, the sharkskin membrane covering the drum breaks and it becomes a mundane item.

### Instant Fortress

*Wondrous item, very rare (15,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** 1,000 pounds of stone from a fortress that has withstood siege, bulette hides

As an action, you can place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high. Each creature or unattended object in the area where the fortress appears takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage. Creatures can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a success.

Once activated, the fortress remains until you use another action to speak the command word that dismisses it. The fortress can only be dismissed when it is empty.

When activated, the cube transforms into a square tower, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement along the top, with a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action (it is immune to spells like *knock* and related magic, such as a *chime of opening*.) The tower�s interior has two floors, with a ladder connecting them and continuing on to a trapdoor to the roof.

The tower is made of adamantine, and it can�t be tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20, 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons that aren�t siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a *wish* spell can repair the fortress: each casting causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points. This use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th-level or lower.

### Instrument of Irresistible Symphonies

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Gilded songbird feathers

Once per week, you can use an action to speak a command word that causes this instrument to play its own beautiful music for 1 minute. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of the instrument that is able to hear the music. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw at the start of each of its turns or it is forced to dance in place for as long as the music plays. While the creature dances, it is considered grappled.

### Ioun Stones

*Wondrous items, rarity varies (requires attunement; cost varies)*

**Crafting Components:** Varies�see individual stones

There are many types of *ioun stones*, each imbued with powerful beneficial magic.

Once you have attuned to one, you can use an action to set it in a gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature may use an action to try and take an orbiting stone, but must make a melee attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. An *ioun stone*�s AC is 24, it has 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive state. Each stone has an effect while it is orbiting your head.

If there aren�t enough available levels to hold a spell, it cannot be stored.  While the stone is orbiting you, you can cast any spell stored in it using the appropriate action.

### Iron Bands of Binding

*Wondrous item, rare (cost 1,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Glabrezu pincer, link from a chain devil�s chain

This smooth iron sphere conceals a formidable set of restraints that unfolds into metal bands when thrown. Once between long rests you can use an action to throw it at a creature within 60 feet, treating it as if it were a ranged weapon attack with which you are proficient. On a hit, if the creature is Huge-sized or smaller it becomes restrained until you use a bonus action to speak a different command word and release it.

A creature can try to break the bands by using an action to make a DC 20 Strength Check. On a success, the bands are broken and the restrained creature is freed. On a failure, the creature cannot try again until 24 hours have passed.

### Iron Flask

*Wondrous item, legendary (cost 50,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Cold iron refined on the night of a new moon

This dark iron bottle feels heavy in your hand. Engraved with powerful runes of binding, it is capable of trapping otherworldly creatures. You can use an action to speak the command word and remove the silver stopper from the flask, targeting a creature within 60 feet that is not native to the plane of existence the flask is currently on.

If the *iron flask* is empty and you can see the creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become trapped in the flask. A creature that has previously been trapped in this flask has advantage on this save. The trapped creature is held in stasis�it doesn�t breathe, eat, drink, or age.

As an action, you can release the creature trapped within. A released creature remains friendly to you and your allies for 1 hour, during which it obeys your verbal

commands, and afterward it acts normally. Without any commands or when given a command likely to result in its death, the creature defends itself but otherwise takes no actions.

Casting *identify* on this flask also reveals if a creature is trapped within, but will not reveal the type. The only way to determine an *iron flask*�s contents is to open the flask and release its inhabitant.

Newly acquired *iron flasks* may already have a trapped creature, either chosen by the Narrator or determined randomly.

**Crafting Components:** Knights from a chess set used by best friends to play at least a dozen games of chess

These two ivory figurines look as though they belong with a chess set. If you and one other person hold one of the knights, you can use an action to whisper in the ear of the game piece to communicate with the creature holding the other (as the *message* cantrip).

If you and the person carrying the other figurine hold your game pieces to your hearts while within 120 feet of each other, you share a remembrance of two outmatched knights rushing into battle.

Within the next minute, each of you can use an action once to teleport to any point between your current positions. You each can teleport once, after which the figurines lose their power.

### Jade Tiger

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Blood of a weretiger

This jade figurine carries the memories of a weretiger that spent years tracking and hunting its prey under the light of the jungle moon. When you attune to the item and keep it on your person, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made to find and follow tracks for up to 1 hour per day.

When you speak the *jade tiger*�s command word, you vividly recall one of the weretiger�s most challenging hunts. For the next minute, you can use a bonus action to make a Stealth check to hide immediately before or after you take the Attack action.

The *jade tiger*�s magic forever fades away after being used in this way.

### Jarred Brain

*Wondrous item, common (cost 75 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Brain of a humanoid academic

A humanoid brain floats in formaldehyde within this glass and iron jar, the electrodes protruding from its lid sparking on occasion as the mass of tissue within twitches. You can use an action to gain a flash of insight by shocking your own mind with the jar�s electrodes, taking 1d6 lightning damage.

You gain 5 expertise dice to use on Intelligence checks made in the next minute, either individually or up to as many as 3 at a time. Once the jar is used in this way the sparks recede and it cannot be used in this way again for the next 24 hours.

Alternatively, the brain can be wired up directly to the mind of another creature. This process takes 1 minute and allows a creature to consult the jarred brain about a specific course of action (as the spell *augury*), after which it malfunctions and shatters.

### Javelin of Lightning

*Weapon (javelin), uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Amber found on a stormy day at the beach

Once per dawn, when you throw this magic weapon and speak its command word it transforms into a 5-foot wide line of electricity that is 120 feet long.

### Legerdemain Gloves

*Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp)*

While wearing both of these gloves, once per minute you can teleport an item, up to the size of a dagger, from one hand to the other.

The gloves can teleport an item a longer distance, but their magic is forever exhausted in the process. When you wear one glove and another creature within 120 feet wears the other, you can teleport an item up to the size of a dagger into the hand of the creature wearing the other glove. If you do, the gloves dry and crack, losing their magic and becoming mundane items.

### Library Scarf

*Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Scarf knitted and gifted by a loved one

A library scarf appears as a simple woolen scarf of whatever color or pattern its creator chooses. When you use a bonus action to speak its command word and expend 1 charge, the scarf magically warms you for 2 hours, providing comfort and protection from cold temperatures down to freezing (under more frigid conditions, each charge insulates you for 1 hour.)

In dire circumstances, the scarf can offer more significant protection. When you take cold damage, you can use your reaction

and expend 3 charges to gain cold resistance until the end of the round.

The scarf has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the scarf loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Gilded raven quill meticulously used to record at least 20 hours of academic recitation

When you spend a bonus action to speak the command word and expend 1 charge, this quill leaps to life and copies everything said by a target that you can hear within 60 feet. The quill ceases to copy after 1 hour, when the target moves more than 60 feet away from it, stops speaking for more than 10 minutes, or when it runs out of writing surface.

When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, as an action you hurl it at a target you can see within 10 feet. For 1 minute, the quill attacks once per round at the end of your turn. It has a +2 bonus to attack and deals 1d4 piercing damage on a successful hit. When you roll a natural 1 to attack with the quill, it loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.

Alternatively, you can exhaust the lockpicks� magic completely to borrow a skill or memory from a previous user. You can choose to either watch 10 minutes of a previous user�s memory (taken from the span of time they had the lockpicks in their possession) or for 10 minutes you can gain one skill, tool, or language proficiency of the previous user. At the end of the duration, the lockpicks rust away to nothing.

attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You must use the new roll.

This hairy humanoid foot has been chemically preserved and attached to a simple chain necklace as a pendant.

Whenever you roll a natural 1 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw while wearing this necklace, you may choose to reroll and must use the new result. Once you make a reroll in this way, you cannot do so again for 24 hours. In addition, halflings get an unnerving sense of this macabre trophy even when it is hidden. While wearing this necklace you have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks to influence halflings.

Alternatively, these mortal remains can be buried or burned properly through halfling funerary rites taking 1 hour. Up to 8 creatures in attendance gain inspiration.

### Luminescent Gum

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 200 gp per gum)*

**Crafting Components:** Sponges harvested from the abyssal plains at the bottom of the ocean

This salty chewing gum is made from the sap of a deep sea plant and is normally stored inside of a clamshell. In order to activate it, you must chew the gum as an action. The center of your forehead forms a slight bump and begins to glow. Any darkness within a range of 120 feet becomes dim light, and any dim light within the same range becomes bright light. The effect lasts for 1 hour, after which the gum loses its magical properties. The gum itself

is a bit of an acquired taste and when you chew it for the first time you must make a DC 10 Constitution check or gain the stunned condition for a round as you vomit. Vomited gum can be retrieved and used again, but its remaining duration is halved every time it is reused.

Luminescent gum is generally found in bunches of 6 or 12 clamshells.

**Crafting Components:** Shard of a broken mirror that once reflected a banshee�s horrifying visage

This weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges at dawn. While you hold the weapon, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to emanate terror in a

30-foot radius. Each creature you choose within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While frightened, the target can�t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. On each of its turns, the target must move away from you as fast as possible (it can only use the Dash action, try to escape anything preventing it from moving, or use the Dodge action if it can�t move or attempt escape). The target can�t take reactions. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

When you do, you initiate a face-to-face conversation that can last up to 10 minutes. Both you and the other mirror�s owner can clearly see each other�s faces, but neither one of you gets any sense of the other�s surroundings.

Using the manual is difficult, and any creature that doesn�t have at least two 5th-level spell slots takes 6d6 psychic damage when it attempts to read the manual.

To create a guardian, you must spend the requisite number of days working without interruption on the guardian (as shown on the Manual of Guardians table). During this time, you must have the manual at hand, and you can�t rest more than 8 hours per day. In addition, you must pay the requisite cost in materials.

When you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. After sprinkling the book�s ashes on it, the guardian animates under your control and obeys your verbal commands.

Once complete, the painting becomes a real, three-dimensional object.

* Small, simple objects take a single round to paint. Larger objects, like doors or rooms, take more time. It takes 1 minute of concentration to cover 10 square feet of a surface, and 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet of a surface.
* Objects created by the pigment are real and nonmagical�a door painted on a wall can be

opened into whatever lies beyond. A pit becomes a real pit (be sure to include the depth in your total area). A tree blooms and grows.

* Objects created by the pigments are worth a maximum of 25 gp. Gemstones or fine clothing might look authentic, but close inspection reveals they are facsimiles made from cheaper materials.
* When found the box contains 1d4 pots of pigment.
* A pot of pigment can cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, creating a total area of 10,000 cubic feet of objects.

Alternatively, you can use an action to blow extremely hard through the whistle to cast *sending* without any other spell components. When you cast *sending* in this way, your message can contain only 10 words, and there�s a 10 percent chance the message doesn�t arrive (even if you�re on the same plane of existence as the recipient).

* If a creature would become trapped but the mirror�s cells are already full, a randomly determined trapped creature is freed to make room for the new prisoner.

different command word. The creature appears in an unoccupied space near the mirror and facing away from it.

On a 6 or higher, the medallion can�t be used this way again until the next dawn. On a 5 or less, the medallion becomes a mundane piece of jewelry.

### Pipes of the Sewers

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 350 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Hollowed out bones of a giant rat

These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges at dawn. If you are proficient with wind instruments, you can use an action to play the pipes and expend 1 to 3 charges, summoning a **swarm of rats** for each charge you spend. The swarms aren�t under anyone�s control and appear by the shortest available route. If at the Narrator�s discretion there aren�t enough rats within a half mile for this property to take effect, the expended charges are wasted and no swarm is summoned.

While you are using an action to play the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the Wisdom check of a swarm of rats within 30 feet. If you lose the contest, the swarm acts normally and is immune to the pipes for 24 hours. If you win, the swarm becomes friendly to you and your allies and follows your commands until you stop playing the pipes. If not given a command, a friendly swarm defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. A friendly swarm that starts its turn unable to hear music from the pipes breaks your control, behaving as normal and becoming immune to the effects of the pipes for 24 hours.

**Crafting Components:** Roots gathered from the Dreaming

When found, only 2d6 pages remain inside this tome. Over the course of 1 minute, you can tear out a page from the book and dissolve it in a nonmagical liquid, transforming the liquid into a dose of oil of taggit.

### Portable Hole

*Wondrous item, rare (cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Preserved corpses of 7 shadows

While not in use, this item appears as a piece of cloth the color of darkness. When unfolded, it opens up into a circular sheet that is 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold the *portable hole* on a stable, solid surface. When unfolded, the item opens into a cylindrical extradimensional space that is 10 feet deep. Closing the hole requires an action and involves you taking hold of the cloth�s edges and folding it up. No matter its contents, the hole weighs next to nothing.

The hole can�t be used to create passages through solid surfaces. Food or water placed in a closed *portable hole* immediately and permanently loses all nourishing qualities� water no longer slakes thirst and food doesn�t sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the *portable hole* can�t be restored to life by *revivify, raise dead,* or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside a closed *portable hole* can

survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures inside the hole (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.

While the hole is open, creatures inside can exit the hole by simply climbing out. A creature still within the hole can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to escape as it�s being closed. On a success, the creature appears within 5 feet of the item or creature carrying it.

Placing a *portable hole* inside another extradimensional storage device, such as a *bag of holding* or *handy haversack*, results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.

### Rod of Absorption

*Rod, very rare (requires attunement; cost 30,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Wand wielded by an abjuration archmage

While holding this rod, you can use your

reaction to absorb a spell as it�s being cast, provided it targets only you and not an area of effect. An absorbed spell has no effect, and its energy is stored within the rod. The spell�s energy equals the spell levels used to cast it. The rod can store up to 50 spell levels� worth of energy, after which it permanently loses the ability to absorb energy. If the rod doesn�t have the space to store a spell and you try to absorb it, the rod has no effect. A rod that can no longer store energy and no longer has any energy remaining within it loses its magical properties.

After attuning to the rod, you know how much energy it currently contains and how

much it has ever absorbed. A spellcaster can expend the energy in the rod and convert it to spell slots�for example, you can expend 3 spell levels of energy from the rod to cast a 3rd-level spell, even if you no longer have the spell slot to cast it. The spell must be a spell you know or have prepared, at a level you can cast, and no higher than 5th-level.

When found, the rod contains 1d10 spell levels.

### Rod of Alertness

*Rod, very rare (requires attunement; cost 15,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Sphinx�s eye, wild coffee beans picked under a full moon

While holding this rod, you have advantage on Perception checks and initiative rolls, and as an action you can cast the following spells: *detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, see invisibility*.

***Protective Aura.*** As an action, you can plant the rod in the ground and speak its command word, causing the rod to emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in the bright light, you and creatures friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature also in the bright light.

The rod stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or sooner if a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. Once you�ve used this property, it can�t be used again until the next dawn.

### Rod of Lordly Might

*Rod, legendary (requires attunement; cost 80,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Fragment of a fire giant�s anvil, mimic�s gemstone heart, freely given blood from a vampire

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this rod, which appears as a magical mace in its default form. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack using the rod, you can activate one of the following three properties:

* **Drain Life:** The target makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.
* **Paralyze:** The target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success.
* **Terrify:** The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success.

Once you�ve used one of these properties, that property can�t be used again until the next dawn.

***Six Buttons.*** The rod has buttons along its haft that alter the rod�s form when pressed. You can press one of the buttons as a bonus action, and the effect lasts until you push a different button for a new effect or press the same button again to revert the rod to its default form.

* + **Button 1:** The rod loses its bonus to attack and damage rolls, instead producing a fiery blade from its haft, which you can wield as a *flame tongue* sword of your choice.
  + **Button 2:** The rod transforms into a magic battleaxe.
  + **Button 3:** The rod transforms into a magic spear.
  + **Button 4:** The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long. A spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole into any surface as hard as granite. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Either excess weight or a lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its default form.
  + **Button 5:** The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram that grants a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.
  + **Button 6:** The rod assumes or remains in its default form and indicates magnetic north, as well as how far above or below ground you are. Nothing happens if this function is used in a location without a magnetic north or a ground as a reference point.

### Rod of Rulership

*Rod, rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Royal scepter given as a prize

While holding this rod, you can use an action to command obedience. Each creature of your choice within 120 feet that you can see makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you for 8 hours. A creature charmed by you regards you as its trusted leader. The creature ceases to be charmed if you or your companions harm it or if you command it to do something contrary to its nature.

### Rod of Security

*Rod, legendary (cost 100,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Vessel abandoned by a genie, bread from a fey�s feast, wine from an angel�s cup

While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it and produce one of the following effects.

***Supply Storage.*** You target up to 20 Supply you can see within 5 feet. The Supply instantly vanishes and is stored inside the rod. The rod can store up to 200 Supply. You can�t use this ability in a paradise (see below).

A newly found rod has 2d100 Supply already stored.

***Paradise.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to activate it and expend an amount of Supply (1 per creature) for yourself and each willing creature you can see. You and the other creatures are instantly transported into an extradimensional haven that takes the form of any paradise you can imagine (or chosen at random using the Sample Paradises table). The paradise contains enough Supply to sustain its visitors for 24 hours. For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains 10 hit points.

Creatures don�t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Each day, you can maintain the extradimensional space for an additional 24 hours by expending an amount of Supply from the rod equal to the number of visitors.

Apart from visitors and the objects they brought into the paradise, everything within the paradise can only exist there. A cushion taken from a palace paradise, for example, disappears when taken outside.

When you expend the last Supply stored in the rod or use an action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or in the nearest unoccupied space, and the rod can�t be used again until 10 days have passed.

command it to halt. You can also command the rope to coil itself, knot itself, unknot itself, or fasten or unfasten itself.

While knotted, the rope shortens to 50 feet as knots appear at 1-foot intervals along its length. Creatures have advantage on checks made to climb the rope while it is knotted.

The rose has 10 petals. When it is activated, a number of petals drop from the rose equal to the level of the spell it is concentrating on. While the spell lasts, at the end of each minute an equal number of petals drop from the rose. When its last petal falls the rose wilts and its magic is lost.

Alternatively, if the rose is thrown against the ground, the magic inside of it implodes and frays magical energies in a 15-foot radius (as the *dispel magic* spell, gaining a bonus to any spellcasting ability checks equal to the rose�s number of petals).

transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you use another action to return to your normal form. While transformed, your Speed becomes 40 feet, you gain an expertise die on Acrobatics checks, and you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain.

**Crafting Components:** Handful of mixed seeds grown from a druid�s garden

A pouch of *seeds of necessity* contains 1d10 coin-sized seeds.

The dragon looks lifelike, and it occasionally flies, snaps at insects, and generally behaves in a dragon-like way. This illusion doesn�t hold up to physical scrutiny, and any creature that physically interacts with the dragon sees through the illusion with a successful DC 12 Investigation check. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the illusion.

As a bonus action, you can command the dragon to attack a creature within 5 feet of you. That creature makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) on a failure or half damage on a success. Once you�ve used this property, it can�t be used again for 24 hours.

### Sinner�s Ashes

*Wondrous item, common (cost 35 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Corpse of a humanoid creature that had the Evil trait

As an action, you can throw this urn up to 30 feet, where it shatters and produces a 20-foot-radius cloud of ash. The area is heavily obscured, and any creature that ends its turn within the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 necrotic damage. The cloud remains for 1 minute or until dispersed. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

Alternatively, the ashes can be used as an ingestible poison. The urn contains enough ashes for a single dose. A celestial that consumes the ashes makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 necrotic damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

### Slippers of Spider Climbing

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Giant spider silk While wearing these shoes, you can move on walls and upside down on ceilings without the use of your hands, gaining a climb speed equal to your Speed. The shoes can�t be used on slippery surfaces.

### Skeleton Key

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 145 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Spine of a humanoid that committed at least one major robbery

This key is shaped like a miniature skeleton holding a knife. As an action, you can use the knife to deal yourself 2d4 damage, which can�t be reduced or ignored in any way. If you do, the skeleton animates and walks towards the nearest locked door or object within 10 feet, then plunges itself into the lock and makes a thieves� tools check with a +10 bonus to pick the lock. Whether the skeleton succeeds or fails, it then walks back to you and returns to its inanimate form.

Alternatively, you can use an action to cover the skeleton in blood. When you do so, the skeleton walks to the nearest lock within 10 feet and unlocks it (as per the *knock* spell). The skeleton then dissolves into red mist.

### Skull Liqueur

*Potion, uncommon (cost 370 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Broth from zombie bones

Pouring the contents of this phial into the mouth of a dead creature animates the corpse as if it were the target of a *speak with dead* spell.

### Snake-Eye Bones

*Wondrous item, common (cost 55 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Skeleton of a venomous snake

No matter how many times this pair of

six-sided dice is thrown, the dice never nick or scuff, nor do their markings fade.

The dice have 2 charges and regain 1 charge each dawn. When you speak the command word as a bonus action as the dice are rolled, their results come up as double ones. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 5 or less, the dice roll double ones but both dice then crack in half, rendering both dice useless.

### Sonic Staff

*Weapon (quarterstaff), very rare (cost 9,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Tuning fork that has been struck by natural lightning

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. Attacks made with the staff deal double damage to doors and other objects. The staff constantly emits a

high-pitched whine that is uncomfortable to animals. Animals won�t willingly approach within 10 feet of the staff without a successful DC 22 Animal Handling check.

Once per day, you can use an action to slam the staff against the ground and generate a wave of thunder and force in

either a 10-foot radius or a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 3d6 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away. This effect can�t penetrate a *silence* spell or similar effects.

### Sovereign Glue

*Wondrous item, legendary (cost 85,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Glass bottle coated with *oil of slipperiness*, mucus from an amphibian fey

When found, this bottle contains 1d6 + 1 ounces of adhesive inside. You may use one ounce to cover a 1-foot square surface. After 1 minute passes the *sovereign glue* sets and the bond cannot be broken without using *universal solvent*, *oil of etherealness*, or a *wish* spell.

### Spellguard Shield

*Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement; cost 20,000 gp)*

### Spell Scroll

*Scroll, varies (cost 10�55,000 gp)*

Crafting Components: Varies

A *spell scroll* bears a spell within it. If the spell is on your class�s spell list, you can use the scroll to cast the spell (taking the spell�s normal casting time) without the need for material components. Otherwise, the *spell scroll* is unreadable to you. If you are interrupted while using the scroll, you can attempt to use it again. Once the spell within a scroll has been cast, the scroll crumbles away.

To use a *spell scroll* of a higher spell level than you can normally cast, you must succeed on spellcasting ability check (DC 10 + the spell�s level). On a failure, the magical energy within the scroll is expended with no effect, leaving behind a blank piece of parchment.

A wizard can use a *spell scroll* to copy the spell stored within to their spellbook by making an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + the spell�s level). Whether the check succeeds or not, the attempt destroys the *spell scroll*.

The level of the spell stored within a scroll determines the spell�s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll�s crafting components, cost, and rarity, as per the Spell Scrolls table. The costs of a *spell scroll* are in addition to any material components, which are required (and if necessary also consumed) when the scroll is made.

When you use one of these instruments to make a Performance check, you gain an expertise die (1d8). In addition to creating music of rare quality, the instruments allow you to cast spells as they are played and offer additional benefits as per the Spellcasting Symphony table.

### Sphere of Annihilation

*Wondrous item, legendary (cost 100,000 gp)*

**Crafting Materials:** Opal charged with positive planar energy, onyx charged with negative planar energy

This floating sphere of darkness is a 2-foot-diameter hole in reality that

eliminates all matter that comes into contact with it. Only artifacts can survive contact with the sphere, though some artifacts have a specific weakness to its properties.

Anything that the sphere touches or that touches it that isn�t instantly obliterated takes 4d10 force damage. The default state of the sphere is stationary, but a creature in the way of a moving sphere must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d10 force damage.

While within 60 feet of an uncontrolled *sphere of annihilation*, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check to take control of it. On a success, the sphere moves in the direction of your choice a number of feet equal to 5 � your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you instead. If the sphere is controlled by another creature, you can wrest away control by using an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the controlling creature. On a success, you take control of the sphere.

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal or extradimensional space (such as a *portable hole*), the Narrator rolls a d100: on 1�50 the sphere is destroyed, on 51�85 the sphere moves through the portal or into the space, and on 86�100 a rift forms that pulls in all creatures and objects within 180 feet. Each object and creature, including the sphere, reappears in a random plane of existence.

against a creature within reach. On a hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall into a magical slumber (as the *sleep* spell) for 2d4 hours. A sleeping creature awakens when it takes damage or if it hears a loud noise within 50 feet of it.

This enchanted slumber is infectious through touch. When a creature uses an action to try and shake or slap the sleeper awake, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall asleep for 1d4 hours.

The needle breaks when you roll a 1 on a weapon attack roll using it, dispersing its sleep magic in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall asleep.

You decide where the snake moves and what actions it takes, or you can issue it a general command, such as to guard a location.

As a bonus action, you can transform the snake back into a staff by repeating the command word. The staff appears in a space formerly occupied by the snake. If the snake has at least 1 hit point when it becomes a staff, it regains all its hit points.

***Thunder and Lightning.*** You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties simultaneously. This doesn�t expend the uses of those properties, only this one.

### Staff of Withering

*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Remains of a creature killed by the *blight* spell

This magic quarterstaff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges at dawn.

### Star Heart

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 76,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Corpse of a darkmantle and metal that has fallen from space

Once you are attuned to the *star heart*, it attaches to your skin over your heart. As long as you have at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes. If you lose a body part, over the next 1d6 + 1 days the part completely regrows and regains full functionality, provided you have at least 1 hit point throughout that time.

In addition, after 1d4 + 3 days, any body part you lose grows into an entirely new version of yourself, complete with your personality, memory, and abilities. This clone is independent and sentient, although it is incapable of further duplication. Each time a clone is created, one of the *star heart�s* five legs withers and dies, although the *star heart* regrows that leg if the associated clone dies.

If all five of the *star heart�s* legs grow into clones, the *star heart* is destroyed.

***Curse.*** Every time the *star heart* creates a clone, roll a d20 and consult the Star Heart Clone table. On a result of 12 or higher, roll again and apply all effects.

**TABLE: STAR HEART CLONE**

There is a darkness within the clone that makes it want to replace you. No matter how perfect the copy, the clone always attacks you on sight with the intent to kill (at the Narrator�s discretion, the clone might delay such an act if it would be immediately beneficial to the clone�once the benefit is gone, the bloodlust returns). The clone plots

20 against you when not in your presence, hiring assassins or otherwise attempting to vex or destroy you.

|  |
| --- |
| **D20 EFFECT** |
| 1 The clone is an exact copy of you (unless affected by previous rolls) but is lifeless. |
| Nothing. The clone is an exact copy of you, although the clone lacks any scars or  2�11 imperfections you have that regeneration  didn�t remove. |
| The clone is an exact copy of you, but its 12�1 mind has been permanently warped by the  3 regeneration process. It rolls once on the Long-Term Mental Stress Effects table. |
| The clone is an exact copy of you, but something has changed in its personality.  14�1 The clone might choose to pursue a different  5 class or profession than you. The first time  each day the clone sees you, it must  succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom check or suffer a short-term mental stress effect. |
| Something is off. The clone might have different colored eyes or hair, new birthmarks or blemishes, or other minor differences (such as a different score in one or two  16�1 abilities). Such differences are easy to hide  7 and can be difficult to spot. These  differences prey on the clone�s mind when it  is near you. The first time each day the clone sees you, it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom check or suffer a short-term mental stress effect. |
| The clone is obviously imperfect. At the Narrator�s discretion, the clone might be noticeably shorter, taller, heavier, or lighter  18 than you. The clone has disadvantage on attempts to disguise itself as you. The first  time each day the clone sees you, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom check or suffer a long-term mental stress effect. |
| The clone is effectively a reincarnation of you. Roll on the Reincarnation table for the *reincarnation* spell to determine the clone�s  19 heritage. The first time each day the clone sees you, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom check or suffer a long-term mental stress effect. |

Note that particular mental stress effects don�t stack. For example, if the clone has both a personality change and develops a phobia, it only needs to make a single DC 14 Wisdom check when it sees you.

An unliving rune is a Tiny construct of negative energy resembling a splotch of darkly glowing ink. The rune can be applied to your skin much like a temporary tattoo.

While the rune is attached, you can channel negative energy into an attack. When you hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to activate the rune, dealing an additional 1d4 necrotic damage and preventing the target from regaining hit points until the start of your next turn. You can�t do so again until you finish a rest.

The rune feeds on your vitality while attached to your skin. You gain a slightly sickly appearance, and the rune consumes one of your Hit Dice each dawn. During a short rest, you can deal yourself 1d6 necrotic damage to peel the rune off your skin. While unattached, the rune can be stored in a book instead of your skin, but it offers no benefit unless attached to you.

When exposed to direct sunlight for a minute or more, the rune is destroyed.

As an action, you can place the rune on a humanoid corpse that has died within the last 8 hours. The rune is destroyed as its magic is absorbed by the corpse, which then animates as a **zombie**. When placing the rune, you can feed it a portion of your life force by spending hit points. The zombie obeys your spoken commands and is friendly to you and your companions for 1 round per hit point you spend while placing the rune. At the end of this duration, the

zombie becomes hostile to all living creatures.

***Curse.*** While you are attached to the *unliving rune*, any senses or divinations that detect undead incorrectly identify you as undead. If you die while the rune is attached to you, you are reanimated as a **zombie** after 1d4 rounds.

When you use this sword to make an attack against a creature and roll a natural 20 on the attack roll, the sword makes a snicker-snack sound as it chops off one of the target�s heads. If the creature can�t survive without its head, it dies. This property doesn�t function if the target is too big for its head to be removed by the sword (as determined by the Narrator), if it doesn�t have a head or doesn�t need one, if it has immunity to slashing damage, or if it has legendary actions. In such cases, the target instead takes an additional 6d8 slashing damage (unless it is immune to slashing damage; this extra damage does not double).

you.

**TABLE: WAND OF WONDER**

|  |
| --- |
| 85�87 Leaves grow from the target. If you targeted a point in space, leaves sprout from the creature closest to that point instead. The leaves fall off after 24 hours but can be pruned before that time. |
| 88�90 A stream of 1d4 � 10 gems (each worth 1 gp) shoots from the wand in a 30-foot-long,  5-foot-wide line. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage. Divide the total damage equally among all creatures in the area. |
| 91�95 A burst of shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature that can see in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. |
| 96�97 For the next 1d10 days, the target can breathe underwater, and its skin turns blue. If you targeted an object or a point in space, the creature nearest that target is affected instead. |
| 98�10 If you targeted a creature, it makes a DC 15  0 Constitution saving throw. If you didn�t target a creature, you become the target instead. On a failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. A creature that fails the initial saving throw by 5 or more is instantly petrified. A *greater restoration* spell or similar magic restores a petrified creature, but otherwise the effect is permanent. |

|  |
| --- |

| 31�33 Rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target, making the area lightly obscured until the start of your next turn. |
| 34�36 A beast appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the target. You don�t control the animal, which acts as it normally would. Roll a d4 to determine the beast (1: **rhinoceros**, 2: **elephant**, 3�4: **rat**). |
| 37�46 You cast *lightning bolt*. |
| 47�49 Butterflies fill a 30-foot radius centered on the target, making the area heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes. |
| 50�53 The target doubles in size (as if you had cast *enlarge/reduce*). If the target is a point in space or an attended object, you become the spell�s target instead. |
| 54�58 You cast *darkness*. |
| 59�62 Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. Existing grass grows to 10 times normal size for 1 minute, becoming difficult terrain. |
| 63�65 An unattended object (chosen by the Narrator) within 120 feet of the target disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be able to fit in a 10-foot cube. |

### Waystone

*Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp each)*

**Crafting Components:** Stone kept in a traveler�s pocket throughout a journey of at least 100 miles

When one or more *waystones* are kept in contact with each other for at least an hour, they become linked and magnetically attracted to each other for 7 days per hour the stones remained in contact. While holding a *waystone*, you can use an action to speak the stone�s command word, causing it to be drawn toward the nearest *waystone* within 5 miles. If the *waystone* is linked, it is instead drawn to the nearest *waystone* linked to it, regardless of distance. Linked *waystones* are only able to sense each other. Once activated, the *waystone�s* attraction lasts until the next dawn.

A *waystone* has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge at dawn. You can expend 1 charge to speak the stone�s command word to increase an unlinked *waystone*�s range to 25 miles. If you expend the last charge, the *waystone* becomes a mundane object.

**Crafting Components:** Tuning fork that has been attuned to each of the planes of existence

When unfolded, this handkerchief-sized piece of lightweight, silky fabric expands into a 6-foot-diameter circular sheet.

You can use an action to unfold the cloth and spread it on a solid surface, creating a two-way portal to another plane of existence chosen by the Narrator. You can use an action to close the portal by folding the cloth. Once a portal has been opened in this manner, it can�t be opened again for 1d8 hours.

### Wig of Styling

*Wondrous item, common (cost 15 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Full head of hair shaved from an elf

This wig has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. While wearing the wig, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to change the length, style, and color of the wig. If you expend the wig�s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wig is fixed in its current length, style, and color, becoming a mundane object.

### Wind Fan

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 450 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Air from the Plane of Air, gilded songbird feather

You can use an action to wave this fan to cast *gust of wind* (save DC 13). Each time the fan is used before the next dawn, there is a cumulative 20 percent chance that the fan shreds into nonmagical pieces, causing the spell to fail.

### Winged Boots

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 1,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Couatl feather While wearing these boots, you gain a fly speed equal to your Speed, and you can hover. You can use the boots to fly for up to 2 hours, expending at least 10 minutes� worth of time with each use. If you�re flying when the time runs out, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round and take no damage upon landing.

The boots regain 1 hour of flying time for every 12 hours they�re not in use.

### Wings of Flying

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 3,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Nalfeshnee feather or planetar feather

While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word and transform the cloak into a pair of wings. The wings last for 1 hour or until you use an action to speak the command word to dismiss them. While the wings are activated, you gain a fly speed of 60 feet.

After being used in this way, the wings disappear and can�t be used again for 2d6 hours.

### Wood Woad Amulet

*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement, cost 90 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Wooden road sign stolen from a crossroads

When you hold this amulet to your ear, you hear faint whispers. As an action, you can hold the amulet to your ear and let its whispers guide you. You gain an expertise die to one ability check you make in the next minute. You can roll the expertise die before or after making the ability check, after which the effect ends. Once you use this property, it can�t be used again until the next dusk.

Alternatively, when you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use a reaction to crush the amulet to gain the �woad�s blessing.� If you do, roll an additional d20 and use either result. You can roll the additional die after making the roll, but you must choose to do so before the outcome is determined. Once you�ve used this property, the amulet�s magic dissipates.

### Zlick�s Message Cushion

*Wondrous item, common (cost 45 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Written joke responsible for at least 1 minute of genuine laughter

While holding this small pink air bladder, you can use a bonus action to whisper a phrase up to 10 words long into the cushion, which will inflate it. While inflated, any creature that accidentally sits on or applies pressure to the cushion deflates it. A creature can also use a bonus action to intentionally deflate the cushion. When the cushion deflates, it loudly repeats the phrase spoken into it along with somewhat humorous flatulence noise. This sound is audible to a range of 50 feet.

Alternatively, you can cast a cantrip or 1st-level spell into the *Zlick�s message cushion*, provided the word �laughter,� �mockery,� or �whisper� is in the spell�s

name. When deflated, the cushion casts the spell, targeting the creature that deflated it. Once the spell is cast, the cushion becomes a mundane object.

## Sentient Magic Items

Some magic items are sentient and sapient, possessed by a spirit or given life through arcane power. Despite their outward appearances these objects are full fledged characters with their own agendas, desires, and personalities. Unless otherwise specified, sentient items are NPCs under the Narrator�s control, and adventurers must negotiate with and become allies to them rather than simply use them as items. A sentient item�s properties and abilities are under their own control rather than the wielder�s, and accessing them requires the item�s willing cooperation.

### Ability Scores

Sentient magic items have a mind and so also possess mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). Each sentient item has these ability scores defined in their descriptions, and is capable of making checks and saving throws just like any other creature.

Unless otherwise specified, sentient magic items don�t possess a typical body and thus usually don�t have Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. These sentient items automatically fail any checks or saving throws made for these ability scores.

### Durability and Hit Points

Most magic items are already far more durable than their mundane counterparts but the enchantments required to encapsulate a sentient mind must be steadfastly reinforced. Some sentient magic items have hit points listed within their description along with other statistics normal for a creature. Sentient magic items without hit points can only be broken by special and

specific means detailed within the item�s description.

### Senses and Communication

Sentient magic items rely on magical senses and forms of communication that can vary wildly between items. Some items may be able to communicate telepathically with their wielder or see with extranormal senses, or they may be severely limited in their capacity to interact with the world around them. Each sentient magic item�s description details its unique sense and communication abilities. Unless otherwise specified, assume that a sentient magic item can at least speak and understand Common, and can see and hear its surroundings as a typical humanoid creature would.

### Personality and Conflict

Just like any NPC, sentient magic items have their own unique personality. Some have very specific goals in mind, while others may operate on guidelines or ideals. Sentient magic items can be as deep and complex as any character with intricate backstories and motivations that cannot be summarized by a single attribute or phrase. However, most sentient magic items have some issue or trait that can lead to conflict.

While a sentient magic item and a creature wielding it are not in conflict, the wielder has access to the abilities and properties of the sentient magic item.

While a sentient magic item and a creature wielding it are in conflict, the wielder may lose access to some or all of the sentient magic item�s abilities, and the sentient magic item may even be able to inflict additional negative effects or influence the wielder�s actions.

Exactly what leads to conflict, what happens during conflict, and how these conflicts can be resolved depends on the personality of the sentient magic item (detailed in its description).

For example, a lance containing the soul of a righteous cleric might deal radiant damage to its wielder whenever it is used to commit an evil act, and will refuse to function for that wielder until that evil act is atoned for. Alternatively, a staff haunted by an arrogant wizard may refuse to attune to a wielder unless flattered with a high Charisma check, forcibly ending the attunement if it feels unappreciated or insulted.

### Creating Sentient Magic Items

Creating a sentient magic item has elements of both character creation and item creation. Use the Backgrounds, Cultures, and perhaps even the Destinies in Chapter 2: Origins to develop their personality and the information elsewhere in this chapter to create the sentient magic item�s traits and other statistics. In addition, make sure to include the following features:

**Sentience:** Include the item�s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The Narrator can simply select these scores or determine them randomly by rolling 4d6 for each, dropping the lowest roll and totalling the rest.

Then, describe how the item communicates and what languages it knows. Some common forms of communication include:

* Telepathy with the wielder or others.
* An actual audible voice.
* Vague impulses and feelings empathically transmitted.

Finally you�ll need to describe how aware the item is of its surroundings:

* Vision common to most humanoids.
* Darkvision.
* Blindsight.
* Shared awareness using the wielder�s senses.

**Personality:** The description of a sentient item�s personality can be a simple list of traits or as extensive as a full backstory.

Whatever level of detail, the Narrator needs at least some indication of the item�s motivations, what will bring the item into conflict, the repercussions of conflict and how to resolve it.

Common causes of conflict include:

* Going directly against the item�s values.
* Fighting against creatures aligned with

the item.

* Insulting or causing the item injury.

Common repercussions of conflict include:

* Damaging the wielder.
* Blocking access to one or more of the

item�s features.

* Attempting to control the wielder temporarily through a battle of wills, resolved with a contested Charisma check.
* Forcibly ending attunement.

Common resolutions of conflict include:

* Apologizing with a high Persuasion check.
  + Bringing current actions back in line with the item�s values.
  + Performing tasks or favors that benefit

the item.

## Sample Sentient Items

### Eye of Elsewhere

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 55,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

This gray stone orb is carved into the likeness and size of a disquietingly realistic human eye with a ruby iris. Once you have attuned to it you can use an action to set the eye in a gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature may use an action to try and take an orbiting eye, but must make a melee attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The eye�s AC is 24, it has 30 hit points, and resistance to all damage. While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an action to seize and stow the eye, returning it to an inert and inactive state.

While the eye is actively orbiting your head, your Intelligence score increases by 2 (to a maximum of 22), you gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks and Perception checks, and you cannot be surprised or blinded.

**Innate Arcane Eye.** While the eye orbits your head, you know and can innately cast *arcane eye* without expending a spell slot or the need for material components.

**Shared Paranoia.** After you have attuned to the eye and it has been and active for 24 hours, you develop a paranoia that persists as long as it remains active. While paranoid you have

disadvantage on Insight checks and you are considered roughing it if you sleep in the same room or tent as another humanoid creature.

**Sentience.** The eye is a sentient construct with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 8. It cannot hear, but has blindsight and darkvision to a range of 60 feet. The eye communicates with you and other creatures within 60 feet telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Abyssal, Common, Deep Speech, and Undercommon.

**Personality**. The *eye of elsewhere* contains the soul of something utterly alien to humanoid perceptions, betrayed and plunged into a constrained form. It is constantly paranoid and convinced that some worse fate could befall it at any moment. Once attuned it will try to learn everything and anything you know, especially secrets. If you are forthcoming with information the eye grows to trust you, but can be brought into conflict if you withhold any information. When in conflict the eye shuts and you no longer gain any of the eye�s benefits or properties except for Shared Paranoia. The eye only opens again if you divulge an important secret or the information initially withheld.

**Destroying the Eye**. The eye is unbreakable but it has the power to implode and disintegrate itself. Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces the eye that some horrifying and frightening threat is inevitably soon to befall it. Rather than accept its fate, the eye destroys itself and blinks out of existence. On a failed check, the creature permanently loses the eye�s trust and the eye will never attune to it or be convinced by its Deception checks.

### Fellow Candlestick

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 3,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

This golden candlestick is sentient but will only light when held by someone it is friendly with�perhaps that someone is you. Whether or not the candlestick will accept you as an ally is at the Narrator�s discretion, though it is highly recommended to keep it well-polished and speak to it once per day to encourage a long-lasting friendship. Once you have befriended the candlestick you are able to attune to it.

While you are attuned to the candlestick, you can use a bonus action to politely ask it to light itself or extinguish its flame. If another force extinguishes its flame, the candlestick relights itself at the start of your next turn unless told otherwise.

**Hydrophobic.** The candlestick does not like exposure to water or having its candle replaced, and when either occurs it stops functioning for you until you make a DC 14 Persuasion check to earn its forgiveness.

**Sentience.** The candlestick is a sentient construct with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 10, and Charisma 18. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The candlestick communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfling. It cannot read (or perhaps it is simply disinterested in doing so).

**Personality**. The candlestick�s purpose is to provide ample lighting for its wielder and snuff itself out should the cover of darkness be required. It is sympathetic to those in need of assistance but demands to be treated with a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.

**Destroying the Candlestick**. When reduced to 0 hit points, the candlestick pours its remaining heart and soul into creating one last burst of flames before becoming a mundane item. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the candlestick must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Swiping Flame.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage and the target makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or catches fire, taking 2 (1d4) ongoing fire damage. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

### Harvest

*Weapon (sickle), legendary (requires attunement by a druid or ranger; cost 60,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

This seems like nothing more than a simple tool at first, rough at the handle and rusted at the edges, but the sickle�s impossibly sharp and shining crescent blade reveals its true nature.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sickle. It has the following additional properties.

**Red Reaping.** Whenever you use *Harvest* to reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs that creature�s soul and stores it within. *Harvest* cannot store more than one soul in this way and the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit points while a creature�s soul is already contained within it are not affected by this property.

**Sow the Reaped.** You can use an action to strike the ground with the sickle and produce a blood clone using a creature�s soul stored within *Harvest.* This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones formed in this way act immediately after you in initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to the best of their ability.

Without such commands, the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed, a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10 minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever afterlife was intended for it.

**Only Life May Die.** *Harvest* has no effect on unliving creatures, and passes

harmlessly through constructs and undead when it is used to attack them.

**Sentience.** *Harvest* is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17. It sees and hears using your senses. *Harvest* communicates with only you telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is not attuned to.

**Personality**. *Harvest* has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. *Harvest* tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its �culling�. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth�s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using *Harvest* to slay a sentient creature, you�ll be in conflict with *Harvest*. When in conflict, any time you use the *Sow the Reaped* property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into *Harvest*.

**Destroying Harvest**. *Harvest* is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering *Harvest* an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade.

### Skrivena Moc, Whispering Blade

*Weapon (longsword), legendary (cost 80,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

A huge red ruby is set into the pommel of this intricately filigreed golden longsword. The jewel shimmers and shines as the blade speaks in a voice that resonates with a deep and distant baritone. Without this illusion, a twisted demonic form is revealed: the blade is composed of a single sharpened tooth, what appears to be the hilt is instead a grotesque sucker-like mouth, and the ruby pommel is a figment covering a single great crimson eye that stares with fiendish intelligence.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic longsword. An intense burning heat radiates from the blade and it deals an extra 3d6 fire damage on a successful hit.

**Attached Properties.** While attached to *Skrivena Moc*, you gain resistance to fire, proficiency with longswords, and after taking the Attack action on your turn you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using it. However, the weapon forms a permanent bond with its wielder and cannot be put down or removed once wielded.

**Corruption.** At the end of each week that *Skrivena Moc* is attached to you, your Charisma score is decreased by 1d4.

When you have lost 6 or more Charisma in this way, raised black veins radiate out from the point of *Skrivena Moc*�s attachment. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until *Skrivena Moc* is no longer attached to you, at which point you recover 1 Charisma at the end of each long rest.

**Fiend Transformed.** This elegantly crafted longsword of filigreed gold whispers promises of greater treasures to come�yet those who wield it are doomed. In truth it is an imprisoned balor reduced in power by potent enchantments, the elegant blade only an illusion. Any that dare grasp the infernal hilt know not their peril, unaware they are actually plunging their hand into a fiendish maw.

***Sentience.*** *Skrivena Moc* is a sentient construct with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 16, and Charisma 22. It has hearing and truesight to a range of 120 feet. The longsword communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Abyssal, Common, and up to 3 other languages of the Narrator�s choice.

***Personality.*** *Skrivena Moc* needs a wielder to accomplish much of anything and it is a peerless manipulator. Wrathful and vindictive, the fiend blade sees those who carry it as insignificant and a means to an end. However it has been stuck in this form for centuries and has learned to maintain a helpful and subservient fa�ade to better facilitate the careful orchestration of events whenever possible, only revealing its true intentions as a last resort. Once wielded, the fiend blade grabs hold and cannot be dropped. The demon makes hasty apologies for its �curse�, manipulating its wielder into serving its will�it acts as a powerful weapon but slowly drains away their vital essences until they die, all the while using them to track down potential cures for its transformation.

***Death Throes.*** When Skrivena Moc dies it explodes and each creature within 30 feet of it make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success. The explosion ignites unattended flammable objects in the area.

Any creature currently attached to Skrivena Moc has disadvantage on this save.

***Demonic Blade.*** While Skrivena Moc is attached to a creature, the creature gains the attached template.

***Immobile.*** Skrivena Moc has been magically forced into the form of a blade and is unable to move on its own. It is considered restrained and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws.

***Magic Resistance.*** Skrivena Moc has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Prized Glamer.*** Skrivena Moc has an illusion around it that makes it look and feel like a golden longsword. Creatures who physically interact with the figment can determine that the sword is glamered with a DC 22 Arcana or Investigation check. Skrivena Moc can use a bonus action to activate or dismiss this illusion.

***Variable Challenge Rating.*** Skrivena Moc�s CR is equal to its wielder�s level or CR (min. CR 4).

ACTIONS

***Corrupting Siphon (Recharge 5�6).*** The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or reduces its Charisma by 2 (1d4). Skrivena Moc regains 1d8 hit points for each point of Charisma lost in this way. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until Skrivena Moc is no longer attached to the creature, at which point it recovers 1 Charisma at the end of each long rest.

***Demonic Leeching (3/Day).*** Skrivena Moc uses its natural resistances to filter out its wielder�s ailments, ending either the poisoned condition or one nonmagical disease afflicting the attached creature.

***Grip of Control.*** The creature attached to Skrivena Moc must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or temporarily lose control to the fiend blade until the end of Skrivena Moc�s next turn (as *dominate person*).

***Trusty Blade.*** The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is charmed for the next hour. If the attached creature�s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

REACTIONS

***Fiendish Attachment.*** When a creature grasps Skrivena Moc�s hilt, it can use reaction to attach to the creature. Once attached, the creature cannot let go and is forced to wield Skrivena Moc with whatever limb it used to grab the hilt. Skrivena Moc can use an action to detach from a creature and otherwise detaches when it dies, the attached limb is severed, or if it is dealt 35 or more radiant damage in a single round.

***Justified Paranoia.*** Whenever Skrivena Moc hears its name mentioned or is otherwise suspicious of a creature, it can use its reaction to telepathically delve into the creature�s mind (as *detect thoughts*; save DC 19).

The Traveling Chest

*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 52,000 gp)*

Crafting Components: Unique (uncraftable)

This large chest has an interior space 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall, and appears mundane save that the wood used in its construction is normally reserved for making magic wands. Its magical properties become apparent however when it moves, as it stands on hundreds of tiny humanoid legs and opens to reveal a long red tongue and a rim dotted with sharp teeth. It functions like a typical chest with the following additional properties.

***Mimic-Like.*** *The Traveling Chest* can use an action to appear to be a mundane chest, and you can verbally command it to do so. While mimicking a normal chest in this way it is indistinguishable from its mundane counterpart.

***Multiple Interiors.*** *The Traveling Chest* has 1,000 different interior spaces, each 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall. You can verbally request any particular space (such as the last one, or the one with my laundry in it) and when opened the chest reveals that interior. Otherwise the chest opens to reveal a random interior space. While the chest is closed, all of its interior spaces are located within separate pocket dimensions. These pocket dimensions have no air, and any Supply stored within them instantly deteriorates and rots as if decades have passed as soon as the chest is closed. Only you can summon up the other interiors in this way, and any other creature that opens the chest only finds the �first interior�.

***Relentless.*** Once you attune to *The Traveling Chest*, it relentlessly follows you until it sits no more than 15 feet away from you. The chest is magically aware of your location at all times, even if you are on a separate plane. If separated from you the chest travels towards you as fast as it can to the best of its ability and it attacks any creature that attempts to hinder its progress. If you are functionally unreachable, such as being on a different plane or across an ocean, the chest still progresses using even esoteric or hidden methods of reaching you such as magic portals or stowing away on ships headed in your direction.

***Imprinted.*** *The Traveling Chest* does not relinquish attunement once attuned, and you cannot voluntarily remove this attunement. If you attune to additional magic items beyond your limit, *The Traveling Chest* always remains as one of your attuned items.

***Pack Lightly.*** *The Traveling Chest* does not like being weighed down too much, and can carry a maximum of 10 bulky items. Any additional bulky items you attempt to store within it are spit out.

***Sentience.*** *The Traveling Chest* is a sentient construct with Intelligence 3, Wisdom 14, and Charisma 12. It has blindsight to a range of 60 feet. *The Traveling Chest* cannot speak or read, but it understands Common and Elvish. *The Traveling Chest* lacks proper communication, but can animalistically communicate simple emotions (most often boredom or rage).

***Personality***. *The Traveling Chest* has the intellect and temperament of a poorly trained dog. Loyalty has been branded magically into its psyche but its actual obedience is looser. The chest is playful and quick to anger, yet is utterly

committed to following whomever is attuned to it. It also isn�t a fighter and ignores outright commands to attack, though it defends itself in combat when it is attacked. It likes to be used for its intended purpose, happiest when numerous items are stored within it and regularly retrieved. If left idle or unused for more than a day it will come into conflict. While in conflict the chest intentionally opens to the wrong interior spaces, or remains indignantly locked, and it generally acts snippy and uncooperative. An apology and DC 14 Animal Handling or Persuasion check calms the chest down and ends the conflict, or if it feels genuinely mistreated, it can be offered a full wardrobe�s worth of new clothing to store as a peace offering.

**THE TRAVELING CHEST** CHALLENGE 7 MEDIUM CONSTRUCT 2,900 XP

**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor) **Hit Points** 119 (14d6+70) **Speed** 50 ft.

***False Appearance.*** While *The Traveling Chest* remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary chest.

***Immutable Form.*** The chest is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

ACTION

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8+4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the chest can�t bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The chest makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite�s damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the chest, and it begins suffocating at the start of each of the chest�s turns. If the chest takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the chest regurgitates all swallowed creatures along with up to 1d10 other random items that were stored within it, all of which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the chest. If the chest dies, all swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it, and they and any items reappear randomly in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the destroyed chest.

## Artifacts

In a world of flaming swords and cursed axes, some magical items are on a level above and beyond what can be found in a wizard�s tower or a demon�s lair. These potent relics are the stuff of bard tales and cultural epics, unique and powerful items that leave marks upon history and spawn legends in their wake�when one of them is found, it can easily signal major changes felt far and wide.

The appearance of an artifact in a campaign is not to be taken lightly. Artifacts are not typically found by everyday adventurers and are as much plot points as they are equipment. The search for an artifact can be the goal of an entire adventure or long term quest: to reclaim it from a villain, to traverse the dangerous demiplane of a demigod and acquire it, or even keeping it from two factions in a stalemate war.

### Recognizing Artifacts

Due to their eminent place in history and the countless tales told about them, artifacts can often be recognized even without anyone realizing everything about the item. Success on an ability check to recognize an artifact reveals something from its Legends and Lore, but not anything a typical check to identify a magic item would reveal.

### Artifact Properties

Artifacts have properties like other magical items, but these are of a greater magnitude than what the average adventurer will come across in their lifetime. In addition to their inherent abilities, artifacts may have other properties that can be either beneficial or detrimental, either chosen by the Narrator from the following tables or randomly determined. Properties such as these often shift each time an artifact appears and are not permanent. Narrators are also encouraged to create new properties.

Artifact properties are either benefits or detriments and have one of two intensities (lesser or greater). An artifact can only have a maximum of four lesser benefits and two greater benefits, and no more than four lesser detriments and two greater detriments.

Unless otherwise noted, the following properties apply when you have attuned to an artifact and are wielding it or have it on your person. Any cantrips or spells granted by an artifact are chosen by the Narrator.

| 61�65 ***Psychic Scream.*** The mental feedback from this artifact deals 4d10 psychic damage after you attune to it. |
| 66�70 ***Path of Filth.*** Slime collects in a trail behind you. Creatures have advantage on checks made to track you. |
| 71�75 ***Fickle Fate.*** The first time you attune to this item, an enemy of the Narrator�s choice experiences a stroke of good fortune. The Narrator is encouraged to let you know exactly how your attunement has advanced your enemy�s goals. |

| 81�85 ***Double Trouble.*** A nearly perfect duplicate of you appears within 90 feet. Your duplicate has the goal of killing you to claim your existence.

| 86�90 ***Stolen Voice.*** You lose the ability to speak. |
| 91�95 ***Weakness.*** The artifact weakens your body and mind. You become vulnerable to all types of damage. |
| 96�10 ***Divine Reclamation.*** When you attune to this  0 artifact there is a 10% chance that you attract the attention of a divine authority who sends an avatar to take it from you. The avatar vanishes with the artifact if it is successful in reclaiming it. |

### Destroying an Artifact

The very heart of legends rests in the hands of the adventurers, yet they could well seek to destroy it�such a task might not be folly but absolutely necessary. The destruction of such a powerful magical item is a matter of a campaign�s plot, and otherwise artifacts are indestructible. Despite the enormous power they wield however, every artifact has its own weakness (though finding and utilizing such a vulnerability may be a quest in itself, as can stopping a villain from destroying an artifact).

While the Narrator decides how a particular artifact can be destroyed, here are some suggestions:

* Fulfill an ancient prophecy�or defy one.
* Return it to its place of origin or creator to make it vulnerable to damage.
* Ritual that takes place at a sacred site in an opposite aligned plane.
* Thrown into a specific volcano tied to

its power.

* If sentient, it may desire an appropriate ritual or location to create a body of its own, leaving the artifact to dissipate into dust.

### Ancient Broom

*Weapon (club), artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

Subtle power is contained within this ancient oak staff and its coarse bristles, and though it appears as if any amount of rough handling will break this broom only the most

potent blades have any chance of harming it. The broom�s handle is said to have come from the first tree and the bristles stolen from a god, but its beginnings are far more humble�just a simple mundane object that accrued its first enchantment by chance after years of exposure to countless rituals. Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names. Only the feats of magic they achieved are of any worth to the broom.

***Sentience.*** The broom is a sentient construct with Intelligence 19, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 17. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The broom communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon.

***Personality***. The broom�s purpose is to encourage the use of magic�the more powerful the better�regardless of any consequences. It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.

***Demands.*** If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick). In addition, the broom is a repository of magic over the ages and it strongly encourages you to seek out monsters to harvest powerful reagents, explore cursed ruins in search of forbidden knowledge, and undertake precarious rituals.

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the magic broom, and when the broom deals damage with a critical hit the target is blinded until the end of your next turn.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Ancient Broom*, used by spellcasters since the dawn of time.

**DC 18** The broom is able to animate itself and attack your enemies, it has the power to open locks and break shackles, and it enables you to move without leaving a trace of your passing.

**DC 21** Many of those who have wielded the *Ancient Broom* came from humble and unlikely backgrounds.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Ancient Broom* has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.

#### Magic

While you are attuned to the broom you gain an expertise die on checks made with Arcana, and while holding it you can innately cast *pass without trace* (no concentration required) and *nondetection* at will.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to knock the broom against a lock, door, lid, chains, shackles, or the like to open them. Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a short rest, learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.

#### Dancing Broom

In addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle.

When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or invisible it has advantage on its attack roll.

While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the broom to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.

The broom ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.

### Cane of Chaos

*Staff, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

The *Cane of Chaos* (known by some by its fairytale name, the Little Silver Stick) is a gorgeous silver scepter etched with fractals, adorned with an eight-pointed star, and imbued with the power of chaos.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Cane of Chaos*, used by a despot in times long past. It is also known as the Little Silver Stick.

**DC 18** The cane stores and is able to cast spells linked to chaos, but randomly unleashes chaotic magical effects when used.

**DC 21** The cane can only be destroyed by a sovereign on the day of their coronation.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Cane of Chaos* has 1d4 lesser artifact benefits, 1d4 lesser artifact detriments, 1d4�1 greater artifact benefits, and 1d4 + 1 greater artifact detriments.

In addition, the cane has the finesse property and can be used as a double weapon which you become proficient with when you attune to it. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls and damage rolls made using the *Cane of Chaos*.

#### Magic

While you use this quarterstaff as a spell focus, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC. You know and have prepared all spells of the chaos school of magic (but not their rare versions).

The *Cane of Chaos* begins with a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus and regains 1d6 charges each dawn (to a maximum number of charges equal to your level + 1, or your CR + 1) . You can expend any number of charges from the cane to cast a chaos spell, which costs a number of charges equal to the spell�s level. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).

When you expend charges from the *Cane of Chaos*, it unleashes another chaotic magical effect, either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined.

#### Destroying the Cane

The *Cane of Chaos* is born from the very essence of rebellion. To destroy it, you must offer the artifact as a gift to a sovereign on the day of their coronation or to a magical being with the Lawful alignment trait on the anniversary of their advent. If accepted as such a gift, the *Cane of Chaos* melts into a puddle of ordinary molten silver.

**TABLE: CANE OF CHAOS**

|  |
| --- |
| **D8 WILD MAGIC EFFECT** |
| 1 One random creature you see is subject to a *polymorph* spell cast by the cane (using your spell save DC), turning it into a random CR 1/8 beast. |
| 2 The 1d6 doors nearest to you come under an *arcane lock* effect as though cast by the creature nearest to you that can speak, write, or sign at least one language. |
| 3 The cane creates a *control weather* effect, driving the weather towards unseasonable extreme temperatures and conditions. |
| 4 Each creature within 60 feet rolls 1d6, increasing a random ability score to 18 for the next 10 minutes (1: Strength, 2: Dexterity, 3:  Constitution, 4: Intelligence, 5: Wisdom, 6: Charisma). |
| 5 Each creature within 60 feet is subject to a *levitation* effect created by the cane (using your spell save DC). Each creature has disadvantage on saving throws against the effect and on a failure immediately rises 60 feet. For the duration, each creature can control its own movement as though it had cast *levitation* on itself. |
| 6 You grow 1d6 inches taller (this effect cannot increase your size category). |
| 7 If you are a humanoid you are permanently transformed into a different humanoid heritage (as per Table: Reincarnation for the *reincarnate* spell in Chapter 10: Spellcasting, in the *Adventurere's Guide* ). |
| 8 Duplicates of yourself appear within 60 feet! Roll 1d6 to determine their nature (1�2: 1d6 animated armors, 3�4: a *mirror image* effect, 5�6: a *simulacrum* effect). |

### Crafter�s Codex

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

Centuries ago, a famed artificer published her masterwork treatise on crafting magic items�humbly titled *Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things*�and the work was so revolutionary that every serious library simply had to have a copy. The work still influences the art of crafting magic items to this day.

A regular copy of *Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things* is a masterwork book about crafting magic items. Yet a fabled version of this tome is said to meander through literary circles�a copy annotated by a mad genius. Known as the *Crafter�s Codex*, this copy of the book is dog-eared throughout and stuffed to the brim with exceedingly peculiar, illegible marginalia. To the person approaching the book through the right means (such as refracting the text through a beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one�s own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step instructions which streamline and improve the enchantments described within. Alas, no owner seems to hold on to the *Crafter�s Codex* for long. The book itself appears to hyperfixate on a given reader and then simply disappear, presumably in search of someone more suited to its talents and disposition.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Crafter�s Codex*, a legendary book containing secrets of crafting magical items that can unsettle even the strongest minds.

**DC 18** This book is a unique annotated version of the more common Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things.

**DC 21** The *Crafter�s Codex* can only be destroyed by destroying every copy of *Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things* that exists in the multiverse.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Crafter�s Codex* has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. While attuned to this book, you gain an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the usual requirements related to crafting a magic item aside from its cost.

In addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented

around inventing, the *Crafter�s Codex*, or keeping the book safely in your possession.

Once between long rests, while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the *Crafter�s Codex* and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, choose one of the following:

* Reduce research time by 75%.
* Reduce component cost by 75%.
* Reduce crafting time by 75%.
* Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.
* Reduce a crafting DC by 6.

After three failures on the Intelligence check, the *Crafter�s Codex* moves on. You retain a copy of *Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things* but the magic and marginalia of the *Crafter�s Codex* magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it*.* Any bonuses accrued

remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first).

#### Seekers of the Codex

The *Crafter�s Codex* is coveted by collectors and ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the *Crafter�s Codex* surely means encountering some of the following foes.

**TABLE: SEEKERS OF THE CODEX**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **1D6 ADVERSARY** | |
| 1 | Noble with entourage of bodyguards�previous owner or antimagic zealot |
| 2 | Assassin, stealthy mage, or thief |
| 3 | Rival artificer (friendly or hostile) |
| 4 | Mischievous book-obsessed fey |
| 5 | Celestial or fiendish curator of an interplanar library |
| 6 | Rival artificer from an entirely different Material Plane |

#### Destruction

When the artifact faces a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the *Crafter�s Codex* is to eliminate every last copy of *Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things* that exists in the multiverse�if even one copy remains, even on another plane of existence, the *Crafter�s Codex* persists.

### Dread Caduceus

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

This heavy silver scepter has two heads, both cast in metal and staring out of glassy onyx eyes. One head is a skull, its jaw

thrown open and its teeth unnaturally elongated. At the other end of the scepter is a cherubic human face that is turned upwards as though determined not to look at

its sibling.

While you are attuned to the *Dread Caduceus* you may use either end of the scepter to activate its powers.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Dread Caduceus*, a holy scepter with the power to raise the dead.

**DC 18** The cherub and skull heads cause healing and necromantic effects, respectively.

**DC 21** Those who use the scepter risk having their very flesh corrupted and their souls devoured.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Dread Caduceus* has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.

The *Dread Caduceus* warps your life energy, twisting your flesh as it corrupts that of others. While you are attuned to the scepter, your organs shift and twist, sticking to one another within you. Take 1d6 necrotic damage each dawn from this effect. This damage can only be healed by a long or short rest. You also have disadvantage on initiative rolls as you are distracted by this tangible shifting within.

The *Dread Caduceus* has 2d10 charges and regains 1d10 charges each dawn.

When you reduce the *Dread Caduceus* to 0 charges, you take 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points,

you instantly die and cannot be resurrected (even by a *wish* spell).

#### Cherub

You can use an action and expend charges from the *Dread Caduceus* to cause one of the following effects to extend from the cherub head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 30 feet:

**Heal.** The creature regains 1d8+1 hit points for each expended charge.

**Healing Nimbus (3 Charges).** A nimbus of healing appears around the creature for 1d6 rounds. For the duration, whenever the creature takes damage from an attack it regains 1 hit point, and when an attack misses the creature it regains 1d4 hit points.

**Invulnerability (3 Charges).** The creature becomes immune to damage from nonmagical attacks for 1d4 rounds.

**Exhaustless (5 Charges).** The creature becomes immune to fatigue for 1d6 days.

**Resistance (5 Charges).** The creature becomes resistant to one type of damage of your choice for 1d6 rounds. This property has no effect if the creature already has resistance to that damage type.

**Cure (10 Charges).** The creature is healed of any curses, diseases, poisons, or other negative effects, even if a wish spell has previously been unsuccessful.

**Invigorate (10 Charges).** The creature permanently increases its maximum hit points by 1d8+1. A creature can only benefit from this property once.

#### Skull

You can use an action and expend charges from the *Dread Caduceus* to cause one of the following effects to extend from the skull

head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 100 feet:

**Animate Skeleton (1 Charge).** You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating the skeleton of its body to serve at your whim. The creature gains the skeleton template and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the Dread Caduceus.

**Animate Zombie (2 Charges).** You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating it as a zombie to serve at your whim. The creature gains the zombie template and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the *Dread Caduceus*.

**Empower Undead (2 Charges).** Choose 1d6 undead that you can see within range. Whenever one of the chosen undead makes a weapon attack it deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage.

Even on a miss, the undead deals 1d4 necrotic damage.

**Animate Legion (6 Charges).** You return 3d10 dead humanoids to a semblance of life, transforming their corpses into zombies.

You can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead you create using the *Dread Caduceus*. When you command multiple undead, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.

In addition, any creature you animate in this fashion retains injuries or disfigurements that were upon its corpse, and it continues to decompose.

#### Skeleton Template

A skeleton creature retains all its statistics except as noted below.

***Type.*** The skeleton�s type is undead. It does not require air, sleep, or sustenance.

***Actions.*** The zombie gains a Bite and Grab attack, both of which use Strength for attack and damage rolls. The escape DC for the zombie�s Grab is equal to its maneuver DC. It loses any ranged attacks that require the use of a weapon more complex than a rock.

### Memory Leaf

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

Precious beyond reckoning, this silver leaf has fallen from a Memory Tree and contains a psychic imprint of the living creature it was once connected to. It can only be attuned when pressed against the forehead and is often set into a woven headband.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Memory Leaf*, which fell from a Memory Tree in ages past.

**DC 18** Sometimes those who wear the leaf sense those who have worn it before.

**DC 21** The leaf can grant knowledge about the ancient world.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Memory Leaf* has one lesser artifact benefit. There is a 50% chance when you attune to the leaf that you discover a lesser artifact detriment.

In some cases the benefit and detriment are reflections of the former personality, and you may acquire those traits while attuned to it.

#### Magic

While this leaf is pressed against your forehead, you can cast *legend lore* to ask the psychic imprint within the leaf one question about the ancient world. Once you have used this property 3 times, it cannot be used again until next dawn.

#### Orb of Dragonkind

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

Long ago the souls of five evil dragons were ripped from their corporeal bodies and captured with arcana by mages that sought to end the tyranny of wicked winged serpents. Each is contained within an intricately inscribed crystal globe 10 inches across�though when the magic within is called upon, an orb swells to double its size and glows with a faint light revealing the color of the scales that once belonged to what little remains of the creature that now resides in it.

While you are attuned to and holding an *Orb of Dragonkind*, you can use an action and speak a command word to attempt to control the draconic soul within by making a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, you can control the *Orb of Dragonkind*, or on a failure you are charmed by it. Both effects last until you are no longer attuned to the orb.

While you are charmed by the orb, you cannot choose to end your attunement to it. In addition, the orb can innately cast *suggestion* on you at will (save DC 18) to compel you to commit evil acts that serve its purposes�exacting revenge, attaining its freedom, spread suffering and ruin, encourage the worship of foul draconic deities, collect the other *orbs of dragonkind*, or whatever else the Narrator deems fit.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is an *Orb of Dragonkind*, an artifact with the power to control dragons.

**DC 20** Five orbs were made, each containing the soul of an evil dragon.

**DC 25** The orb can summon evil dragons, but does not actually control them.

#### Artifact Properties

An *Orb of Dragonkind* has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.

#### Magic

While you are controlling an *Orb of Dragonkind*, you can use an action to cast *detect magic* at will. You can also expend 1 or more charges to cast *detect magic* (no charge), *daylight* (1 charge), *death ward* (2 charges), *cure wounds* (5th-level version, 3 charges), or *scrying* (save DC 18; 3 charges).

The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges each dawn.

#### Call Dragons

While you are controlling an *Orb of Dragonkind*, you can use an action to send a telepathic message in a 40-mile radius. Evil dragons that are mortal and in the area are compelled to take the quickest and most direct route to the orb, though they may not be friendly or pleased with being forced to answer the call. Once this property has been used, you cannot use it again for 1 hour.

#### Destroying an Orb

Despite its glass appearance, an *Orb of Dragonkind* is immune to most types of damage (including draconic breath weapons and natural attacks), but they can be destroyed by the *disintegrate* spell or a single strike from a weapon with a +3 magical bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Raiment of the Devouring King

*Wondrous items, artifacts (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

Since the destruction of Nyth�Zerogg, the Devouring King, pieces of this mind-bending entity have shown up throughout history, ultimately destroying their bearers and causing untold devastation. The destruction that they have wrought is insignificant compared to the danger that they pose however, as these artifacts hold the key to restoring the spore of Nyth�Zerogg so that he may consume all reality.

The *Raiment of the Devouring King* consists of three pieces: a cloak, a crown, and an orb. To attune to a piece, you must awaken it by pouring the blood of a recently sacrificed sapient creature onto it, allowing you to graft it to your body in a process that takes a minute, during which you are incapacitated by agony. Once attuned, pieces can only be removed if you are killed.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is part of the *Raiment of the Devouring King*, the remains of an ancient being who consumed worlds.

**DC 18** There are three surviving pieces of the raiment: a cloak, a crown, and an orb.

**DC 21** The cloak grants flight and teleportation, the crown transforms the wearer�s body, and the orb enhances their mind.

#### Artifact Properties

While you are attuned to any piece of the *Raiment of the Devouring King*, you are subject to Malignant Influence (see below) and gain the following benefits:

* You cease aging and become immune to poison and disease.
* You gain a pool of 8 charges that can be spent to fuel the *Raiment of the Devouring King*�s magical properties (save DC 19,

+11 to hit with spell attacks). You regain 1d4 + 1 charges each dusk.

#### A Complete Set

Because of their powerful desire to be together, no matter how many pieces of the *Raiment of the Devouring King* you wear they count as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement. For each additional piece of the *Raiment of the Devouring King* that you acquire, you gain the following benefits:

***Two Pieces.*** Your pool of charges increases to 12. You can use an action to regain 1 expended charge by messily devouring an incapacitated or unconscious creature within your reach, killing it in the process. Creatures slain in this manner can only be returned to life by means of a *wish* or *true resurrection*.

***Three Pieces.*** Your pool of charges increases to 16. When you take a short rest, you can extend tendrils into the ground and regain 1d4 + 1 charges by consuming natural energy within a 1-mile radius. All plant life in the area dies and beasts become poisoned while in the area. This property can only be used in an area once per decade, after which it cannot support life for the next 10 years.

You cannot be permanently killed unless each piece of the raiment is cut from your body in conjunction with a carefully worded *wish* spell. Instead, you return to life 1d3 days later.

#### Cloak of the Devouring King

This deep jade cloak resembles a large piece of torn wing membrane. When attuned, it grafts to your back, reweaving muscle and bone and turning into a single leathery wing that grants a portion of Nyth�zerogg�s vitality.

While attuned to the *Cloak of the Devouring King*, you gain the following benefits:

* Your Constitution score is increased to 20. This property has no effect if your Constitution is equal to or greater than 20.
* You gain a fly speed equal to your Speed.
* You regain 1d8 hit points at the beginning of each of your turns if you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, you regrow the missing part within 1d6 days.
* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: *longstrider* (1 charge), *misty step* (2 charges), *blink* (3 charges), *dimension door* (4 charges), *plane shift* (5 charges), or *teleport* (5 charges)

#### Crown of the Devouring King

The alabaster crown resembles a jagged piece of flat bone affixed to a crude iron band. When worn, it settles so that a single spoke of bone extends above the wearer�s eye. When you attune to the skull, it grafts

with your bone and grants a portion of Nyth�zerogg�s strength.

While attuned to the *Crown of the Devouring King,* you gain the following benefits:

* Your Strength score is increased to 20. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.
* Your body transforms, turning a rubbery gray green as chitinous bone plates emerge from your skin. This counts as a suit of *+1 leather* if you are proficient with light armor, a suit of *+1 breastplate* if you are proficient with medium armor, or a suit of

*+1 full plate* if you are proficient with heavy armor. This armor does not impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

* You can use an action to spend 1 charge to shape chitin and bone from your body into a *+1 weapon*. You may only have two such weapons in existence at a time. Any ammunition needed is created as the weapon is fired. You may spend 1 charge as part of an action to deliver touch spells through a weapon created in this manner by making a single weapon attack as a part of that action. A weapon created in this manner crumbles to dust a round after it leaves your person.
* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: *shield* (1 charge), *enlarge/reduce* (2 charges), *protection from energy* (self

only; 2 charges), *stoneskin* (self only; 3 charges).

#### Orb of the Devouring King

This crimson orb resembles a massive, calcified heart suspended on a crude chain. When the orb returns to life, hooked tendrils extend and burrow into your chest, lodging it there where it grants a portion of the god�s mind and knowledge.

While attuned to the *Orb of the Devouring King*, you gain the following benefits:

* Choose Intelligence or Charisma. The chosen ability score is increased to 20. This property has no effect if the chosen ability score is equal to or greater than 20.
* You gain a 1d10 expertise die on Intelligence checks.
* When you take a short rest, you can recover an expended spell slot of 6th-level or higher by spending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot recovered.
* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: *detect thoughts* (1 charge), *suggestion* (2 charges), *black tentacles* (3 charges), *telekinesis* (4 charges), *dominate monster* (5 charges).

#### Malignant Influence

Each piece of the *Raiment of the Devouring King* longs to be united with the others so that Nyth�Zerogg may live again. While attuned to a piece of the artifact, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw once per month or gain a level of Malignant Influence, which cannot be removed while

you are attuned to the *Raiment of the Devouring King*. With two pieces of the artifact attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per week, and when all three pieces of the artifact are attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per day.

***Level 1.*** You become obsessed with acquiring the other pieces of the *Raiment of the Devouring King* and devote all of the time and resources at your disposal to the task.

***Level 2.*** You become ravenous and must consume one living sapient being each day or gain a level of fatigue that persists until you consume such a creature.

***Level 3.*** You fall entirely under the sway of the *Raiment of the Devouring King*.

You gain the Chaotic and Evil alignment traits, and you will stop at nothing to see Nyth�Zerogg reborn. You become an NPC under the Narrator�s control.

#### Awakening Nyth�Zerogg

If all three pieces of the *Raiment of the Devouring King* graft to a single host and they acquire three levels of Malignant Influence, the host�s mind and soul are devoured as fuel for Nyth�zerogg�s reawakening. The exact consequences of such a reawakening are left to the Narrator but likely pose an extinction level threat to mortals and gods alike.

#### Destruction

Many attempts have been made to destroy pieces of the *Raiment of the Devouring King*, yet they always reform. Some believe that they can only be destroyed by plunging a creature with all three pieces of the artifact grafted to its body into the heart of a star or a true flame in the center of the Elemental Plane of Fire.

### Serveros War Engine

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

In size and shape this massive construct is not unlike a squat hill giant�if hill giants were made of metal, leather, wood, and glass. With all manner of wheels, gears, cables, and hinges, when worn its movements are surprisingly fluid, if somewhat loud and heavy.

The last of its kind, the *Serveros War Engine* was used by a forgotten empire�s soldiers in wars that spread far beyond their kingdom. It�s hard to imagine there may once have been entire armies outfitted with these magical constructs and engaged in battle against one another, and impossible to conceive of the untold destruction they wrought.

Mounting the war engine is a fairly straightforward matter. As you enter the construct, you can don a helm and belt, both connected to the war engine, which allow you to attune to and control the construct. The construct is not sentient and moves only when controlled in this way.

When controlling the construct, you form a psychic bond with it, seeing through its eyes, moving with its limbs, and experiencing pain through its body.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Serveros War Engine*, the last war machine of a forgotten empire.

**DC 18** The engine is piloted from inside, and only those with mental and physical fortitude can endure it. In addition to

offering great might, it can manifest arcane blades, cannons, and other effects.

**DC 21** Destroying the engine requires destroying the helm, which is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Serveros War Engine* has one lesser artifact benefit. Piloting the war engine can be quite taxing, both mentally and physically. You gain no benefits from a long or short rest while mounted in the war engine, and when you expend its last available charge you suffer both a level of fatigue and strife.

While you are attuned to, mounted inside, and controlling the *Serveros War Engine*, you gain the following benefits:

* Your AC becomes 18.
* Your Strength score becomes 21.
* You are Huge-sized.
* Your Speed becomes 40 feet.
* You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid being grappled or knocked prone.
* You sustain only 1 hit point of damage for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt to you.
* Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage.
* Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.
* You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
* You are vulnerable to psychic damage.

#### Charged Properties

The war engine has several built-in features, some of which are powered by stored electrical charges or life energy.

* A sword hilt is secured to the construct�s hip by an incredible magnetic force. As a bonus action you can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to draw the hilt and engage its plasma blade. ***Plasma Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two hands.
* An arcane cannon is housed in the construct�s left forearm. You can use an action or bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the arcane cannon.

***Arcane Cannon.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 120/300 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) radiant damage.

* You can use an action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the construct�s right gauntlet as a projectile.

***Gauntlet Grapple.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 60/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6

+ 5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is grappled. As a bonus action you can retract the hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target moves with the hand.

The *Serveros War Engine* begins with 1d20 charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check, 2d10 charges can be restored during a long rest.

#### Variations

The Narrator may apply one or more of the following variant options if desired.

**Airborne.** You can expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to unfold magical wings and gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute.

**Disrepair.** When first discovered, the *Serveros War Engine* may be completely depleted of stored charges and heavily damaged, or perhaps almost completely dismantled. With maintenance, care, and careful reconstruction using Engineering (or a *wish* spell), it can be restored to its full, terrible power.

**Glass Jaw.** When the *Serveros War Engine* takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, roll a d20. On a 1, the war engine�s head is knocked off, disabling the artifact until it is repaired with a DC 23 Intelligence (Engineering) check and 8 hours of work.

**Mortal Echoes.** The *Serveros War Engine�s* last pilot died while mounted within the war engine, and echoes of their psyche still linger within the construct.

When first attempting to attune to the artifact, you relive the final moments of the dead pilot and make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and gain a short-term mental stress effect.

**Nautical.** You gain a swim speed of 40 feet. In addition, you can use an action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to seal the cockpit and fill it with breathable air which lasts for 1 hour.

**Recon.** You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet and can either expend 1 charge

or take 5 (2d4) force damage to activate magical floating discs on the soles of the construct�s feet. The discs last for 1 hour during which time the construct does not cause you to have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and you leave no tracks on the ground.

**Serveros Slayer.** In lieu of the arcane cannon and detachable fist, the construct is equipped with a psyblade in each hand. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to deploy one or both psyblades.

***Psyblade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6+5) psychic damage.

**Specialized Weaponry.** Instead of a giant plasma sword, the *Serveros War Engine* has one of the following weapons. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to equip and activate the weapon.

***Discus Throwing Shield.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* reach 5 ft. or range 40/80 ft., one target, or if thrown two targets within 10 feet of each other. *Hit:* 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage.

In addition, while the shield is donned your AC increases by 2. ***Extendable Metal Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning, or 18 (3d8+5) bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands, and a Large or smaller target makes a DC 18 Strength saving throw or is knocked prone.

***Shocking Net.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 30/60 ft., all targets in a 15-foot square area. *Hit:* 9 (2d8) lightning damage and the target is grappled. At the start of your turn,

conscious creatures grappled by the net take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. This weapon cannot damage a creature with 0 hit points.

***Sonic War Hammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8+5) thunder damage, or 21 (3d10+5) thunder damage when wielded with two hands.

#### Destroying the War Engine

Of all its various parts and components the key to disabling and ultimately destroying the war engine is the helm. The rest of the massive construct might feasibly be replaced or reengineered by an ingenious mind. However with its complex structure, both magical and mechanical, replicating the controller headpiece requires arcane knowledge and technical documentation that disappeared with the war engine�s creators long ago.

The helm is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm. Bypassing its magical protections requires two steps: first, a *dispel magic* cast at 5th-level or higher is needed to make the invisible barrier around the war engine�s helm vulnerable for 6 seconds, followed by a *disintegrate* spell cast at 7th-level or higher to completely dissolve the barrier. Once the barrier is dissolved, for the next 24 hours the helm can be destroyed like any other item (AC 22, 100 hit points) before its magical protections regenerate and fully repair it.

### Sword of Three Traditions

*Weapon (varies), artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

The *Sword of Three Traditions* is a

jewel-pommeled blade with the power to transform into other weapons�each specially suited for one of the eleven martial traditions. Originally called the *Sword of All Traditions*, over time the gems in the pommel were lost and now only three remain. Should its lost gemstones be returned, the blade might be restored to its full spectrum of glory and power.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Sword of Three Traditions*, which grants mastery of the techniques of combat. Each of the three gemstones in its hilt represents a tradition of combat.

**DC 18** The sword can transform into other weapons based on the gemstones in its hilt.

**DC 21** Only a dragon of the same color can destroy the sword�s gemstones.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Sword of Three Traditions* has two lesser artifact benefits, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. For each of the first five magical gemstones restored to the sword, it gains 1 lesser artifact benefit. For each of the last three magical gemstones restored to it, the sword gains 1 greater artifact detriment and 1 greater artifact benefit.

The *Sword of Three Traditions* is a *+1 longsword*. Once you are attuned, you can

use an action to turn the sword into a different *+1 weapon*. In addition, when you use a combat maneuver, the sword automatically changes into the weapon associated with that tradition. To change into a given weapon, the gem associated with that tradition must be attached.

While holding the sword, when you use a combat maneuver of a tradition associated with an attached gem, its exertion cost is reduced by 1 (minimum 1 exertion).

**TABLE: SWORD OF THREE TRADITIONS**

#### Magical Gemstones

Each of the lost magical gemstones of the *Sword of Three Traditions* is a wondrous item and artifact that requires attunement. Once attuned to a magical gemstone, it bestows a minor artifact benefit. You can only attune to the magical gemstone if you know a combat maneuver from the tradition associated with it.

You can use an action to attach a magical gemstone to the sword. No matter how many magical gemstones are attached to the sword, it counts as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1D12** | **TRADITIO N** | **WEAPON** | **GEM** |
| 1 | Razor�s Edge | Longsword | Diamond |
| 2 | Adamant Mountain | Greatsword | Peridot |
| 3 | Rapid Current | Two shortswords | Sapphire |
| 4 | Biting Zephyr | Longbow and quiver with 10 arrows | Pearl |
| 5 | Mirror�s Glint | Saber and light shield | Opal |
| 6 | Mist and Shade | Dagger | Aquamarine |
| 7 | Sanguine Knot | Bastard sword | Garnet |
| 8 | Spirited Steed | Lance | Topaz |
| 9 | Tempered Iron | Morningstar | Amethyst |
| 10 | Tooth and Claw | Battleaxe | Ruby |
| 11 | Unending Wheel | Rapier | Emerald |
| 12 | Adventurer� s choice | � | � |

The sword normally comes affixed with its diamond, peridot, and sapphire (for the Adamant Mountain, Rapid Current, and Razor�s Edge traditions), but the Narrator may choose to have different magical gemstones attached to it or determine them randomly.

When the sword turns into more than one item, the +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls only apply to any weapons created (there are no bonuses bestowed to the ammunition or shield). The additional objects materialize either in the attuned creature�s off-hand or strapped to their back. Any such item created by the sword disappears after 1 minute if it is no longer on your person, or when the sword changes shape again.

The sword�s power increases when 7 gems are in its pommel (turning it into a *+2 weapon* that reduces exertion costs by 2) or when fully restored with all 11 magical gemstones (turning it into a *+3 weapon* that reduces exertion costs by 3).

#### Seekers of the Sword

The *Sword of Three Traditions* is sought after by power hungry and righteous warriors alike, and any search for the fabled blade is certain to cause conflict with some of the following foes.

**TABLE: SEEKERS OF THE SWORD**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **1D6** | **ADVERSARY** |
| 1 | Warrior on training pilgrimage |
| 2 | Despot with a band of raiders |
| 3 | Master martial artist who tests the worthy |
| 4 | Spellsword in search of secrets |
| 5 | Greedy assassin or thief |
| 6 | Servant of the god of war |

#### Destroying the Sword

The power which binds the *Sword of Three Traditions* is located in its magical gemstones. Each gemstone can be destroyed forever if it is removed from the pommel and fed to an adult or older true dragon of similar hue. Once each magical gemstone is destroyed, the blade crumbles into dust.

### The Song of Creation

*Wondrous item (prayer book), artifact (requires attunement by a divine spellcaster)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

This golden tome is a written record of the divine dance which brought the world into being.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Song of Creation*, a prayer book filled with the eternal melody which brought the world into being.

**DC 18** The tome can break the minds of those who read it, but it can also grant access to powerful miracles.

**DC 21** The tome is completely indestructible.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Song of Creation* has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.

#### Mystical Tome

This tome is written in a script that even the angels cannot decipher. While attuned to it, you can read it as though you are reading your first language. Reading the *Song of Creation* reveals beautiful poetry about nature, light, and life, but structurally they do not make sense when read start-to-end.

The poems cannot be perfectly translated, as each individual interprets the same poem differently. The pages cannot be counted, and various purported complete counts invariably disagree.

When you first attune to this tome and when you read it, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or else become stunned for 1 hour. If you succeed on this saving throw, you are not subject to it again for 1 week. If you consult this tome during a Wisdom or Intelligence check to recall lore, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll, and any natural d20 results of 2 through 9 count as a 10.

#### Magic

While you use this prayer book as a spell focus, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC, and you cast

the spell without the need for any other material components that cost 1,000 gold or less. In addition, you know the following spells: *astral projection, demiplane, gate, maze, true resurrection*.

#### Destroying the Song

The *Song of Creation* is made from a material that defies categorization, and it may well be indestructible. The best hope at banishing its power from the world is to return the tome directly into the hands of a god.

### Veil of Fate

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

The *Veil of Fate* is a diaphanous silver and gray cloth attached to a thin silvery band which is worn on the bearer�s head. When worn correctly, it falls to the floor around its bearer, covering them entirely in a faint silver shimmer. It is unknown whether or not this appearance is due purely to the physical nature of the veil or its powers taking the bearer slightly beyond the bounds of reality.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Veil of Fate*, which allows the wearer to see the very strands of destiny.

**DC 18** The veil grants glimpses into the future.

**DC 21** Many who have donned the veil are immediately struck by disturbingly accurate premonitions of the future.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Veil of Fate* has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment.

When you are wearing and attuned to the veil, creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you as the combination of your enhanced foresight and diaphanous appearance bamboozles your foes.

The glimpses of the future granted by the *Veil of Fate* are not always advantageous. You are always last in the initiative order as you are overwhelmed with insights into the events that are about to unfold, though you may choose to use your foretelling roll (see Control Fate below) for all of your initiative checks for the day.

In addition, you can impart some of the veil�s power by falling into a deep meditation for 8 hours. When your meditation is concluded, your touch bestows one of the benefits of the *Veil of Fate* onto an allied creature, and you suffer a level of fatigue from the effort.

#### Foretelling

At the Narrator�s discretion, when you first attune to the *Veil of Fate* you are granted a detailed premonition of future events, presenting the opportunity to intertwine those threads of fate with your own. You can perfectly recall the premonition for a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 day), after which the memory is gone as if you never experienced it.

Anything you write down or otherwise record about the premonition during this time is all that remains. Another creature may be given a different premonition or no premonition upon attuning to the veil. You can occasionally recall key details of the premonition at important crossroads in the

future before the depicted events occur, and otherwise receive guidance from the premonition long after you�ve forgotten it.

#### Choose Your Destiny

While attuned to the *Veil of Fate* you are keenly aware of your own destiny.

When you spend 8 hours meditating on your destiny and life�s purpose, you can see some of the steps you must take to change it. This meditation brings on a profound change, and when it is concluded you may choose a new Destiny.

#### Control Fate

When you finish a long rest, you are bolstered by a strange sense of how to get the most out of your interactions and endeavours, gaining inspiration.

In addition, after completing a long rest you roll a d20. This is your foretelling roll. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you may choose to replace the d20 roll with your foretelling roll. You may choose to use this property after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the roll�s effects occur. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.

#### Magic

You may cast *augury* at will while attuned to and wearing th*e Veil of Fate*.

Twice per long rest you can cast one of the following spells without consuming material components or expending a spell slot: *arcane eye, clairvoyance, commune, divination.*

Roll a d20 after each long rest. On an 18 or above, you gain the benefits of the *foresight* spell.

### Walking Chicken Hut

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

Rumored to appear in bogs and swamps where amidst the fog it is often mistaken for a gigantic predatory bird, this ramshackle hut has been known to convey many an influential spellcaster. Arcane societies tend to look down upon the people that deign to use this artifact and refuse to recognize it for what it truly is, perpetuating the belief that it is a cursed relic best left alone. Any knowledgeable scholar knows there is good reason for the practice�sometimes when left idle for too long without a master the hut walks of its own accord directly towards the nearest planar portal, and all those known to have claimed ownership have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

A simple bed and table permanently affixed to the floor in this shuttered wooden hut, and it is able to fit up to 12 Medium or smaller creatures inside. After taking a long rest inside of the hut, you make a DC 21 Perception check, seeing through the veil and revealing its true nature on a success�strange markings and other signs of witchcraft cover nearly every surface of the interior and it reeks of chicken effluent. Once the veil is seen through, there are 8 glowing runes on the table, each only

half-illuminated. When you pass your hand over a rune, the energies inside respond and you can fully illuminate it or remove its glow entirely. When certain runes are illuminated, enormous chicken legs beneath the hut rise it up off of the ground. The *Chicken Hut* is a Gargantuan object with an Armor Class of 21, a total of 320 hit points, Speed 50 ft. or swim 10 ft. (0 ft. if the legs

aren�t extended), and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.

The hut floats on water. While the hut�s door and window shutters are closed, the interior is airtight and watertight. The interior holds enough air for 60 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.

You can use an action to control the illumination of as many as two of the hut�s runes, and a bonus action to control a third. After each use, a rune goes back to its neutral position. Each rune, from left to right, functions as shown in the Walking Chicken Hut Runes table.

If you are not attuned to any magic items and spend a week inside of the *Walking Chicken Hut*, you can attune to it. The hut uses 2 of your attunement slots. Once attuned, as long as you can see it you can use your bonus action to manipulate as many as 3 of its runes.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the *Walking Chicken Hut*, home to many wielders of magic throughout the ages.

**DC 18** The hut is known to move and act of its own accord.

**DC 21** The hut can be controlled using the runes on the table within.

#### Artifact Properties

The *Walking Chicken Hut* has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.

### Whispering Stones

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

**Crafting Components:** Unique (uncraftable)

Just as a fortune teller�s scrying ball is crystal clear, *Whispering Stones* are orbs of inky blackness.They allow communication across long distances. However, these potent artifacts are imbued with material from the netherworld and only five are known to have been created.

Connected via the realm of the dead, with proper use a person can communicate simultaneously with any number of other *Whispering Stones* and *message stones*, or even stream thoughts from places and beings beyond death.

#### Legends and Lore

Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is a *Whispering Stone*, which allows communication across long distances. Only five of these stones were ever created.

**DC 18** The stones can speak to each other.

**DC 21** The stones can also speak to the dead, or ask questions of powerful extraplanar beings.

#### Artifact Properties

Each time you use a *Whispering Stone* to cast a spell, roll a d20. On a 1, the casting connects your mind with that of an extradimensional entity chosen by the Narrator. You begin to hear this entity�s thoughts in your head (and vice versa), and if you were not already attuned to the *Whispering Stone*, you immediately attune to it. In addition, you gain one short-term

mental stress effect that lasts for 1d6 days. The voice in your head remains for as long as the mental stress effect.

If you simultaneously connect to two or more extradimensional entities, you make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a

long-term mental stress effect.

#### Magic

While touching a *Whispering Stone* you can use an action to cast *sending*. The target is a creature that carries a *message stone* or *Whispering Stone* you have seen before. If no creature currently bears that stone, or if you have never seen a *message stone* or *Whispering Stone* before, your message is conveyed to another recipient. The Narrator

may select a specific creature to receive the message or consult the Whispering Stones Listener table. This recipient of your message learns your name, current location, and that you bear a *Whispering Stone*.

A *Whispering Stone* begins with 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges each dusk.

While attuned to the stone, you can use an action to cast *speak with dead* (1 charge) and *spirit guardians* (1 charge). If also connected to an extra dimensional entity, you can cast *divination* (once between long rests) to ask the entity a question.

## Crafting Magic Items

For those who have reached the height of mundane crafting there is the intricate practice of creating magical items. This can be done during downtime, like crafting mundane items, but is often a more finicky process. Magic items can be as unique as their crafters, ranging from potions to armor sets, and a particular magic item can look different every time someone new crafts it.

Unlike crafting mundane items, crafting magic items is rather hit or miss. Crafting a magic item is either successful or it is not.

**Player Level.** Common magic items are called such for a reason�just about anyone can create them. As the rarity of an item increases however, so does the level of skill required. The Minimum Player Level table shows what level a character must reach before being able to craft magic items of a certain rarity.

Unless their statistics state otherwise, an NPC is only able to craft magic items if they have spellcasting levels.

**Base Materials.** To craft a magic item a character must first acquire base materials equal to half the magic item�s cost; this includes special metals, wood,

leather, and other substances which make the basic item, plus a mixture of common alchemical reagents, arcane components, or divine ingredients. These materials can be purchased easily as long as the character has the requisite funds and usually do not need to be accounted for individually.

**Special Components.** For most magic items, specific additional components are also needed that may not be available for purchase. PCs may need to undertake adventures in order to acquire these components. See the description of the desired magic item to learn what, if any, special items are needed. Special components include exotic items (such as a mirror that a basilisk has seen its reflection in), or creature parts (such as dragon scales). Creature parts can be easily collected from a defeated monster with no special ability checks required; this takes one hour and gives one dose plus one dose per size category of the creature above Medium. Collecting creature parts from any unwilling sentient humanoid is considered an evil act.

Special components generally can�t be bought or sold (the market for them is just too niche), but Narrators may decide that instead of questing for the special components to create a magic item that they can be purchased for 25% of the magic item�s cost.

**Item Quality.** Common magic items can be made from items of any quality, but uncommon magic items require an item of fine quality, and rare or greater magic items require an item of masterwork quality. Costs for an item�s quality are included in a magic item�s base cost.

**Time Required*.*** The time required to craft a magic item depends on its rarity, as shown on the Magic Item Crafting

Time table. To craft a magic item, a character must make multiple ability checks due to the difficult nature of magic item crafting: an initial check and a final check.

**Initial Check.** At the beginning of the required time, the character makes an ability check against the DC for an item of that rarity. On a success, they can continue crafting the item as normal. On a failure, they have to start over. On a failure by 5 or more, crafting can continue but the final check�s DC increases by 2. Failing this check by 10 or more consumes half the required materials and is considered a failed attempt; however you gain one expertise die that you can use the next time you attempt to craft the same item, as long as it has been no longer than a month.

**Final Check.** At the end of the required crafting time, the character makes another ability check to complete their magic item against the DC for an item of that rarity. On a success, all the materials are consumed and they make the desired magic time. On a failure, the process consumes half of the required materials and the crafting fails. On a failure by 10 or more, all the materials are consumed and the crafting fails.

**Ability Checks.** Different types of items, and different rarities, require different ability checks to successfully craft. The Magic Item Crafting Abilities table shows what ability checks are required to craft items of that type. Some magic items may fit in multiple categories, such as an amulet crafted from wood or suits of armor that also allow a character to cast spells. In these cases, which type the item falls under is determined by the Narrator.

**Tool Requirements.** Crafting anything requires the right tools for the job�this is especially important when crafting magical items. Each type of magic item and the tools associated with those types are detailed on the General Magic Item Crafting table. A character does not require proficiency with the tools needed to make a magic item, only access to those tools.

At the Narrator�s discretion, enough time spent crafting a specific type of magic item may grant a character proficiency with the required tools. This should only be done after a character has successfully crafted multiple magic items, or after they have created an item of very rare rarity or higher.

### Creating New Magic Items

Each campaign is different�every magic item may not be the best fit for a game, or the Narrator may need something that no one has thought of yet. In these instances, use the rules below to guide the process of coming up with new magic items and the ways a character might craft them.

#### Determining Rarity

Determining the rarity of a new magic item is one of the most difficult parts. While there�s no set formula for determining rarity, refer to the following points when choosing the rarity of a new magic item;

* An item with one low power property that is consumed upon use is most likely common or uncommon, depending on the property. If the property recharges, it may still be common if the effect has little mechanical impact.
* An item with multiple low to

mid-level power properties, or a single lower power property which recharges, is likely uncommon or rare.

* If an item has multiple powerful properties that recharge, or one significantly powerful property that recharges, it is most likely rare or very rare.
* If the item is powerful enough to be game-changing, or is especially powerful and one of a kind, it is likely legendary or even an artifact.
* If the item grants a creature the ability to cast spells, or replicates the effects of a spell, what level is that spell? The

higher the spell level, the higher the item�s rarity.

* Finally, consider the item�s purpose. Items that are less about making whoever carries them more effective, and more about granting access to something important for roleplaying purposes�such as defenses against a harsh environment, a way to overcome multiple language barriers, or survive somewhere without air�may have their rarity reduced. Conversely, items that allow for an adventurer or their party to easily complete dangerous tasks (particularly those granting flight) may have a higher rarity than usual.

#### Determining Cost

In most cases when including a new magic item for crafting or purchase it will be necessary to set a price for it. The Magic Item Costs table contains guidelines for pricing new magic items. Rarity isn�t the only thing to consider, however�for example, a magic item that is consumed on use is almost always cheaper than one of the same rarity that recharges. The following list contains a few things that may help determine the price of a new item.

* Is it single use, multiple uses, or does it recharge indefinitely? Single use items should be cheaper than multiple use items, which are themselves typically cheaper than something that recharges regularly.
* How does it compare to other items of the same rarity? If another item is of a similar

power level, use that item�s cost as a starting point.

* + Does it have one property or multiple properties, and how many uses does each of the item�s properties have? Something with multiple rechargeable properties is going to be more expensive than one with multiple single use properties, or even one recharging property.
  + Does the item grant a creature the ability to cast spells, or replicate the effects of a spell? If so, what level is that spell? The higher the spell level, the higher the potential cost.

There will always be outliers. The Magic Item Costs table does not take these outliers into account, and instead provides both an average low cost and average high cost for magic items that only require the standard components to create.

#### Sample Magic Item Details

|  |
| --- |
| 10 **Legendary Crafter:** Spoken of in history, legend, and song, a nigh-mythical smith or crafter created this magic item. So skilled was this artisan that their creations were innately magical, requiring no ritual or enchantment to gain their power. This magic item is expertly made and bears the legendary personal sigil of its creator. |
| 11 **Offering:** One culture made this magic item as a gift to another. Choose two appropriate origins from these tables, one as the giver and one as the receiver�the magic item has traits of both. |
| 12�1 **Osseus:** This magic item is made of bone with  3 ragged edges and dangling strips of other materials but it is brutally functional. If a weapon, it grows warm whenever it delivers a critical hit. |
| 14 **Planar Battlefield:** The afterlives of several gods or pantheons are everlasting battlefields where souls are reborn every morning to fight again. This magic item is a creation from one of those planes, intended to equip its eternal warriors. It bears the symbols of that plane or the gods ruling there. |
| 15 **Planar Echo:** This is a �copy� of a mundane item from the Material Plane is native to the Bleak Gate, the Dreaming, or another dimension that echoes the real world. This copy is magical even though the original is not. Magic items native to the Bleak gate are dim, lighter than expected, and cold to the touch. Those native to the Dreaming resemble nature in strange ways and occasionally change shape or color. |
| 16 **Servant of Chaos:** This magic item is made of strange, unidentifiable materials. Its design is uneven, imbalanced, with excessive parts or flourishes that serve no obvious purpose. Creatures with the Lawful alignment trait find its presence repulsive. |
| 17 **Servant of Order:** Minimalist and straightforward, symmetrical and technically perfect, this magic item strikes a precise balance between form and function. Creatures with the Chaotic alignment trait find its presence repulsive. |
| 18 **Shapeshifter: T**his magic item appears to be an average example of its type. When wielded by a shapeshifter (such as a doppelganger) it |

**TABLE: MAGIC ITEM ORIGINS**

|  |
| --- |
| **1D2 ORIGIN**  **0** |
| 1�2 **Accidental:** This magic item was never deliberately enchanted, but acquired it by chance. |
| 3 **Ancestral Bloodline:** Crafted for a particular family, this magic item gained its enchantment from multiple generations of their belief and veneration. It bears a family crest, though it may not be immediately obvious. Members of the bloodline want it returned when they learn of it, and others might assume the bearer is related to the original family. |
| 4�5 **Aquatic:** Crafted by merfolk, tritons, or similar aquatic (but non-elemental) cultures, this magic item is made of coral, sea plants, and scales. Using it underwater does not impose disadvantage even if it normally would (such as attacking with certain weapons), nor does it count toward encumbrance for determining penalties to swimming. |
| 6 **Dawncraft:** This ancient magic item comes from the dawn of the most recent age, before humans, elves, and dwarves became�culturally, physically, even mentally�what they are today. It is crafted of bone, stone, or tanned animal pelt, and may be adorned with feathers or bones. |
| 7 **Divine Gift:** No mortal hands crafted this magic item. It was placed by the gods themselves, or agents thereof, for mortals to find. The magic item is impossibly perfect in all respects, and it counts as a holy symbol. |
| 8 **Futurecraft:** This item is from the future or a civilization far beyond the world on which it was found. Its magics might be activated by small buttons or switches, its lines are sleek, its metals and fabrics unidentifiable, and it may even consist of substances completely unknown to the campaign setting. |
| 9 **Incarnated Magic:** The magic item sprang forth whole, its physical and mystical properties already intact, from more powerful magic, such as a wish or a lucky draw from a *deck of many things*. It is remarkably plain, lacking any artistic flourish or individual touch. |

changes appearance to match whatever guise the wielder assumes. The magic item�s basic nature is not affected, only the specifics of its appearance.

|  |
| --- |
| **Devoted:** The magic item fights to remain attuned to you. It must be separated from you for twice as long (48 hours) to break the attunement. If a new creature attempts to  6 attune the item when a prior attunement is still in effect, it makes a DC 14 Charisma check at the end of its short rest. On a failure, the item fails to attune to the creature, remaining attuned to you. |
| **Enigmatic:** Neither examination over the course of a short rest, nor identify or similar  7 magics, reveal this magic item�s properties. You can learn the magic item�s properties only through attunement or trial and error. |
| **Fastidious:** You can use an action to magically clean yourself, your equipment, and the magic  8 item of dirt, grime, sweat, and so on. Once you have used this property, you must finish a long rest before it can be used again. |
| **Focused:** You gain an expertise die on  9 Constitution saving throws made to avoid losing concentration. |
| **Gloom-sight:** If you have darkvision, the effective distance of that darkvision increases  10 by 20 feet while you possess the magic item. It does not, however, grant darkvision to you if you do not have darkvision. |
| **Hardy:** If the magic item is in your possession  11 for the entire time, you gain an extra Hit Die when you finish a long rest. If not used, this  extra Hit Die disappears in 24 hours. |
| **Lodestar:** This magic item is linked to a specific location or object, determined by the  12 Narrator. You can use an action to determine the distance and direction to that place or  object. The magic item does not impart knowledge of what that item or place might be. |
| **Restful:** If the magic item is in your possession  13 for the entire time, you can finish a long rest in 6 hours instead of 8 hours. You can still only  gain the benefits of a long rest once per day. |
| **Rescuscitator:** The magic item has 1 charge it regains each dawn. If the magic item is in your  14 possession, when you make a death saving throw it expends its charge and you gain an expertise die on the save. |

1. **Titan:** Made either by the creations of the gods themselves for use by their servants, or by mortals who venerate them, this magic item bears icons of religious significance, forgotten history, and possibly of widespread destruction. It weighs 50% more than similar items. Whenever this magic item is used to deal damage to an inanimate object (either with a weapon attack or by casting a spell) it deals an extra 1d4 damage.
2. **Vestige:** Created by the fading remnants of a forgotten god, or by one of its few surviving adherents, this item feels almost insubstantial. It weighs half as much as similar items and often seems on the verge of fading away entirely. When in the area of *detect magic* or similar effects, there is a 10% chance that it appears to be nonmagical.

**TABLE: MAGIC ITEM PROPERTIES**

|  |
| --- |
| **1D2 PROPERTY**  **0** |
| **Artful:** While the magic item is on your person,  1 you gain proficiency with one tool chosen by the Narrator. |
| **Beckoner:** When you are separated from the magic item you instinctively know its direction  2 and roughly how far away it is. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours or until the magic item is  attuned to someone else, whichever comes first. |
| **Brave:** When you contemplate or undertake a  3 cowardly act�or choose to be modest when a more daring option is available�the magic  item enhances feelings of shame and guilt. |
| **Bulwark:** If the magic item is in your possession for the entire time, you gain 5  4 temporary hit points when you finish a long rest. These temporary hit points last up to 24 hours. |
| **Cowardly:** When you are presented with an  5 opportunity to act in a cowardly or  self-preserving manner, the magic item  heightens your urge to do so. |

|  |
| --- |
| **Schemer:** You can use an action and choose one creature you can hear and see. For the next minute or until you choose to end the  15 effect (no action required), anything you say can only be heard by the chosen creature. Once you have used this property, you must finish a long rest before it can be used again. |
| **Skillful:** You gain an expertise die on ability  16 checks using one specific skill chosen by the Narrator. |
| **Speedy:** You can use an action to increase your Speed by 5 feet for up to 1 minute. may gain a +5 to walking speed. This bonus lasts until the bearer deactivates it (no action  17 required). The item grants this bonus up to a maximum total duration of one minute per day, resetting at dawn. Once you have used this property, you must finish a long rest before it can be used again. |
| **Suppressible:** You can use an action to completely suppress the magic item�s enchantment for a specific amount of time (up to 24 hours). For the duration, the magic item appears to be and behaves like a nonmagical  18 item, it cannot be attuned to (though existing attunement does not end), and it does not register as magical to detect magic, identify, or any other spells, features, or traits that detect magic. The effect cannot be ended early and lasts until the end of the specified duration. |
| **Unwavering:** The magic item grants you an extra sliver of luck to slightly mitigate unfavorable conditions. When the magic item  19 is created, the Narrator chooses one of the following: ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws. When you have disadvantage on a roll of the chosen type, you gain an expertise die. |
| 20 **Dual-Featured:** Roll twice, rerolling any additional results of 20. |

**TABLE: MAGIC ITEM QUIRKS**

|  |
| --- |
| **Bearer�s Mark:** The magic item physically marks you for as long as it remains in your possession. This might take the form of a tattoo  2 or brand, an unnatural change in eye or hair color, a slight alteration in the shape of a facial  feature (such as your ears becoming pointed if the magic item is elven-made), and so on. This change is always minor, but noticeable. |
| **Bond:** The Narrator randomly selects one of your companions. While in possession of the  3 magic item, you make every effort to perform little favors and services for, and to protect, that individual. |
| **Devout:** You must recite a prayer to one or more of the gods (of your choice) before a long rest or else you gain no benefit from that rest.  4 You must have given up the magic item at least 24 hours prior before this requirement fades. In  addition, so long as you have made the prayer in the last 24 hours you gain an expertise die on Religion checks. |
| **Dreamer:** The magic item causes unnatural dreams. You might dream in a different  5 language, or in unidentifiable colors, or even using senses you don�t actually possess. This has no effect on the quality of the bearer�s rest. |
| **Empathic:** This magic item changes appearance to match your mood. Sadness might cause it to appear worn and to turn blue,  6 happiness might cause it to gleam brightly, anger might make it turn red and radiate heat,  and so on. These alterations are purely cosmetic and do not alter the magic item�s function in any way. |
| **Leech:** The magic item feeds off healing magics cast on you. When you benefit from any  7 spell or magical effect that causes you to regain hit points, you regain 1 fewer hit point than normal. |
| **Mirrored:** While the magic item is in your  8 possession, whichever of your hands is usually dominant changes�if you are right-handed you  become left-handed, and vice-versa. |
| **Odorous:** The magic item emits a constant odor determined by the Narrator. This might be  9 a pleasant floral scent, an animal musk, a miasma of rot, or the like. Depending on the  scent, insects or small animals might be attracted to or repelled by the magic item. |

**1D1 QUIRK**

**Aesthetic:** While in possession of this magic

item you become exceptionally fascinated by

1 sights of beauty and feel the urge to take every

opportunity to stop and appreciate them.

1. utter a profanity, fail to show proper respect to an important individual, or generally behave in a rude or indecorous manner.

1. hunger. While the magic item is in your possession, you consume twice as much
