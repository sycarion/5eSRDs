# Monsters A-Z

## Monster Entries

You can use the monster information in this book to inspire your game preparation or worldbuilding ahead of time. You can also use it on the fly. Just flip open the book: each monster entry contains everything you need to generate a unique encounter, with suggested encounter groups, treasure, monster behaviors, and even names.

A monster entry has the following parts: description, legends and lore, sample encounters, monster signs, monster behavior, optional monster-specific tables, optional sample names, and stat blocks.

Description

This is an essay describing the monster�s place in the world. It may contain ecological information and story hooks. Like every other part of a monster entry, this description is for inspiration only: you are free to use another setting�s lore or invent your own.

Legends and Lore

What does an adventurer know about a monster? The Legends and Lore section describes the information a character might recall about a monster with a successful skill check. The higher the check, the more in-world information�natural history, weaknesses, and so on�the character recalls.

Even if a character learns nothing else about a monster, a DC 10 check is usually sufficient to recognize it by sight. At the Narrator�s discretion, recognizing a monster might not require a roll (for common creatures) or might be difficult or impossible (for rare or unknown monsters).

Sample Encounters and Treasure

Most monster entries include sample encounters, usually featuring multiple variations and varying difficulty levels.

Similarly, we�ve included sample treasure hoards along with each sample encounter. These sample treasures are a convenience for when you don�t have the time to randomly generate or hand-curate a treasure hoard. *Don�t use a treasure more than once!* It will strain credibility if two aboleths both have the exact same treasure hoards with identical numbers of coins and identical *periapts of health*. The second time a party would earn the same treasure reward, instead hand-pick or randomly generate a treasure using the appropriate rules.

It�s important to note that *not every encounter comes with treasure*. In fact, most don�t. For most campaigns, **the party finds only one to three treasures over the course of one character level**. The other encounters come with nothing at all or with ordinary equipment and a handful of incidental coins. Don�t make the mistake of giving out the sample treasure for each encounter!

If a monster does possess treasure, particularly magical treasure, it may well use it. An intelligent creature with a magic weapon will use that magical weapon if it�s capable of doing so. A mage with a *spell scroll* may use the scroll, and a creature with a *potion of healing* may quaff it.

Magical treasure not only acts as a reward but poses an increased challenge.

Monster Signs

Often, an encounter occurs with no warning: a group of characters stumbles into a group of monsters. Sometimes, though, characters come upon a sign of impending danger.

Perhaps they see a footprint or hear an ominous, distant wail. Clues like this allow characters to make interesting exploration decisions and make the world feel lived-in.

As a rule of thumb, assume that half of all encounters are preceded by the discovery of a sign (or its potential discovery: some signs may be missed by those who don�t make a successful Perception or other skill check).

A group may try to identify a monster by the signs it leaves behind, for instance by examining a footprint. As a rule of thumb, doing so requires a Survival or Investigation check (minimum DC 15), with some monsters being impossible to identify.

Monster Behavior

One of the most important elements of any encounter is this: what are the monsters up to? A roll on the monster behavior tables determines whether a monster or group is hiding in ambush, looking for help, preoccupied with a prisoner, or any of thousands of other individual behaviors.

These randomized tables can be a great way to quickly get a story idea when you don�t have time to read a whole essay.

Nearly every monster comes with its own individualized tables, sometimes broken out by environment or monster number.

Sample Names

Coming up with a name on the fly can be a hit-or-miss affair. If you need a suitably resonant name for a dread knight, or if the party suddenly takes a liking to a random goblin, we�ve provided sample name lists for most intelligent monsters.

Monster-Specific Random Generators

Some monsters call out for unique random charts to give them variety and bring them to life. Whenever possible, we want to provide inspiring details to make your encounters vivid and memorable.

Stat Block

Besides descriptions, lore, and other world information, each entry contains stat blocks. A stat block describes a particular creature�s capabilities, attacks, combat spells, and other statistics needed to run it as either a social or combat encounter.

One monster entry may contain multiple stat blocks.

Challenge and XP

Each monster�s stat block includes its Challenge Rating (CR). This is an important number for determining whether a monster provides a suitable combat challenge for a group. The higher the Challenge Rating, the tougher the monster.

In general, a monster of a given Challenge Rating can challenge two to four characters of the same level. If a single monster�s Challenge Rating is more than 50 percent higher than the characters� level, it may be too powerful an adversary for them. Thus, no monster in this book has a CR higher than 30.

Each monster�s Challenge Rating is accompanied by a number of experience points (XP). Experience points are one way to reward players for completing an encounter. In some games, when characters have triumphed in a combat or noncombat encounter against a monster, they are awarded the listed experience points. If you are not using experience point-based leveling, you can ignore this number.

Legendary Monsters

Legendary monsters are powerful apex creatures. They often rule the lands around them for miles. A legendary monster is a formidable opponent that can successfully wage battle against an entire adventuring party.

A legendary monster has up to three legendary actions, which it can use when it�s not its turn. Many legendary monsters also have legendary resistances, which are

abilities that allow them to succeed at a saving throw that they would otherwise fail. Using Legendary Resistance often comes with a cost.

Legendary monsters are intended to be used as solo opponents or as powerful bosses surrounded by minions. Just like a normal monster, a legendary monster is an appropriate combat challenge for two to four characters with character levels that match its Challenge Rating. However, its additional actions and defenses provide a more interesting battle, suitable for the climax of a story.

Elite Monsters

An elite monster is a tough and dangerous example of its species or type. Often, an elite monster represents a specific, named individual.

An elite monster is only suitable for gaming groups that desire an unusually difficult combat challenge. Fighting an elite monster is as tough as fighting two ordinary monsters of its Challenge Rating.

An elite monster is a hard combat challenge for four characters with character levels that match its Challenge Rating.

For magical effects and spells that rely on a creature�s Challenge Rating, such as *true polymorph*, treat an elite monster as if its Challenge Rating was doubled.

A creature can be both elite and legendary. Such a monster gains the extra complexity of a legendary monster and the doubled combat power of an elite monster.

Size

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan, or Titanic. A Small or Medium monster is around the same size as most characters and takes up a 5 by 5 foot space in combat. A Tiny creature takes up a 2 �-foot-square space. A Large creature takes up a 10-foot-square space, and a Huge creature takes up a

15-foot-square space. A Gargantuan creature takes up a 20-foot-square space. A

Titanic creature takes up at least a

25-foot-square space but can be larger.

Type

A monster�s type describes its origin or nature. While a monster�s type has no effect on its own, other game elements may refer to it.

Some monsters have a second monster type. For instance, a faerie dragon is both a dragon and a fey creature. Its type is *dragon (fey)*. Any game rules which apply to dragons, or which apply to fey creatures, apply to it.

Other monsters have a categorization that isn�t a monster type but which may interact with other game rules. For instance, a werewolf is a humanoid that is also a shapechanger. Its type is *humanoid (shapechanger)*. Rules regarding humanoids and shapechangers apply to it.

The fourteen monster types are as follows:

**Aberrations** are unnatural beings that don�t belong to this plane of existence. Many aberrations are telepathic and use a mental power known as psionic power instead of magic. An aboleth is an aberration.

**Beasts** are natural animals whose existence and abilities are nonmagical. A bear and a tyrannosaurus rex are both beasts.

**Celestials** are creatures native to divine realms or heavens. Celestials have alignments, such as Lawful Good. Most celestials are good, although the servants of evil deities can be evil.

Angels are celestials.

**Constructs** are beings that were built or made. Some are mindless machines, while others have some form of intelligence. Guardians are constructs.

**Dragons** include red and gold dragons, which are huge reptilian fire-breathers that number among the world�s most dangerous monsters. This type includes white dragons, which breathe killing frost, as well as smaller reptilian creatures related to true dragons, such as pseudodragons.

**Elementals** are creatures from one of the Elemental Planes. The most basic of elementals are earth elementals, fire elementals, water elementals, and air elementals, each composed of magically animate earth, fire, and so on. The Elemental Planes are also home to genies, mephits, and other elemental creatures.

**Fey** are creatures that are native to Fairyland, also called the Dreaming. These creatures live in a verdant realm of heightened natural beauty and combine grace and danger. Sprites and pixies are fey.

**Fiends** are evil-aligned creatures from Hell, the Abyss, and other cursed realms. Most fiends are demons and devils, each of which have their own subtypes and hierarchies. Some fiends, such as hell hounds, are neither demons nor devils.

**Giants** look like immense humanoids, standing from 10 feet tall (like ogres) to 30 (like storm giants). Some giants, like trolls, have human-like shapes but monstrous features.

**Humanoids** include a number of different intelligent, language-using bipeds of Small or Medium size. Humans and elves are humanoids, and so are orcs and goblins. Humanoids may employ magic but are not fundamentally magical�a characteristic that distinguishes them from bipedal, language-using fey, fiends, and other monsters. Humanoids have no inherent alignment, meaning that no humanoid ancestry is naturally good or evil, lawful or chaotic.

**Monstrosities** are magical beings usually native to the Material Plane. Some monstrosities combine the features of beasts and humanoids, like centaurs.

Others have bizarre or unnatural appearances, like many-tentacled ropers. Monstrosities could only arise in a world suffused with magic.

**Oozes** are ambulatory, predatory amoeboid creatures that infest caverns and other dark places. A gelatinous cube is an ooze.

**Plant** creatures are magical fungoid or plant-like creatures. Ordinary plants, such as trees, are not plant creatures. A treant is an intelligent plant creature that resembles a tree.

**Undead** are supernatural creatures or spirits that are no longer alive but are still animate. Some have been reanimated by magic spells, such as skeletons. Others, like vampires, are the products of an evil ritual or curse.

Celestials, elementals, fiends, some fey, and creatures with the titan subtype are immortal, meaning they are living creatures that do not die of old age (though they may die by other means). Undead and most constructs are creatures that are not living. All other creatures are mortal.

Armor Class

A monster�s Armor Class (AC) includes the effects of its Dexterity bonus and armor, if any. Many monsters have natural armor, such as scaly or tough hides.

Hit Points

While characters who reach 0 hit points normally make death saves, monsters typically die at 0 hit points. At the Narrator�s discretion, a particularly important foe or beloved ally might gain the benefit of death saves, or it might be stabilized with a successful Medicine check.

A Narrator can vary a monster�s hit points. Listed after each monster�s hit point value is a die expression (for instance 3d8 + 3). The Narrator can roll this to obtain a number of hit points that may be lower or higher than average for the monster, or raise or lower a monster�s hit points within this range to represent a creature that is stronger or weaker than average.

Monsters are considered bloodied when they�re reduced to half their hit points or less. Being bloodied isn�t a condition and has no effects on its own, but other game elements may interact with it. For instance, some monsters have abilities they can only use while bloodied.

A monster�s usual bloodied value is listed next to its hit points. If a Narrator has varied a monster�s hit points to make it weaker or stronger, the monster�s bloodied value is half its new maximum hit points (rounded down).

Speed

A monster�s Speed represents its walking speed. On its turn, a monster can move a number of feet equal to its Speed.

Some creatures have additional movement modes:

**Burrow:** The creature can burrow this far on its turn through earth, ice, or sand, but not through rock unless otherwise noted.

**Climb:** The creature can climb this far on its turn and doesn�t need to spend extra movement to do so.

**Fly:** The creature can fly this far on its turn. A flying creature falls if it is knocked prone unless it has the ability to hover, noted as �fly (hover)�.

**Swim:** The creature can swim this far on its turn and doesn�t need to spend extra movement to do so.

Ability Scores

Monsters have the same six ability scores as adventurers (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). These ability scores, along with a monster�s proficiency bonus, determine its skills, saving throws, and attack bonuses, just as they do for characters.

Proficiency Bonus

A monster�s proficiency bonus is added to any ability check that uses a skill, attack roll, saving throw, and the like in which it is proficient. You can grant a new skill or saving throw proficiency to a monster by adding its proficiency bonus to the appropriate check or saving throw.

Armor, weapon, and tool proficiencies aren�t listed in a monster�s stat block. Assume that a monster is proficient with any

armor, weapon, or tool that it�s likely to have used before.

Maneuver DC

Maneuver DC is the difficulty class of martial tasks such as escaping a grapple. A monster�s Maneuver DC is 8 + proficiency bonus + the better of the monster�s Strength or Dexterity modifier.

Saving Throws

The Saving Throws entry gives bonuses for the saving throws in which a monster is proficient. If a particular saving throw isn�t listed, the monster makes an untrained saving throw (adding the appropriate ability modifier to their d20 roll).

A monster can voluntarily fail a saving throw. An object always fails a saving throw.

Some abilities deal damage and inflict an extra effect, like a condition, on a failed saving throw and deal half damage on a successful saving throw. Unless otherwise specified, a successful saving throw prevents the extra effect.

Skills

The Skills entry gives bonuses for the skills in which a monster is proficient. If a particular skill isn�t listed, the monster makes an ability check (adding the appropriate ability modified to their d20 roll). Skills frequently gain expertise dice (see below).

Expertise Dice

Some monsters have expertise dice listed next to skills, saving throws, or other rolls based on their ability scores. An expertise die is a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20, which is rolled and added to the d20 roll it modifies.

When an expertise die is applied to a passive score, such as passive Perception, the expertise die�s average value (rounded down) is added to the passive score. For instance, a creature gains a +2 bonus to its

passive Perception if it has a 1d4 expertise die in Perception checks.

Resistances, Immunities, and Vulnerabilities

A creature immune to a certain damage type takes no damage of that type when subjected to it. A creature that is resistant to a damage type takes half damage (rounded down). A creature vulnerable to a damage type takes double the damage it is subjected to.

Some creatures are resistant or immune to damage dealt by nonmagical weapons, weapons that are not silvered or magical, or other forms of weapons. This applies to any interaction between a character and a monster. However, when a monster is fighting a monster, a different rule applies: the attacks of any monster of Challenge Rating 5 or higher are considered to be magical for the purposes of overcoming the damage resistance or immunity of a different monster.

Senses

Every monster has its passive Perception listed under its senses. Some monsters may have one of the following other senses, each of which is modified by the maximum range, in feet, at which the sense operates.

**Blindsight:** Not everything relies on vision to sense the world. Within a certain radius, a creature with blindsight is not affected by darkness or other heavily or lightly obscured areas and can detect invisible creatures and objects. Creatures adapted to the darkness (like bats and moles) or creatures without eyes (like oozes) have blindsight. Blindsight counts as sight for the purposes of targeting spells and so on.

A naturally blind creature with blindsight is noted as being blind beyond the blindsight�s range. Naturally blind creatures are immune to visual illusions.

**Darkvision:** Darkvision allows a monster to see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Darkvision doesn�t allow a creature to see color.

**Tremorsense:** A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the vibrations of creatures and moving objects which are in contact with the same surface. It can�t detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Tremorsense doesn�t count as sight.

**Truesight:** A creature with truesight can see in dim light, darkness, and magical darkness as if it were bright light, see invisible creatures and objects, and detect visual illusions and automatically succeed on saving throws against them. Additionally, it can perceive a shapechanger�s true form and it can see into the Ethereal Plane.

Languages

A monster can speak the languages listed in this entry. Sometimes an entry notes that a monster can understand but not speak a language.

**Telepathy:** Some monsters have telepathy listed as a language. Telepathy allows a creature to magically communicate with a target creature within the specified range. The target doesn�t need to share a language to understand the telepathic creature, but must understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can�t initiate a telepathic conversation but can respond to a telepathic message.

A telepathic creature doesn�t need to see a creature to communicate with a target, as long as it is aware of the target and neither is incapacitated. A creature can�t maintain telepathic contact with several creatures simultaneously.

Traits

Many monsters have characteristics noted below their languages and above their actions. These are called traits. All of a monster�s traits should be read carefully when running a monster, since they might influence any facet of the monster�s

behavior, actions, and abilities in or out of combat.

Sometimes a single monster entry includes multiple monster stat blocks that share a trait. Instead of reprinting the trait inside each stat block, it�s listed towards the beginning of the entry, right after the monster�s description.

Common monster traits include the following:

**Spellcasting:** A creature with the Spellcasting trait casts spells in much the same way a character does. It has a spellcaster level, spell slots, and a list of known or prepared spells. A monster with this trait can cast a spell with a higher spell slot if it has one available. The Narrator can customize such a monster�s spell list, swapping any known or prepared spell for another of the same level and from the same spell list. When casting an attack cantrip, the monster uses its spellcaster level to determine the effect of the spell.

**Innate and Psionic Spellcasting:** A creature with the Innate Spellcasting trait can cast spells without using spell slots. Instead, it can cast the spells it knows a certain number of times per day. It can�t cast a spell it knows at a higher level, and it can�t usually swap its spells known for other spells. When casting an attack cantrip, the monster uses its Challenge Rating instead of spellcaster level to determine the effect of the spell.

Psionic spellcasting works much like innate spellcasting. Creatures with the Psionic Spellcasting trait typically don�t require components for spellcasting.

Actions

Monsters can take the following types of actions: action, bonus action, reaction, and legendary action.

Monsters follow the same rules as characters when they take actions, bonus actions, and reactions. They can use one of the options described in their stat block, or they can use the options available to characters.

If it makes sense to do so, a monster may take an action, a bonus action, or a legendary action outside of combat and when not in initiative order.

Nearly anything can trigger a reaction. However, most creatures� reactions are triggered by an attack or a spell targeted at that creature or on a creature next to it. This is intended to ease the difficulty of complex battles: you only need to check a monster�s reactions when attacking that creature or a close ally.

In the description of a reaction, the term �attacker� refers to the creature that triggered the reaction by casting a spell or making an attack.

Legendary actions are only available to legendary monsters. An effect, like incapacitation, which prevents a creature from taking an action also prevents it from taking a legendary action.

Some of a monster�s actions or abilities may be magical in nature. If an ability�s description notes that it is magical, then it may be subject to spells such as *antimagic field* and *dispel magic*. Unless an action or ability specifies that it is magical, it doesn�t interact with those spells.

Limited Use Actions

Some of a monster�s action options have limits on their use. This is noted in parentheses after the name of the action. A single action can have multiple limits. Limits include:

**X/Day:** A creature can use this option only the given number of times per day. A monster�s day ends when it finishes a long rest.

**Recharge:** After the monster uses this ability, it can�t use it again until the ability recharges. At the start of each of the monster�s turns, the monster can roll a d6. If the roll is within the range in the recharge notation, the ability is recharged and the monster can use it on that turn.

For instance, if a monster�s ability says �Recharge 4�6�, it recharges on a d6 roll of 4, 5, or 6. Taking a rest also recharges the ability.

**Recharges after a Short or Long Rest:** A creature can use this ability once and then must complete a short or long rest before doing so again.

**While Bloodied:** A creature can use this ability only while it is bloodied (while its current hit points are half or less than its total hit points). Similarly, there are abilities that can only be used while not bloodied.

Attacks

Many of a monster�s actions are attacks. An attack can be a melee spell attack, a ranged spell attack, a melee weapon attack, or a ranged weapon attack. A weapon may refer to a manufactured weapon, like a trident, or a natural weapon, like a claw.

An attack usually targets either one creature or one target (which can be either a creature or an object), though an attack might target multiple creatures and might include other requirements (like �one creature grappled by the monster�).

An attack�s damage is presented as both a fixed number and as a dice expression. You can use whichever you like: use the fixed number to speed play or roll dice to provide variety.

Some weapons deal different damage in different circumstances. For instance, a longsword is versatile and deals 1d8 damage one-handed or 1d10 damage two-handed. In some cases, both options

are noted in an attack description. In other cases, only the most typical option is noted. A monster is allowed to use its equipment in ways not listed in the attack entry: consult the description of a weapon to see all the options available.

Spells

Some monsters have the ability to cast spells just as characters can. Since it can be inconvenient to cross-reference spell descriptions during combat, a monster�s most useful combat spells are listed among its actions.

The spell�s description provides the spell�s level (or notes that it�s a cantrip). It also specifies any spell components necessary and whether or not the spell requires concentration. Consult the creature�s Spellcasting trait to determine how many times a spell can be cast per day.

A monster�s stat block doesn�t summarize every spell known by a creature�just the ones most likely to be used during combat. Furthermore, the spell summary doesn�t always describe every option available in a spell. Additionally, a spell description rarely notes the effects of casting a spell with a higher spell slot. If a monster needs access to these tactical choices, you can refer to the full description of the spell.

Targets

Some actions require a creature to target one or more other creatures.

A creature can target a creature it can�t see with an attack (but it generally attacks with disadvantage, as per the rules for unseen creatures). However, a creature can�t target a creature it can�t see (or perceive with a similar sense, like blindsight) with an non-attack action that requires the target to make a saving throw, unless the action specifically says it can.

Gaze

Some actions have the Gaze keyword. Gaze actions have the following rules:

* In order to take the action, the monster must be able to see the target.
* If the target can�t see the monster at the time of the action, it has no immediate effect. However, if the monster and the target can see each other at any time before the beginning of the monster�s next turn, and the monster is not incapacitated, the action occurs then.
* If the target is not surprised, it can choose to avert its eyes from the monster at the start of the target�s turn. This lasts until the start of the target�s next turn. While its eyes are averted, the creature can�t see the monster.

Combat Strategy

After each monster�s stat block is a section describing the monster�s strategy in combat. It describes the monster�s preferred tactics. Most combat strategy sections also outline situations in which a monster will flee or surrender.

Combat strategy sections are meant to inspire but not constrict the Narrator.

Different monsters may employ varying strategies based on circumstances and personality.

Variants and Templates

Many monsters are listed with variant versions. A variant adds or replaces some of the monster�s characteristics and frequently alters its Challenge Rating.

A variant might represent an exceptional member of a group. Other variants are

re-imaginings of the original monster. When a variant changes a monster�s Challenge Rating, the monster�s proficiency bonus is unchanged.

This book also includes several templates which can be applied to a wide variety of monsters.

## Designing Monsters

Use these guidelines to create an original monster to challenge your characters in combat. You can build a monster ahead of time or on the fly during a game session.

Step 1: The Monster�s Story

What does it look like? Is it intelligent? How does it react to strangers? In a movie, what would its attacks look like?

Step 2: Determine Challenge Rating

To decide what CR will best challenge the adventurers, decide on the difficulty of the matchup and use the encounter-building guidelines in Appendix D: Designing Combat Encounters or use one of these shortcuts:

For a single monster against the entire party: CR = total character level / 3

For one monster per character: CR = average character level / 3, rounding up

Step 3: Customize Capabilities

Grant the monster any languages, senses, skills, saving throw proficiencies, movement forms, and traits that you think it should possess. You can use existing traits and other statistics for inspiration.

Most traits don�t require a change to the monster�s game statistics. However, if your monster has healing, regeneration, or damage transference abilities, lower its hit points by between 20�30%.

Step 4: Customize Combat Statistics

Consult the **Statistics for Monsters by Challenge Rating** table and then modify the listed statistics as described below.

Armor Class

You can raise or lower the monster�s Armor Class by one or two points without altering it in any other way. If you change its AC by 3 or more points, you should reduce or raise its hit points or damage per round by 5% per point of AC you varied from the base AC.

Hit Points

You can raise or lower the monster�s hit points by 10% without altering it in any other

way. Beyond that, you should reduce or raise its AC by 1, or its damage per round by 5%, for every 5% of hit points you varied from the base hit points.

Ability Bonus and Attack Bonus

The Ability Bonus column represents the monster�s highest ability modifier, usually the one it uses for its main attacks. You can raise or lower this bonus by 1 or 2 from the suggested value in the table.

A monster�s Attack Bonus is usually its best Ability Bonus plus its proficiency bonus.

Attacks

Most low-level monsters (CR 1 and lower) make one attack on their turns, while higher-level monsters make more attacks per turn (either as part of a Multiattack or with a combination of bonus actions and reactions). Monsters that occur in greater numbers should have few attacks, while lone monsters can have more of greater complexity.

Damage Per Round

The Damage Per Round column represents how much average damage a monster would deal per round if all of its attacks hit and its foes failed their saving throws against it on all of its actions. Divide this total among all the monster�s actions, bonus actions, reactions, legendary actions, and damaging traits.

This number can be raised or lowered by 3 or 4 points without changing the monster�s CR. For a monster in your home game, it�s not always necessary to convert a damage total into a dice expression, but you could.

Conditional Damage

Some attacks deal extra damage in some circumstances: for instance, a creature may deal extra damage to a grappled target, and a successful sting attack may deal additional poison damage only if the target fails a saving throw. As a rough estimate,

assume that such attacks deal their extra damage half the time. Thus, each two points of conditional damage only counts for one point of damage against the Damage Per Round budget.

Some attacks deal ongoing damage that might last for any number of turns. Assume that ongoing damage occurs once and then ends.

Special Attacks

You can vary a monster�s attacks by giving them tricks like area effects, limited-use abilities, and attacks that inflict conditions.

Area Attacks

A hellhound�s breath, a cleric�s *blade barrier*, and a balor�s aura are area effects that can affect multiple opponents. If a monster can use an area attack every turn, reduce the damage it deals to about 70% compared to a normal attack.

Limited-Use Abilities

Abilities that can be used once per day or once per short rest, or have a recharge of 6 or 5�6, are limited- use abilities. They typically allow a monster to exceed its damage-per-round budget on one turn, making up for it by dealing less damage on other turns.

For every two points of damage that a limited- use ability exceeds the damage per turn budget, reduce the total damage dealt on other turns by one.

Inflicting Conditions

Many monsters have other tricks besides damage: they blind, grapple, knock their opponents prone, or deal other such dirty tricks.

**Minor conditions** primarily affect movement or ability checks. Grappled, prone, and rattled are minor conditions. Treat a push or pull like a minor condition. When budgeting damage, you don�t need to take minor conditions into account.

**Moderate conditions** often impose disadvantage on the target. Blinded, frightened, poisoned, restrained, and

slowed are moderate conditions. Treat a moderate condition as the equivalent of damage equal to the monster�s Challenge Rating, or double if it can affect multiple characters.

**Severe conditions** prevent a creature from taking the actions it wants to take. Charmed, confused, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, stunned, and unconscious are severe conditions. Treat a major condition as the equivalent of damage equal to double the monster�s Challenge Rating, or triple if it can affect multiple characters.

Difficulty Class

To calculate the DC for a specific monster�s ability, add 8 + the monster�s proficiency bonus + any one of the monster�s ability bonuses.

The **Statistics for Monsters by Challenge Rating** table contains columns for Easy DC and Hard DC. Use the numbers in these two columns to judge

whether the DC of your monster�s ability is too high or too low to properly challenge opponents, and whether you should consider modifying the monster�s ability score. If you�re creating a monster on the fly without figuring out all the details, just use the DCs in the table without bothering with the calculations.

The Easy DC column represents a saving throw DC that gives most characters a chance to succeed. Use this DC, or a DC within 1 or 2 points, for effects that inflict severe conditions or that inflict moderate conditions for more than a turn.

The Hard DC column represents a DC that many adventurers are likely to fail. Use this DC, or a DC within 1 or 2 points, if the effect deals damage, a minor condition, or a

short-term moderate condition.

**Saving Throws** Dex +5, Con +8, Int +9,

Wis +9

**Skills** Deception +8, History +9, Stealth +5 **Senses** blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 15

**Languages** Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.

**Amphibious.** The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The aboleth�s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components: **3/day each:** *detect thoughts* (range 120

ft.), *major image*, *project image* (range 1 mile)

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** When the aboleth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, one of its eyes flashes with green light and then turns dull black. Once all 3 of its eyes are black, it is blind beyond the range of its blindsight until it finishes a long rest.

###### ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The aboleth attacks three times with its tentacle.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The aboleth can choose instead to deal 0 damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it contracts a disease called the Sea Change. On a success, it is immune to this disease for 24 hours. While affected by this disease, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws. After 1 hour, the target grows gills, it can breathe water, its skin becomes slimy, and it begins to suffocate if it goes 12 hours without being immersed in water for at least 1 hour. This disease can be removed with a disease-removing spell cast with at least a 4th-level spell slot, and it ends 24 hours after the aboleth dies.

**Slimy Cloud (1/Day, While Bloodied).** While underwater, the aboleth exudes a cloud of inky slime in a 30-foot- radius sphere. Each non-aboleth creature in the area when the cloud appears makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 44 (8d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. The slime extends around corners, and the area is heavily obscured for 1 minute or until a strong current dissipates the cloud.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The aboleth can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Move.** The aboleth moves up to its swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Telepathic Summon.** One creature within 90 feet makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must use its reaction, if available, to move up to its Speed toward the aboleth by the most direct route that avoids hazards, not

avoiding opportunity attacks. This is a magical charm effect.

**Baleful Charm (Costs 2 Actions).** The aboleth targets one creature within 60 feet that has contracted Sea Change. The target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies. The target can repeat this saving throw every 24 hours and when it takes damage from the aboleth or the aboleth�s allies. While charmed in this way, the target can communicate telepathically with the aboleth over any distance and

it follows the aboleth�s orders.

**Soul Drain (Costs 2 Actions).** One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

#### Combat

The aboleth strikes as many enemies as possible with its tentacles in order to infect them with the Sea Change, and then uses Baleful Charm on the biggest threats. When hurt, it uses Slimy Cloud and escapes through a hidden exit. Its thralls sacrifice themselves to cover its retreat.

#### Aboleth Variant: Ancient Aboleth

The ancient aboleth is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 11 monsters (14,400 XP). It is Huge and has 342 (36d10 + 144; bloodied 171) hit points. The aboleth has the following additional legendary actions, which it can use only while bloodied:

**Elite Recovery.** The aboleth ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can use this action as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.

**Look Upon My Works (1/Day).** Each creature within 90 feet makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature sees a fragmentary vision of the aboleth�s memories, taking 33 (6d10) psychic damage. After taking the damage, the creature forgets the vision, but it may learn one piece of lore.

**Lunging Attack.** The aboleth moves up to its swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks and makes a tentacle attack.

###### ACTIONS

**Poison Ink Knife.** Melee Weapon Attack:

+4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

###### REACTIONS

**Self-Sacrifice.** When a creature within 5 feet of the thrall that the thrall can see hits an aboleth with an attack, the thrall can make itself the target of the attack instead.

#### Combat

When protecting their master, thralls move into melee range with the most dangerous opponents, sacrificing themselves for the aboleth. They fight to the death.

## Angels

Angels are the immortal servants of the gods and the extensions of divine power.

**Aligned.** An angel radiates a Lawful aura. Most angels also radiate a Good aura, and a few radiate Evil.

**Celestial Dissolution.** When an angel dies, its body and equipment dissolve into motes of light.

**Detect Alignment.** An angel knows the alignment, if any, of each creature within 30 feet that it can see.

***Divine Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (5d8) radiant damage.

***Radiant Energy (1/Day).*** The deva touches a creature other than itself. If the target is unwilling, the deva makes an attack roll with a +8 bonus. The deva can choose to magically heal 60 hit points of damage and end any blindness, curse, deafness, disease, or poison on the

target. Alternatively, the deva can choose to deal 60 radiant damage to the target. ***Change Form.*** The deva magically transforms into a beast or humanoid or back into its true form. It retains its deva statistics, including speech and telepathy, except that it has the size, movement modes, and traits of its new form.

#### Combat

Against an isolated foe, the deva flies by the target, using Celestial Hammer and escaping out of range. Against a foe with an inferior ranged attack, it uses Divine Blast from a distance. In other circumstances, it closes to melee range and uses Radiant Energy and Celestial Hammer. Angels have no fear and rarely retreat.

#### Angel Variant: Fallen Angel

A fallen angel gains the following vulnerability:

***Damage Vulnerabilities:*** radiant

Evil fallen angels gain the following action: ***Consume Life Energy (1/Day).*** The angel feasts on the departing life energy of a humanoid within 5 feet. The target must have been slain within the last hour. The angel magically gains temporary hit points equal to half the dead creature�s

maximum hit points. These hit points last until depleted. Only a spell cast with a 9th-level slot can raise the corpse from the dead.

holy sword.

***Holy Sword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d6

+ 9) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) radiant damage.

***Column of Flame.*** Flame erupts in a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point the solar can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in the area makes a DC 21 Dexterity saving

throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage and 21 (6d6) radiant damage of a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

**Surrender!** The creature drops anything it is holding.

#### Combat

Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success. If the ankheg is grappling a target, it instead bathes the target in acid, dealing 14 (4d6) acid damage with no saving throw only to that target.

#### Combat

The ankheg lurks 10 feet underground, waiting for its tremorsense to register movement. It bursts out, firing its acid spray and then grabbing and biting the largest target available. It flees if badly hurt, dragging away any creature it has grappled.

While cursed in this way, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against the banshee�s Baleful Wail.

***Baleful Wail.*** The banshee shrieks. All living creatures within 30 feet of it that can hear it make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 11

(2d6 + 4) psychic damage. If the creature is cursed by the banshee, it drops to 0 hit points instead.

###### REACTIONS

***Wounded Warning.*** When the banshee takes damage from a creature within 60 feet, it uses Presage Death on the attacker.

#### Combat

###### ACTIONS

***Stone Gaze (Gaze).*** The basilisk targets a creature within 60 feet. The target makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. A *lesser restoration* spell ends this effect. At the beginning of the basilisk�s next turn, if still restrained, the target repeats the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the target is petrified. This petrification can be removed with *greater restoration* or similar magic or with basilisk venom.

***Venomous Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*

+4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

***Multiattack.*** The behir makes a bite attack and then a constrict attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature grappled by the behir, and the behir has not swallowed anyone else, the target is swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover from attacks from outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir�s turns.

If a swallowed creature deals 30 or more damage to the behir in a single turn, or if the behir dies, the behir vomits up the creature.

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5�6).*** The behir breathes a line of lightning 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. Creatures in the area make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

###### REACTIONS

***Vengeful Breath (1/Day, While Bloodied).*** When struck by a melee attack, the behir immediately recharges and uses Lightning Breath, including the attacker in the area of effect.

#### Combat

The behir prefers to attack with surprise, often from the ceiling. It opens with a lightning bolt and then tries to bite, constrict,

and swallow. It tries to escape when badly hurt, and usually has a bolthole nearby.

###### ACTIONS

***Vaulting Leap.*** The boggard jumps up to its Speed horizontally and half its Speed vertically without provoking opportunity attacks. If it�s within 5 feet of a creature at the end of this movement, it may make a melee spear attack against that creature with advantage.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:*

+3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

#### Combat

The boggard uses Vaulting Leap to move around whenever it�s not sneaking, essentially doubling its movement speed. When attacking, it uses Vaulting Leap to close with its enemies and deliver a powerful spear attack. While next to a foe, it

uses its more accurate bite attack. Once a group of boggards have been reduced to half their number, they retreat, trusting in their stealth to escape.

#### Boggard Variant: Boggard Bravo

The boggard bravo is CR 1/2 (100 XP) and has 27 (6d8; bloodied 13) hit points. It can make the following attack as a bonus action:

***Incite Frenzy (1/Day).*** Each boggard and frog with a Bite attack within 60 feet may use its reaction to make a Bite attack.

##### Earthshaking Croak (1/Day). Each

non-frog and non-boggard creature within 30 feet makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage and falling prone on a failure, or taking half damage on a success.

***Summon Frog Guardians (1/Day).*** The boggard magically summons two Medium frog guardians, which wriggle from the ground in an empty space within 30 feet.

They follow the boggard�s orders and disappear after 1 minute. They have the statistics of boggards except they have Intelligence 2, have no spear attack, and can make a bite attack as part of their Vaulting Leap.

#### Combat

The boggard sovereign prefers to stay out of melee range, often leaping onto high and hard-to-reach places. It uses Earthshaking Croak, Incite Frenzy, and Summon Frog Guardians from a distance. If forced into melee, it attacks with its parting bite. If this attack hits, it hops away.

***Stealthy Sneak.*** The bugbear moves up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. It can then attempt to hide.

#### Combat

A bugbear prefers to strangle an unaware opponent from hiding. It fights with its maul if it must, but when badly injured it uses its Stealthy Sneak to reach a hiding spot and then either attack with its javelin or strangle a passing creature.

On a success, the creature takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet to a space

of its choice. If that space is occupied, the creature is knocked prone.

***Burrow.*** The bulette burrows under the ground without provoking opportunity attacks, moves up to its burrow speed, and then resurfaces in an unoccupied space. If it is within 5 feet of a creature, it then makes a bite attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.

###### REACTIONS

***Jaw Clamp (1/Day).*** When an attacker within 5 feet of the bulette misses it with a melee attack, the bulette makes a bite attack against the attacker. On a hit, the attacker is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the grappled creature is restrained, and the only attack the bulette can make is a bite against the grappled creature.

***Hard Carapace (1/Day).*** After taking damage from an attack, the bulette lies down and closes its eyes, protecting all vulnerable spots. Until the beginning of its next turn, its AC becomes 21 and it has advantage on saving throws.

#### Combat

The bulette targets halflings first. The bulette uses Leap if it can land on two or more creatures. Otherwise, it uses Burrow. It fights to the death.

## Cambion

A cambion is the offspring of a mortal and a powerful demon or devil. In its true form, a cambion has horns, batlike wings, and cloven hoofs that scorch the ground, but it often cloaks itself in mortal guise.

***Multiattack.*** The cambion makes two melee attacks or two ranged attacks. ***Black Iron Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*

+7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage, and the target takes a wound that deals 5 (1d10) ongoing slashing damage. A creature can end the ongoing damage by staunching the wound as an action or by giving the target magical healing.

***Fire Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) fire damage.

***Fiery Escape (1/Day).*** The cambion magically creates a fiery portal to the realm of its fiendish parent. The portal appears in an empty space within 5 feet. The portal lasts until the end of the cambion�s next turn or until it passes through the portal. No one but the cambion can pass through the portal; anyone else that enters its space takes 14 (4d6) fire damage.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Fell Charm.*** The cambion targets one creature within 30 feet. The target makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is magically charmed by the cambion for 1 day. The effect ends if the cambion or a cambion�s ally harms the target, or if the cambion commands it to take a suicidal action. While charmed, the target regards the cambion as a trusted friend and is an ally of the cambion. If the target makes a successful saving throw or the effect ends, the target is immune to this cambion�s Fell Charm for 24 hours.

***Command.*** The cambion gives an order to an ally within 60 feet that can hear it. If the ally has a reaction available, it can

use it to follow the cambion�s order, either taking an action or moving up to its Speed.

***Shapeshift.*** The cambion magically changes its form to that of any humanoid creature it has seen before, or back into its true form. While shapeshifted, its statistics are unchanged except that it has no armor or equipment, can�t use its black iron blade, and can fly only if it is in a form with wings. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

#### Combat

The cambion prefers to stay out of melee range, attacking with its fire blast and using Fell Charm on its first turn. It uses Command when it has an ally or charmed victim in position to harm one of its foes. If its allies fail it, it wades into battle using its black iron blade, attacking multiple targets to inflict ongoing wounds on as many foes as possible. When reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, it flies away, promising revenge. It uses Fiery Escape only as a last resort.

***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If this attack deals damage, the centaur�s movement doesn�t provoke opportunity attacks from the target for the rest of the centaur�s turn.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Deadeye Shot (1/Day).*** The centaur makes a shortbow attack with advantage.

#### Combat

Centaurs open combat by firing a Deadeye Shot. If their enemies have weak ranged options, the centaurs continue to use their shortbows from a distance. Otherwise, they gallop into battle, attack with their pikes and hooves, and gallop out again. They try to avoid ending their turn next to a foe. They retreat if half their number fall.

#### Variants: Horned Taurics

Tribes of elktaurs wander the tundra.

Goat-taurs skip nimbly over mountainsides. Elfin deertaurs race through faerie forests. These taurics bear horns or antlers on their heads and replace the pike action with the following:

***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 10 (2d6 + 3) damage if the centaur moved at least 30 feet towards the target before the attack.

## Chimera

***Reactive Heads.*** The chimera can take three reactions per round, but not more than one per turn.

***Three Heads.*** The chimera has advantage on Perception checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and it can�t be flanked.

***Wakeful.*** When one of the chimera�s heads is asleep, the others are awake.

###### ACTIONS

***Headbutt.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.

15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

###### REACTIONS

***Tail Swipe (1/Day).*** If a creature within 5 feet hits the chimera with a melee attack, the attacker is battered by the chimera�s tail. The attacker makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 9 (2d4

+ 4) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet from the chimera and knocked prone.

***Winged Charge (1/Day).*** If a creature the chimera can see hits it with a ranged attack, the chimera leaps off the ground and moves up to its fly speed towards the attacker. If within range, the chimera then

makes a headbutt attack against the attacker.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The chimera can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Bite.*** The chimera uses its Bite attack.

***Claw.*** The chimera uses its Claw attack.

#### Combat

The chimera uses its Breath Weapon when it can. It usually makes a headbutt attack on its turn, and it uses each of its legendary actions to claw a prone creature or bite anyone else. If a creature hits it with a particularly potent ranged attack, it uses its Winged Charge to try to punish that creature. It fights to the death.

#### Variants: Regional Chimeras

***Faerie chimera.*** White stag headbutt, black wolf bite, and silver dragon claw and breath weapon. This chimera�s breath weapon deals cold damage, and its form cannot be changed through polymorph or similar magic.

***Fiendish chimera.*** Bat wings and bite, hellhound breath weapon and claw, and nightmare trample which deals the same damage as the headbutt attack. This chimera is immune to fire damage.

***Sea chimera.*** Shark bite, lobster claw, and narwhal headbutt. The narwhal�s breath weapon is an ear-splitting cone of whalesong that deals thunder damage. This chimera has a swim speed of 60 instead of a fly speed.

***Sewer chimera.*** Alligator bite, giant rat claw, and horned snake headbutt. The horned snake exhales the breath weapon, a cone of gas that deals poison damage. This chimera is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and it has a swim speed of 60 instead of a fly speed.

***Tundra chimera.*** Polar bear bite, elk headbutt, and white dragon breath weapon.

This chimera is immune to cold damage and its breath weapon deals cold damage.

## Chuul

***Amphibious.*** The chuul can breathe air and water.

***Detect Magic.*** The chuul senses a magical aura around any visible creature or object within 120 feet that bears magic.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** If the chuul is grappling a creature, it uses its tentacle on that creature. It then makes two pincer attacks.

***Pincer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). When carrying a grappled creature, the chuul can move at full speed. A pincer that is being used to grapple a creature can be used only to attack that creature.

***Tentacle.*** A grappled creature makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the paralysis on a success.

#### Combat

The chuul seeks out magical treasure. It uses its Detect Magic ability to choose the target with the most visible magic items.

The chuul tries to grapple that creature and then paralyze it on the next turn. Once the chuul has at least one creature seized, it retreats, trying to carry its victim to its master.

#### Variants: Spell-Warped Chuul

A spell-warped chuul is CR 7 (2,900 XP), has 127 (15d10 + 45; bloodied 63) hit points, and possesses one of the following traits:

***Absorb Magic.*** The chuul has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Whenever the chuul successfully saves against a spell or magical effect, it magically gains 5 (1d10) temporary hit points. While these temporary hit points last, the chuul�s pincer attacks deal an additional 3 (1d6) force damage.

***King-Sized Claw.*** One of the chuul�s pincers deals 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. A creature grappled by this pincer makes ability checks to escape the grapple with disadvantage.

***Rune Drinker.*** Whenever the chuul takes damage from a magic weapon, until the start of the chuul�s next turn attacks made with that weapon have disadvantage, and the chuul gains a +4 bonus to AC. ***Sparking Wand.*** A *wand of lightning bolts* adorns the chuul�s carapace. A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity

saving throw or take 7 (2d6) lightning damage. As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the chuul can grab the wand by making a successful DC 14 Athletics or Sleight of Hand check. A creature that fails this check must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn�t knocked prone.

## Cloaker

Cloakers resemble flying stingrays with long, whip-like tails and sharp teeth.

**Languages** Deep Speech, Undercommon ***False Appearance.*** When motionless, the cloaker is indistinguishable from a black cloak or similar cloth

or leather article.

***Light Sensitivity.*** The cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks while in bright light.

###### ACTIONS

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target�s head, and the target is blinded and suffocating. Until this grapple ends, the cloaker automatically hits the grappled creature with this attack. When the cloaker is dealt damage while grappling, it takes half the damage (rounded down) and the other half is dealt to the grappled target. The cloaker can have only one creature grappled at once.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage, and the creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it

is poisoned until the end of the cloaker�s next turn.

***Moan.*** The cloaker emits a bone-chilling moan. Each non-aberration creature within 60 feet that can hear its moan makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened until the end of the cloaker�s next turn. When a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it becomes immune to the cloaker�s Moan for 24 hours.

***Phantasms (1/Day).*** The cloaker magically creates flickering illusions of itself in its space. Attacks on it have disadvantage. This effect ends after 1 minute, when the cloaker enters an area of bright light, or when it successfully grapples a creature.

###### REACTIONS

***Reactive Tail.*** When hit or missed with a melee attack, the cloaker makes a tail attack against the attacker.

***Angry Moan.*** When the cloaker takes damage, it uses Moan.

#### Combat

A cloaker never attacks unless it can do so with surprise. It either masquerades as a cloth item or uses Phantasms and lurks in the darkness or overhead. When it attacks, it bites. The first time it is attacked each turn, it uses Reactive Tail or Angry Moan. The cloaker flees if reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, if a creature escapes its grapple, or when in bright light. While fleeing, it uses its reactions to slow pursuit. A cloaker forced to flee often returns to stalk its foes, waiting for an opportune time to strike again.

#### Variant: Sand Ray

Cloaker statistics can be used for a sand ray, a levitating manta-ray-like creature that haunts deserts, or a shroud ray, an underwater form of intelligent manta ray that disguises itself as the ocean floor.

The shroud ray has a swim speed instead of a fly speed and can only breathe underwater. For either variant, the cloaker�s

False Appearance trait is replaced with the following:

***False Appearance.*** When motionless, the ray is indistinguishable from a patch of sand.

## Clockworks

Clockworks are constructs of steel and bronze that perform complex routines.

***Clockwork Nature.*** A clockwork doesn�t require air, nourishment, or rest, and is immune to disease.

***Immutable Form.*** The clockwork is immune to any effect that would alter its form.

###### ACTIONS

***Crush.*** The crusher moves up to its Speed in a straight line. While doing so, it can attempt to enter Large or smaller creatures� spaces. Whenever the crusher attempts to enter a creature�s space, the creature makes a DC 17 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the creature�s choice). If the creature succeeds at a Strength saving throw, the crusher�s movement ends for the turn. If the creature succeeds at a Dexterity saving throw, the creature may use its reaction, if available, to move up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

The first time on the crusher�s turn that it enters a creature�s space, the creature is knocked prone and takes 50 (10d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. A creature is prone while in the crusher�s space.

***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the crusher moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack, the attack deals an extra 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Overclock (Recharge 5�6).*** The crusher takes the Dash action.

#### Combat

The crusher moves straight towards the closest creature not authorized to be in its area, crushes it, and then moves towards the next creature, using Overclock if available. It repeats the process until no living unauthorized creatures remain. The

crusher uses its ram attack to knock down obstacles.

On a failure, the target is restrained as it begins to turn to stone. A *lesser restoration* spell ends this effect. If still restrained, the creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.

###### REACTIONS

***Frenzy (1/Day).*** When attacked by a creature it can see within 20 feet, the cockatrice moves up to half its Speed and makes a bite attack against that creature.

#### Combat

When angered, the cockatrice flaps at the nearest enemy and attacks. It attacks whoever damaged it most recently. It fights to the death.

#### Variant: Coralfish

The ornery and brightly-colored coralfish lives in coral reefs. It bites any creature that approaches it. Its statistics are identical to the cockatrice except its only movement

**Damage Resistances** psychic, radiant; damage from nonmagical weapons **Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 17

**Languages** all, telepathy 120 ft. ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The couatl�s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*

**3/day each:** *create food and water*, *detect thoughts*, *lesser restoration*

**1/day each:** *dream*, *greater restoration*, *scrying*

***Lawful Good.*** The couatl radiates a Lawful and Good aura.

***Nondetection.*** The couatl can�t be targeted or perceived by divination magic.

###### ACTIONS

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. *Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the couatl can�t

constrict other targets, and the couatl has advantage on attacks against the target. ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for 24 hours. The target is unconscious until the poisoned condition ends or a creature uses an action to shake the target awake.

***Heal (1/Day).*** The couatl touches a creature, magically healing 20 hit points of damage and ending the poisoned condition on that creature.

***Shapeshift.*** The couatl magically changes its form to resemble that of a humanoid or beast, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. If its form is humanoid, it is equipped with clothing and a weapon. While shapeshifted, its statistics are the same except that it can�t use Constrict and Shielding Wing and it may gain a swim speed of 60 or lose its fly speed if appropriate to its new form. If it�s a beast, it can use its bite attack. If it�s a humanoid, it may make a weapon attack, which functions identically to its bite attack.

###### REACTIONS

***Shielding Wing.*** When the couatl or a creature within 5 feet is attacked, the couatl can interpose a wing and impose disadvantage on the attack.

#### Combat

The couatl constricts its most dangerous or wicked foe and then bites it with advantage. It uses Shielding Wing to protect allies first, itself second. It retreats only if the stakes are minor.

###### REACTIONS

***Big Windup.*** When a creature hits the cyclops with a melee attack, the cyclops readies a powerful strike against its attacker. The cyclops has advantage on the next club attack it makes against the attacker before the end of its next turn.

#### Combat

The cyclops throws rocks when it can�t reach its foe but it prefers melee. It uses its club attack on whichever creature it has targeted with Big Windup. It may retreat or surrender if reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, unless it is too enraged to notice its wounds.

#### Variant: Cyclops Myrmidon

A cyclops myrmidon is CR 10 (5,900 XP). It wears splint armor (AC 17) and wields an

immense, long-handled maul. It has the following melee attack instead of a club. ***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit,

reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (6d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

#### Variant: Merclops

The merclops has a swim speed of 60 and breathes water. Instead of the cyclops�s rock attack, it has the following attack:

#### Languages �

***Echolocation.*** The darkmantle can�t use blindsight while deafened.

***False Appearance.*** While motionless, the darkmantle is indistinguishable from rock.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The darkmantle uses Darkness Aura and makes a crush attack. ***Darkness Aura.*** A 15-foot-radius area of magical darkness emanates from the darkmantle, spreading around corners

and moving with it. Darkvision and natural

light can�t penetrate it. If the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled. The darkness aura lasts for 10 minutes or until the darkmantle takes damage.

***Crush.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). If the darkmantle made the attack with advantage, it attaches to the target�s head, and the target is blinded and can�t breathe. While grappling, the darkmantle can only attack the grappled creature but has advantage on its attack roll. The darkmantle�s speed becomes 0, and it moves with its target.

#### Combat

The darkmantle lies in ambush on the ceiling, waiting until a creature comes within 10 feet. It then creates its Darkness Aura and flies to attack a victim. It flees if it fails to grapple a creature or if detached.

## Demilich

A demilich is what remains when a lich�s body and spirit have all but decomposed, leaving behind only a gem-encrusted skull and perhaps a few bone shards.

***Soul Vessel.*** The demilich preserves the soul vessel it used as a lich�usually a small item such as a box or amulet. If the demilich is destroyed while its soul vessel survives, the demilich reforms around the vessel in 1d10 days. A demilich can be permanently defeated only by destroying its soul vessel.

***Avoidance.*** If the demilich makes a saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, it takes no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

***Legendary Resistance (5/Day).*** If the demilich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, one of the five tiny warding gems set on its forehead or teeth shatters.

***Undead Nature.*** A demilich doesn�t require air, sustenance, or sleep.

###### ACTIONS

***Devour Soul.*** The demilich targets one creature within 120 feet, forcing it to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, or if all the large soul gems on the demilich�s skull are occupied, the creature takes 40 necrotic damage, and the demilich regains the same number of hit points. If the target fails its saving throw and there is at least one unoccupied soul gem on the demilich�s skull, the demilich regains 40 hit points, and the target dies instantly. Its soul is trapped in a soul gem on the demilich�s skull, visible as a tiny, creature-shaped mote of light. While its soul is trapped, a creature can�t be restored to life by any means. A soul that remains in a soul gem for 30 days is destroyed forever. If the demilich is defeated and a soul gem crushed, the creature is restored to life if its body is within 100 miles. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.

A demilich begins combat with one or two empty soul gems.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The demilich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. The demilich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Cranial Transposition.*** The dust surrounding the demilich falls to the ground. The demilich and a nonmagical, unattended skull within 30 feet teleport, switching places. Until the demilich moves or attacks, it is indistinguishable from a nonmagical skull, and the dust composing the demilich�s wraithlike body doesn�t reform around it.

***Dust Storm (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dust of the demilich�s body swirls in a 30-foot radius around the demilich. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. The demilich then moves up to its speed.

***Ringing Laugh (Costs 2 Actions).*** Each creature within 60 feet that can hear the demilich makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is frightened until the end of its next turn.

***Telekinesis.*** The demilich targets a Huge or smaller creature or an object weighing up to 1,000 pounds within 60 feet. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw. Otherwise, the demilich moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including up. If another creature or object stops the target�s movement, both take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. At the end of this movement, the target falls if it is still in the air, taking falling damage as normal.

#### Combat

The demilich stays immobile unless intruders take actions that threaten it or its treasure hoard. It then flies into the air, taking care to stay at least 50 feet above enemies. It uses Devour Soul on each of its

turns, targeting its biggest threat. It uses Telekinesis and Ringing Laugh when it�s able to do so from a distance. If creatures are within 30 feet of it, it uses Dust Storm and tries to move away. When reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, it uses Cranial Transposition to swap places with a decoy skull (if one is available) to give the impression that it has been defeated. It will not willingly leave its lair.

#### Variant: Demilich Mastermind

The demilich mastermind is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 18 monsters (40,000 XP). It has 319 (58d4 + 174;

bloodied 159) hit points. Its skull contains four soul gems instead of two, allowing it to trap up to four souls with its Devour Soul ability. The demilich mastermind has the following additional reactions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Reflection Arcane.*** When the demilich succeeds on a saving throw against a spell targeting it, it forces the spell to also target another creature within 30 feet.

***Skull Shock.*** When the demilich takes damage from a melee attack, the attacker takes 42 (12d6) lightning damage.

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the balor general fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it wards itself with its sword. The lightning that wreathes the sword winks out. The lightning reappears at the start of the balor�s next turn. Until then, the balor�s lightning sword deals no lightning damage, and the balor can�t use Avenging Bolt.

***Fast Reflexes.*** The balor general can take two reactions per round, but not more than one per turn.

The balor general has the following reactions instead of Instinctive Teleport: REACTIONS

***Avenging Sword.*** When damaged by a melee weapon attack, the balor attacks with its lightning sword.

100-foot-long, 5-foot-wide lightning bolt springs from the balor�s extended sword. Each creature in the area makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

***Darkness.*** Magical darkness spreads from a point within 30 feet, filling a

15-foot-radius sphere and spreading around corners. It remains for 1 minute, until the glabrezu dismisses it, or until the glabrezu uses this ability again. A creature with darkvision can�t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can�t illuminate it.

***Confusion (1/Day).*** The glabrezu targets up to three creatures within 90 feet. Each target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, becoming confused for 1 minute on a failure. A target repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

attack, it uses Teleport. If it teleports within 5 feet of a creature, it can attack

with its tail.

The marilith starts combat by engaging the strongest melee opponent, focusing its attacks against that enemy. It uses its tail to prevent its enemy from retreating. If troubled by ranged attacks, the marilith uses Reactive Teleport to move next to the ranged attacker and grapple them, so that it can attack the target with its longswords on its next turn. If reduced to 55 hit points or fewer, it uses Teleport to escape.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Horror Nimbus (1/Day).*** The nalfeshnee glows with an unholy, multicolored radiance. Each creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that can see it makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.

###### ACTIONS

***Claws (Bite While Shapeshifted).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned for 1 minute on a failure. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Scare (Quasit Form Only).*** A creature within 20 feet that can see the quasit makes a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature makes its saving throw or the condition ends for it, it is immune to any quasit�s Scare for the next 24 hours.

***Shapeshift.*** The quasit magically changes its form into a bat (speed 10 ft., fly 40 ft.), centipede (40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form except for its movement speeds.

Equipment it is carrying is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Invisibility.*** The quasit magically turns invisible, along with any equipment it carries. This invisibility ends if the quasit makes an attack, falls unconscious, or dismisses the effect.

#### Combat

The quasit turns invisible and assumes a highly mobile form (usually a bat). It then uses Scare or attacks with its claws or bite before turning invisible again as a bonus action. It then moves as far away from its enemies as it can. It might spend some

turns hiding without attacking at all. It changes targets and tactics frequently, since it can be killed easily if it becomes too predictable. If it takes damage, it hides invisibly until it recovers from its wounds.

#### Variant: Quasit Familiar

A familiar quasit gains the following trait.

***Familiar.*** The quasit can communicate telepathically with its master while they are within 1 mile of each other. When the quasit is within 10 feet of its master, its master shares its Magic Resistance trait.

***Light Sensitivity.*** While in bright light, the demon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.

###### ACTIONS

***Darken Light.*** The demon magically targets a nonmagical flame or an area of magical light created by a 2nd-level or lower spell slot within 60 feet. Any area of

bright light created by the light source instead casts dim light for 10 minutes. ***Replace Shadow.*** The demon targets a humanoid within 5 feet that is in dim light and can�t see the demon. The target makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw***.*** On a success, the target is aware of the demon. On a failure, the target is

unaware of the demon, the target no longer casts a natural shadow, and the demon magically takes on the shape of the target�s shadow, appearing indistinguishable from a natural shadow except when it attacks. The demon shares the target�s space and moves with the target. When the demon is dealt damage while sharing the target�s space, it takes half the damage (rounded down) and the other half is dealt to the target.

The effect ends when the target drops to 0 hit points, the demon no longer shares the target�s space, the demon or target is affected by *dispel evil and good* or a similar effect, or the demon begins its turn in an area of sunlight.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d10 + 3) cold damage.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Shadow Sneak.*** The demon takes the Hide action even if obscured only by dim light or darkness.

#### Combat

The shadow demon uses Darken Light to create areas of dim light and Shadow Sneak to hide in plain sight. It then uses Replace Shadow. Once it has done so, it may use its claws immediately, or it may travel with its victim for some time before it attacks. If it�s unable to use Replace Shadow, it tries to attack from hiding. It flees if dealt radiant damage.

***Spores (1/Day).*** A 15-foot-radius cloud of spores emanates from the vrock, spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, becoming poisoned for 1 minute on a failure. While poisoned in this way, the target takes 5 (1d10) ongoing poison damage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** The vrock screeches. Each non-demon creature within 20 feet that can hear it makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is stunned until the end of the vrock�s next turn.

#### Combat

The vrock uses Stunning Screech early in the battle to ground flying enemies. It attacks a stunned enemy with its beak and

talons. It uses Spores when it is within range of three or more foes (ignoring devil foes, which are immune to its spores). The vrock retreats only if ordered to by a more powerful demon.

Bearded devils never flee while within sight of an ally; however, they may tactically retreat to defensible positions.

***Chain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16) and restrained. Until the grapple ends, this chain can only attack the grappled target.

to piercing, poison, psychic, and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack, the devil may command the chain to make one chain attack against a target within 15 feet of it. If the chain is reduced to 0 hit points, it can�t be reanimated.

###### REACTIONS

***Unnerving Mask.*** When damaged by a creature within 30 feet that can see the devil, the devil momentarily assumes the magical illusory form of one of the attacker�s enemies or loved ones, alive or dead.

On a failure, it takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn.The attacker is then immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

The chain devil prefers locations festooned with chains. On its first and second turns, it animates a chain near its enemies and then attacks. Though it can�t make more than four chain attacks at a time, it animates a new chain whenever it can, so as to have as many attack options as possible. The devil uses Unnerving Mask once against each attacker. The chain devil fights to the death. It may let defeated creatures escape for the joy of hunting them.

The entanglement also ends if the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to succeed on a DC 16 Athletics or Acrobatics check to remove the lasso.

The erinyes can�t make a lasso attack while a creature is entangled.

###### REACTIONS

***Parry.*** If the erinyes is wielding a longsword and can see its attacker, it adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it.

#### Combat

The erinyes attacks from the air, weakening its foes with volleys of arrows. Once its foe is poisoned, it attacks with its longsword. It uses its lasso if its quarry tries to flee. It may also use its lasso to entangle a melee combatant with no ranged attack, lifting the creature into the air to keep it away from the devil�s more vulnerable allies.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks with its fork and one with its tail. It can replace any melee attack with Hurl Flame. ***Fork.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire

damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or construct, it makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it receives an infernal wound and takes 11 (2d10) ongoing piercing damage. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the ongoing damage increases by 11 (2d10). A creature can spend an action to make a DC 12 Medicine check, ending the ongoing damage on a success. At least 1 hit point of magical healing also ends the ongoing damage.

***Hurl Flame.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is an unattended flammable object or a creature, it catches fire, taking 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage. A creature can use an action to extinguish this fire.

***Inferno (1/Day, While Bloodied).*** The devil waves its fork, igniting a trail of roaring flame. Any creature within 10 feet of the devil makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

###### REACTIONS

***Pin (1/Day).*** When a creature misses the devil with a melee attack, the devil makes a fork attack against that creature. On a hit, the target is impaled by the fork and grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the devil can�t make fork attacks or use Inferno, but the target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage plus 3

(1d6) fire damage at the beginning of each of its turns.

#### Combat

The horned devil prefers to fight in melee, especially against weak enemies. It goads a ranged creature into making a melee attack, pins it, and keeps it pinned while hurling flame at other opponents. If fighting a melee combatant, the devil tries to pin the creature while 10 feet away from it, so that the creature can�t counterattack. When bloodied, it releases a pinned opponent in order to use Inferno. The horned devil follows orders to the letter and rarely retreats, but it might agree to a ceasefire if its orders aren�t specific.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes one bite attack and one claws attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

***Spear.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, becoming slowed for 1 minute on a failure. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Ice Wall (1/Day).*** The devil magically creates a wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet. The wall is flat, 1 foot thick, and can be up to 50 feet long and 15 feet high. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed. Each 10-foot section has AC 12, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.

If the wall enters a creature�s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (creature�s choice). The creature then makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) cold damage on a successful save or half damage on a success.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

###### REACTIONS

***Freezing Blood (1/Day).*** When a creature within 60 feet that the devil can see hits it with a ranged attack or includes it in a spell�s area, the creature makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) cold damage and is slowed until the end of its next turn.

#### Combat

The ice devil prefers melee combat, dropping its ice wall on melee attackers in a way that blocks ranged attackers from participating in the battle. The ice devil uses its spear attack first to slow one or two opponents, and then attacks slowed

opponents with bite and claws. The ice devil rarely retreats from melee, though it may do so if threatened by ranged attackers it can�t counter.

***Shapeshift.*** The imp magically changes its form into a rat (speed 20 ft.), raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.) or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form except for its movement speeds. Equipment it carries is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Invisibility.*** The imp magically turns invisible, along with any equipment

carried. This invisibility ends if the imp makes an attack, falls unconscious, or dismisses the effect.

#### Combat

Whenever the imp attacks with its sting, it turns invisible immediately afterwards and then moves if it can. It might spend some turns hiding without attacking. It changes targets and tactics frequently, since it can be killed with a readied action or an area attack if it becomes too predictable. Once damaged, it hides invisibly. The imp sometimes uses its Ventriloquism ability to create confusion and miscommunication.

#### Imp Variant: Imp Familiar

A familiar imp gains the following additional trait:

***Familiar.*** The imp can communicate telepathically with its master while they are within 1 mile of each other. When the imp is within 10 feet of its master, its master shares its Magic Resistance trait.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The pit fiend attacks with its bite and mace.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can�t regain hit points and takes 21 (6d6) ongoing poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

***Mace.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it makes a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 15 feet away from the pit fiend and knocked prone.

***Circle of Fire (1/Day, While Bloodied).*** A 15-foot-tall, 1-foot-thick, 20-foot-diameter ring of fire appears around the pit fiend, with the pit fiend at the center. The fire is opaque to every creature except the pit fiend. When the ring of fire appears, each creature it intersects makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful one. A creature takes 22 (5d8) damage the first time each turn it enters the area or when it ends its turn there. The fire lasts 1 minute or until the pit fiend dismisses it, becomes incapacitated, or leaves its area.

***Fireball (3rd-Level; V, S).*** Fire streaks from the pit fiend to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius, spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

***Hold Monster (5th-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** A creature within 60 feet that the pit fiend can see makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 22). While the target is grappled, the pit fiend can�t use its claw against a different creature.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

#### Combat

The pit fiend prefers to bite opponents that haven�t yet been poisoned. If three or more enemies are gathered together, it may instead use Fireball.

For its bonus action, the pit fiend attacks with its tail unless it�s near a weak melee attacker, in which case it grapples with its claw.

When the pit fiend is bloodied, it flies to the nearest ranged attacker and uses Circle of Fire, which blocks line of sight for many enemies and prevents creatures from easily escaping it. While fighting in the circle, it uses its mace attack to push opponents through the flames, forcing them to take even more damage if they run back through the flames to reach the pit fiend.

#### Variant: Pit Fiend General

The pit fiend general is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 20 monsters (50,000 XP). It is Huge and has 600 (48d10 + 336; bloodied 300) hit points. It has the following additional traits:

***Elite Recovery.*** At the end of each of its turns while bloodied, the pit fiend ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can do so as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.

***Reactive.*** The pit fiend can take a reaction on each creature�s turn.

The pit fiend has the following reactions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Vengeful Strike.*** When the pit fiend is hit by a melee attack on any turn but its own, it makes a claw or tail attack against the attacker.

***Fireball.*** When the pit fiend is damaged by an area spell cast by a creature within 120 feet that it can see, it uses Fireball, centering the fireball on the caster of the triggering spell.

***Hold Monster.*** When the pit fiend is hit by a ranged attack it uses Hold Monster on the attacker.

***Steam Breath (Recharge 5�6).*** The dragon turtle exhales steam in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

While retracted; its Speed is 0; it can�t take reactions; it has advantage on saving throws; attacks against it have disadvantage; and it has resistance to all damage. The dragon turtle stays retracted until the beginning of its next turn.

#### Combat

The dragon turtle uses its ram attack against ships. When fighting creatures, it uses Steam Breath if available and its bite otherwise. It generally uses its tail only as a reaction, unless it wants to push a melee combatant before retreating. It uses

Lightning Storm when it can�t otherwise reach its enemies. It attacks with its claws every turn. Dragon turtles flee into deep water when bloodied; if pursued, they turn around once their Steam Breath recharges and fight to the death.

***Cursed Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and the target�s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Fire Blast (1/Day).*** A fiery mote streaks from the dread knight�s finger to a point within 120 feet and blossoms into a

20-foot-radius sphere of black fire that spreads around corners. Each creature within the area makes a DC 16 Dexterity

saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw or half damage on a success. This damage ignores fire resistance and treats immunity to fire damage as fire resistance.

***Ice Wall (1/Day).*** The dread knight magically creates a wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet. The wall is flat, 1 foot thick, and can be up to 50 feet long and 15 feet high. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed. Each

10-foot section has AC 12, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.

If the wall enters a creature�s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (creature�s choice). The creature then makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) cold damage on a successful save or half damage on a success.

***Soul Wrack (1/Day).*** The dread knight targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 70 (20d6) necrotic damage and falls prone on a failure and takes half damage on a success.

***Summon Fiendish Steed (1/Day).*** A fell nightmare or wyvern magically appears in an empty space within 5 feet. The steed follows the dread knight�s commands and acts on its turn.

***Break Magic.*** The dread knight ends all spell effects created by a 5th-level or lower spell slot on a creature, object, or point it can see within 30 feet.

***Cursed Greatsword.*** The dread knight makes a cursed greatsword attack.

#### Combat

The dread knight uses its bonus action to duel the strongest melee combatant with its cursed greatsword, while using Fire Blast, Soul Wrack, and Wall of Ice to eliminate or

cut off those who interfere. If it is bloodied and without allies, it uses Summon Fiendish Steed and tries to escape.

#### Variant: Dread Knight Champion

The dread knight champion is a CR 23 (50,000 XP) monster. It has 346 (33d8 + 198; bloodied 173) hit points and has the following additional trait:

***Legion.*** The dread knight�s sword is a *+3 greatsword* that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls when it attacks with its cursed greatsword. A humanoid killed by damage from this sword rises the next dusk as a zombie. While attuned to the sword, the dread knight can use a bonus action to command zombies created in this way.

The dread knight has the following reactions:

***Cold Sacrifice (1/Day).*** When the dread knight would fail a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. It then magically teleports to an unoccupied space within 30 feet, leaving behind an inanimate duplicate of itself made of snow.

***Deflect.*** When an attacker the dread knight can see would hit it with a ranged weapon attack or ranged spell attack, it adds 5 to its AC against the attack. If the attack misses, the dread knight can force the attacker to reroll the attack, targeting a creature of its choice within 30 feet.

***Riposte.*** When an attacker the dread knight can see would hit it with a melee attack, it adds 5 to its AC against the attack. If the attack misses, the dread knight can make a cursed greatsword attack against the attacker.

***Seal of Silence.*** When the dread knight succeeds on a saving throw against a spell cast by a creature it can see, the caster of the spell makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the caster is magically unable to speak or cast spells with a vocal component until the end of the caster�s next turn.

The shadow elf spellcaster drider has the following additional actions:

***Darkness (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** Magical darkness spreads from a point within 30 feet, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere and spreading around corners. It remains for 1 minute. A creature with darkvision can�t see through this darkness and nonmagical light can�t illuminate it.

***Web (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** Thick, sticky webs fill a 20-foot cube within 60 feet, lightly obscuring it and making it difficult terrain. The webs must either be anchored between two solid masses (such as walls) or layered 5 feet deep over a flat surface. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is restrained. A creature can escape by using an action to make a DC 14 Strength check. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed

to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 5 (2d4) fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. The webs remain for 1 minute.

***Entangling Plants.*** Plants magically erupt from the ground in a 20-foot radius around a point up to 120 feet from the dryad. Each creature of the dryad�s choice in the area makes a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature is restrained for 1 minute. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check, freeing itself or a creature within 5 feet on a success.

Additionally, the area is difficult terrain for 1 minute.

***Fey Charm (3/Day).*** The dryad targets a humanoid or beast within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.. On a failure, it is magically charmed.

While charmed in this way, the target regards the dryad as a trusted ally and is disposed to interpret the dryad�s requests and actions favorably. The creature can repeat this saving throw if the dryad or the dryad�s allies harm it, ending the effect on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours.

The naiad has a swim speed of 30. Instead of Tree Stride, the naiad has the following trait:

***Amphibious.*** The naiad can breathe air and water.

Instead of Club, the naiad has the following action:

## Dragons

Dragons are winged, scaled creatures that resemble immense reptiles.

#### Combat

While individual dragons have their own personalities and tactics, most rely heavily on their breath weapons. They use them

whenever they can, preferably from maximum distance and while flying above their enemies.

When fighting in the open, dragons often circle above their enemies as they wait for their breath weapons to recharge. They only close to melee if their enemies deal significant damage with ranged attacks, or if they can savage an enemy cut off from its allies. Once bloodied, dragons become more aggressive, attacking with bite and claws when their breath weapons aren�t available.

If a dragon is protecting its lair, it utilizes lair features, traps, allies, and architecture such as escape tunnels to keep up a

hit-and-run fight, reappearing only when it has a fully-recharged breath weapon. If the dragon is forced into melee combat, it uses its bite and claws against a single foe. If it has legendary actions like Roar and Wing Attack, it uses them to disperse its other enemies.

If reduced to less than one-fourth its hit points while fighting in the open, a dragon flies away. However, it fights to the death to defend its lair, unless it can regain the upper hand through tricks or bargains.

#### Dragon Variant: Dragon Lich

A dragon lich retains all the statistics of the original dragon except as noted below.

***Type.*** The dragon�s type is Undead (dragon).

***Breath Weapon.*** When the dragon uses a breath weapon that deals damage, half of its damage is the original damage type and half is necrotic damage.

***Expanded Spell List.*** The dragon can cast *animate dead* with no material components three times per day. An ancient or older dragon can cast *create undead* with no material components three times per day.

***Immunities.*** The dragon gains immunity to necrotic and poison damage. It can�t be charmed, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

The dragon lich�s Legendary Resistance trait is replaced with the following:

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it loses its Undead Telepathy trait until the end of its next turn. Until the end of its next turn, undead creatures under its control are incapacitated.

The dragon lich gains the following traits: ***Rejuvenation.*** If it has a soul vessel, a destroyed dragon lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points. The new body forms within 10 feet of the soul vessel.

***Turn Resistance.*** The dragon lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Nature.*** A dragon lich doesn�t require air, sustenance, or sleep.

***Undead Telepathy.*** The dragon lich can communicate telepathically with undead creatures within 120 feet.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage. Instead of dealing piercing damage, the dragon can grapple the target (escape DC 23), and a Huge or smaller creature grappled in this way is restrained. While grappling a creature, the

dragon can�t bite or use Acid Spit against another target.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.

***Acid Spit.*** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save also takes 11 (2d10) ongoing acid damage. A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.

***Acid Breath (Recharge 5�6).*** The dragon exhales sizzling acid in a 90-foot-long,

10-foot-wide line. Each creature in that area makes a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 85 (19d8) acid damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is blinded until the end of its next turn.

###### REACTIONS

***Tail Attack.*** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Darkness.*** The dragon creates a 40-foot-radius sphere of magical

darkness originating from a point it can see within 120 feet. Darkvision can�t penetrate this darkness. The darkness lasts for 1 minute or until the dragon uses this action again.

***Roar.*** Each creature of the dragon�s choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a

saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.

***Wing Attack.*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.

#### Ancient Black Dragon Variant: Black Great Wyrm

The dragon is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 23 monsters (100,000 XP). It has 735 (42d20 + 294; bloodied 367) hit points and the following trait:

***Concentrated Acid (1/Day).*** When the dragon is first bloodied, it immediately recharges its breath weapon, if it�s not already available. For the next minute, the dragon�s acid becomes immensely more corrosive, ignoring acid resistance and treating acid immunity as acid resistance.

The dragon has the following additional legendary actions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Elite Recovery.*** The dragon ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can do so as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated. ***Mortal Terror (Gaze).*** A creature within 120 feet makes a saving throw against Roar, even if it has already successfully saved within the past 24 hours.

***Caustic Surge (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon recharges its breath weapon. ***Concentrated Decay (Costs 3 Actions).*** The dragon spits a highly concentrated blast of acid at one creature it can see within 90 feet. That creature is affected as if caught in the dragon�s breath weapon, rolling to save as usual.

#### Variant: Black Dragon Spellcaster

A black dragon spellcaster�s spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. Each age category knows its own spells and those of younger age categories.

Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failure.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite attack, it can Spit Poison.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.

***Spit Poison.*** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also poisoned for 1 minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failure and ending the effect on a success.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5�6).*** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a

90-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 80 (23d6) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature with immunity to poison damage that fails the save takes no damage, but its poison immunity is reduced to resistance for the next hour.

***Honeyed Words.*** The dragon�s words sow doubt in the minds of those who hear them. One creature within 60 feet who can hear and understand the dragon makes a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature must use its reaction, if available, to make one attack against a creature of the dragon�s choice with whatever weapon it has to do so, moving up to its speed as part of the reaction if necessary. It need not use any special class features (such as Sneak Attack or Divine Smite) when making this

attack. If it can�t get in a position to attack the creature, it moves as far as it can toward the target before regaining its senses. A creature immune to being charmed is immune to this ability.

###### REACTIONS

***Tail Attack.*** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Honeyed Words.*** The dragon uses Honeyed Words.

***Roar.*** Each creature of the dragon�s choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.

***Wing Attack.*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.

#### Ancient Green Dragon Variant: Green Great Wyrm

The dragon is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 24 monsters (124,000 XP). It has 840 (48d20 + 336; bloodied 420) hit points and the following trait:

***Venomous Resurgence (1/Day).*** When the dragon is first bloodied, it immediately recharges its breath weapon, if it�s not already available. After doing so, it emanates a green gas that extends in a 15-foot radius around it. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a

creature with resistance to poison damage loses it, and a creature without resistance or immunity to poison damage becomes vulnerable to poison damage instead. Either effect lasts until the start of the creature�s next turn.

The dragon has the following additional legendary actions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Elite Recovery.*** The dragon ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can do so as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated. ***Mortal Terror (Gaze).*** A creature within 120 feet makes a saving throw against Roar, even if it has already successfully saved within the past 24 hours.

***Toxic Surge (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon recharges its breath weapon. ***Concentrated Blast (Costs 3 Actions).*** The dragon spits a congealed gob of venom at a creature it can see within 90 feet. The creature is affected as if caught in the dragon�s breath weapon, rolling to save as usual.

#### Variant: Green Dragon Spellcaster

A green dragon spellcaster�s spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. Each age category knows its own spells and those of younger age categories.

***Spit Ice.*** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5�6).*** The dragon exhales a 90-foot cone of frost. Each creature in the area makes a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 66 (19d6) cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage.

###### REACTIONS

***Tail Attack.*** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Roar.*** Each creature of the dragon�s choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.

***Wing Attack.*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.

***Raging Storm (1/Day, Bloodied Only).*** For 1 minute, gusts of sleet emanate from the dragon in a 40-foot-radius sphere, spreading around corners. The area is lightly obscured, the ground is difficult terrain, and nonmagical flames are extinguished. The first time a creature other than the dragon moves on its turn while in the area, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) cold damage and fall prone (or fall if it is flying).

***Heart of Winter.*** When the dragon is first bloodied, it immediately recharges its breath weapon, if it�s not already available. Additionally, the damage from the dragon�s Raging Storm is doubled.

The dragon has the following additional legendary actions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Elite Recovery.*** The dragon ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can do so as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated. ***Mortal Terror (Gaze).*** A creature within 120 feet makes a saving throw against Roar, even if it has already successfully saved within the past 24 hours.

***Gathering Storm (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon recharges its breath weapon.

25 percent chance of capsizing and creatures that impact a solid object take 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Sudden Maelstrom (While Bloodied, 1/Day).*** The dragon magically surrounds itself with a 60-foot-radius maelstrom of surging wind and rain for 1 minute.

Until the end of its next turn, it can�t use Foretell, Prognosticate, or Prophesy Doom, and it loses its Predictive Harmonics trait.

***Predictive Harmonics.*** The dragon is psionically aware of its own immediate future. The dragon cannot be surprised, and any time the dragon would make a roll with disadvantage, it makes that roll normally instead.

***Psionic Powers.*** The dragon�s psionic abilities are considered both magical and psionic.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite, it can use Psionic Wave.

***Psionic Wave.*** The dragon psionically emits a wave of crushing mental pressure.

###### REACTIONS

***Prophesy Doom (When Bloodied).*** When a language-using creature suffering ongoing psychic damage targets the dragon with an attack or spell, the dragon telepathically prophesies the attacker�s doom. The attacker makes a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target magically gains the doomed condition. It is aware that it will die due to some bizarre circumstance within 13 (2d12) hours. In addition to the normal means of removing the condition, this doom can be avoided by a spell that can predict the future, such as *augury*, *contact other plane*, or *foresight*. The dragon can end the effect as an action.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Foretell.*** The dragon psionically catches a glimpse of a fast-approaching moment and plans accordingly. The dragon rolls a d20 and records the number rolled. Until the end of the dragon�s next turn, the dragon can replace the result of any d20 rolled by it or a creature within 120 feet with the foretold number. Each foretold roll can be used only once.

***Psionic Wave (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon uses Psionic Wave.

***Shatter Mind (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target

takes 22 (4d10) ongoing psychic damage. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ongoing psychic damage on a success. A creature can also use an action to ground itself in reality, ending the ongoing damage.

While Tiny, the bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by the noble�s attacks is halved. Additionally, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and advantage on Dexterity checks.

three-quarters cover. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold, fire, lightning, or psychic damage (its choice). ***Evil Eye (Gaze).*** The noble targets one creature not under the effect of a faerie�s Evil Eye within 60 feet. The target makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the noble chooses one of the following effects to magically

impose on the target. Each effect lasts for 1 minute.

* The target falls asleep. This effect ends if the target takes damage or another creature uses an action to rouse it.
* The target is frightened. This effect ends if the target is ever 60 feet or more from the noble.

#### Combat

The noble closes to fight in melee if possible. While doing so, it uses Vengeful Eye as its reaction to put isolated ranged attackers to sleep. If it feels outmatched by a strong melee opponent, it uses its reaction to make a glittering scimitar attack and then uses Faerie Step to move away on its turn. It flees when reduced to 55 hit points or fewer. Once out of sight, it casts *disguise self*.

#### Variant: Archfey

***Expanded Spell List.*** The archfey can cast *wish* with no material components three times per year. It can cast *weird* once per day.

***Weird (9th-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** The archfey terrifies creatures with their own worst nightmares. Each creature within 30 feet of a point within 120 feet makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature�s turns, the creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and then repeats

the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Fey Glamour.*** The knight targets one humanoid within 30 feet. The target makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On

a failure, it is magically charmed by the knight for 1 day. If the knight or one of the knight�s allies harms the target, the target repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target�s saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this knight�s Fey Glamour for a year and a day.

###### REACTIONS

***Nature�s Shield.*** When the knight would be hit by an attack while the knight is within 5 feet of a tree or other large plant, the knight�s AC magically increases by 3 against that attack as the plant interposes branches or vines between the knight and the attacker.

#### Combat

If possible, the knight fights within the shielding reach of trees, and it ambushes opponents when it can. If its opponents can�t fly, it flies at its maximum elevation of 10 feet, just out of reach of Medium creatures without ranged or reach weapons.

***Thorn Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 10/30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.

***Faerie Blessing (3/Day).*** The pixie targets a willing creature within 30 feet. The

* The target gains the benefit of the pixie�s Magic Resistance trait.
* The target speaks Sylvan.

***Faerie Curse.*** The pixie targets a creature within 30 feet not already under a Faerie Curse. The target makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is subjected to a special magical curse for 1 hour. The curse ends if the pixie dies or is incapacitated, the pixie or one of its allies deals damage to the target, or the pixie spends an action to end the curse. Spells such as *remove curse*, *dispel magic*, and *lesser restoration* also end the curse. If a creature makes its saving throw or the condition ends for it, it is immune to any Faerie Curse for the next 24 hours.

When the target fails its saving throw against this effect, the pixie chooses one of the following effects to impose on the target.

* The target is blinded.
* The target is charmed by the pixie.
* If the target is already charmed by the pixie, the target falls asleep. It wakes if it is shaken awake as an action or if it takes damage.
* The target�s head takes on the appearance of a beast�s head (donkey, wolf, etc). The target�s statistics don�t change, but the target can no longer speak; it can only make animal noises.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Invisibility.*** The pixie and any equipment it wears or carries magically turns invisible until the pixie attacks, casts a spell, becomes incapacitated, or uses a bonus action to become visible.

#### Combat

The pixie uses Faerie Curse on its foe and then turns invisible and flies to a new location. The pixie prefers to charm its enemies, although the beast�s head curse is useful to silence spellcasters. The pixie uses its thorn dagger on creatures immune to its curse. When encountered in a group, pixies usually flee as soon as one of their number is killed.

dispersed. Using Gust does not cause the sprite to become visible.

***Aligned.*** The forgotten god radiates a weak alignment aura, most often Lawful and Good, Chaotic and Good, Lawful and Evil, or Chaotic and Evil. Its behavior may not match its alignment.

***Flawed Spellcasting.*** The god�s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (save DC 17).The god can try to cast *flame strike* or *spirit guardians* at will with no material component. When the god tries to cast the spell, roll 1d6. On a 1, 2, or 3 on the die, the spell visibly fails and has no effect. The god�s action for the turn is not wasted, but it can�t be used to cast a spell.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** When the god fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it seems to flicker and shrink, as if it is using up its essence.

###### ACTIONS

***Divine Weapon.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*

+9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) damage (damage type based on the form of the weapon or implement) plus 7 (2d6) radiant damage.

***Stunning Gaze (Gaze).*** The god targets a creature within 60 feet. The target makes a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target is immune to Stunning Gaze for 24 hours.

##### Divine Wrath (1/Day, While Bloodied).

Each creature of the god�s choice within

60 feet makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) radiant damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

***Spirit Guardians (3rd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** Spirits of former divine servants surround the god in a 10-foot radius for 10 minutes. The god can choose creatures they can see to be unaffected by the spell. Other creatures treat the area as difficult terrain, and when a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a DC DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) radiant damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

##### Flame Strike (5th-Level; V, S). A

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The god can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Smite.*** The god makes a divine weapon attack.

***Stunning Glance.*** The god uses Stunning Gaze.

#### Combat

On its turn, the forgotten god prefers Flawed Spellcasting, surrounding itself with *spirit guardians* or blasting creatures with *flame strike*. It tries to be within 10 feet of an enemy so it can attack with its divine weapon if the spell fails. It uses Divine Wrath when available. The god reserves its legendary actions for Stunning Glance, unless most targets have already made their saving throw against it.

#### Variants: Gods Of Other Domains

The forgotten god above was once a fire, light, or war god. The variants below are gods who presided over other divine domains.

***Forgotten Death God.*** Instead of *flame strike*, this god casts *contagion* with Flawed Spellcasting.

It has disadvantage on Charisma ability checks and becomes vulnerable to all damage. The target makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. After 3 failures, the target stops making saving throws, and the disease lasts for 7 days. After 3 successes, the effect ends. Any spell or magical effect that removes disease also ends the effect.

***Forgotten Nature God.*** Instead of *flame strike*, this god casts *insect plague* with Flawed Spellcasting.

The creature can see and hear into both the Ethereal and Material Plane but is unaffected by creatures and objects on the Material Plane. It can be seen as a ghostly form by creatures on the Material Plane. It can move in any direction, with each foot of movement up or down costing 2 feet of movement.

If the creature is still on the Ethereal Plane when the dead man�s fingers dies, the creature returns to the Material Plane. If this would cause a creature to appear in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 10 (3d6) force damage.

***Flammable.*** After taking fire damage, the dead man�s fingers catches fire and takes ongoing 11 (2d10) fire damage if it isn�t already suffering ongoing fire damage. It can use an action or bonus action to extinguish this fire.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The dead man�s fingers makes two tendril attacks.

***Tendril (Ethereal or Material Plane).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6)

poison damage. A target on the Material Plane is subject to the Ethereal Shift trait. ***Ethereal Spores (While Bloodied, Ethereal Plane Only).*** Each creature within 30 feet makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) necrotic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies. If a creature killed by this attack remains on the Ethereal Plane for 24 hours, its corpse disintegrates, and a new dead man�s fingers sprouts from its place.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Telekinetic Pull (Ethereal or Material Plane).*** One creature within 90 feet makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is magically pulled up to 60 feet straight towards the dead man�s fingers.

#### Combat

The dead man�s fingers uses Telekinetic Pull to move a distant creature near it. It uses Ethereal Spores if there are creatures within range on the Ethereal Plane.

height on their opponent, especially when fighting a creature with a nonmagical bladed weapon.

#### Variant: Drainpipe Gargoyle

The drainpipe gargoyle has the following additional action:

***Spit (Recharge 5*�*6).*** The gargoyle spits a steam of water 5 feet wide and 30 feet long.

***Earth Glide.*** The divi can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The divi�s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** *alter self* (can assume Medium or Large form), *detect magic*, *stone shape*

**3/day each:** *creation*, *move earth*, *passwall*, *tongues*

**1/day each:** *conjure elemental* (earth elemental only), *plane shift* (to Elemental Plane of Earth only)

***Siege Monster.*** The divi deals double damage to objects and structures.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The divi makes two melee attacks.

***Crushing Hand.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*

+10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the divi can�t use Crushing Hand on another target and has advantage on Crushing Hand attacks against this target, and the target can�t breathe.

***Quake (Recharge 5-6).*** Amid deafening rumbling, the ground shakes in a 10-foot radius around a point on an earth or stone surface within 90 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain. Each non-elemental creature in the area makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) thunder damage and falling prone on a failure or taking half damage on a success.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Stone Wall (1/Day).*** A permanent stone wall magically rises from an earth or stone surface within 60 feet. The wall is 6 inches thick and can be up to 20 feet high and 30 feet long. If it appears in a creature�s space, the creature can choose which side of the wall to move to. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall is an object with AC 18 and 30 hit points.

#### Combat

Div prefer to fight while standing on earth or stone. They attack with surprise and ambush ranged creatures using their burrow speed. A divi usually grabs spellcasters and ranged attackers in its crushing hand while

engaging melee combatants with its club. It uses Stone Wall to separate opponents so that it can fight them individually. A divi fights until pushed to the brink of defeat. It burrows to safety if reduced to 34 hit points or fewer.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

***Lightning Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (10d6) lightning damage.

***Scimitar Sweep (1/Day, Giant Form Only).*** The djinni makes a scimitar attack against each creature of its choice within its reach.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Giant Form (1/Day, While Not Bloodied).*** The djinni magically becomes a Huge, semi-substantial creature of billowing cloud. In this form, it gains resistance to nonmagical damage, and its scimitar attacks gain a reach of 10 feet. The effect ends after 1 minute, when the djinni is incapacitated, or if the djinni becomes bloodied.

***Whirlwind (1/Day).*** A magical,

5-foot-wide, 30-foot-tall whirlwind appears in a space the djinni can see within 60 feet. The whirlwind may appear in another creature�s space. If the whirlwind appears in another creature�s space, or when it enters a creature�s space for the first time on a turn, the creature makes a DC 18 Strength check, becoming restrained by the whirlwind on a failure. The whirlwind may restrain one creature at a time. A

creature within 5 feet of the whirlwind (including the restrained creature) can use an action to make a DC 18 Strength check, freeing the restrained creature on a success. A freed creature can move to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the whirlwind.

As a bonus action, the djinni can move the whirlwind up to 30 feet, moving a restrained creature with it. The whirlwind disappears if the djinni loses sight of it, if the djinni dies or is incapacitated, or if the djinni dismisses it as an action.

#### Combat

The djinni begins combat by taking Giant Form, then using Scimitar Sweep if it can target four or more foes. Otherwise, it uses Whirlwind to move a melee attacker far away or draw a ranged attacker close.

Once the djinni is bloodied and can�t use its Giant Form, it flies away unless it can complete some important objective by remaining.

#### Djinni Variant: Djinni Noble

The djinni noble is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 11 monsters (14,400 XP). It has 344 (30d10 + 180, bloodied 172) hit points. It has the following additional traits:

***Magic Resistance.*** While bloodied, the djinni noble has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. ***Wish.*** Three times per year, the djinni noble can cast *wish* for a mortal, using no material components.

The djinni noble has the following additional reactions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Answering Scimitar.*** When a creature within 5 feet that the djinni can see misses the djinni noble with a melee attack, the djinni may make a scimitar

attack against its attacker. The djinni then flies up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. At the end of this movement, the djinni can make a second scimitar attack.

***Lightning Blast.*** When the djinni noble takes damage, it uses Lightning Blast.

A creature also takes 18 (4d8) fire damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The wall disappears when the efreet is killed or incapacitated, or when it uses an action to dismiss it.

#### Combat

The efreeti prefers to fight in melee, although it will sometimes take to the sky and hurl flame at targets with inferior ranged options. It uses its Fiery Wall to burn at least two enemies. It uses Kick to push enemies into the wall or other hazards. Efreet are fearless and only retreat if doing so gives them a tactical advantage.

***Amphibious.*** The marid can breathe air and water.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The marid�s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** *alter self* (can assume Medium or Large form), *create or destroy water*, *detect magic*, *purify food and drink*

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The marid makes two trident attacks. One of these can be replaced with a net attack.

***Trident.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:*

+10 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage. If thrown, the trident returns to the marid�s hand.

***Net.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one target. *Hit:* A Large, Medium, or Small target is restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 18 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net is an object with AC 10, 20 hit points, vulnerability to slashing damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Fog Cloud (1/Day).*** The marid magically creates a heavily obscured area of fog (or, if underwater, inky water) in a 30-foot radius around a point it can see within 60 feet. The fog spreads around corners and can be dispersed by a moderate wind or current (at least 10 miles per hour).

Otherwise, it disperses after 10 minutes. The marid can see through this fog.

***Water Jet (While Bloodied).*** The marid shoots water in a 5-foot-wide,

60-foot-long jet. Each creature in the area makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.

On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet away from the marid, to a maximum of 60 feet away, and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half damage.

#### Combat

Marids begin combat by creating a fog cloud. Within this cloud, they have a tactical advantage against blinded foes, and will attack with their trident and water jet. When forced to fight outside their fog cloud, marids use their flight and swim speed to

stay away from slower melee opponents, and use Water Jet to push away creatures who are too close. They may use their net to restrain a foe and concentrate their attacks on that foe. Marids flee once bloodied, unless they have an overpowering reason to stand their ground.

#### Marid Variant: Marid Noble

The marid noble is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 11 monsters (14,400 XP). It has 344 (30d10 + 180, bloodied 172) hit points. It has the following additional traits:

***Elite Recovery.*** At the end of each of its turns while bloodied, the marid noble ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can do so as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.

***Wish.*** Three times per year, the marid can cast *wish* for a mortal, using no material components.

The marid noble has the following additional reaction, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Water Jet.*** When the marid takes damage, it uses Water Jet if it can include the attacker in the area.

***Undead Nature.*** A ghost doesn�t require air, sustenance, or sleep.

***Unquiet Spirit.*** If defeated in combat, the ghost returns in 24 hours. It can be put to rest permanently only by finding and casting *remove curse* on its remains or by resolving the unfinished business that keeps it from journeying to the afterlife.

###### ACTIONS

***Withering Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*

+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage. If the target is frightened, it is magically aged 1d4 x 10 years. The aging effect can be reversed with a *greater restoration* spell.

***Ethereal Jaunt.*** The ghost magically shifts from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane or vice versa. If it wishes, it can be visible to creatures on one plane while on the other.

***Horrifying Visage.*** Each non-undead creature within 60 feet and on the same plane of existence that can see the ghost makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature�s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is

immune to this ghost�s Horrifying Visage for 24 hours.

***Possession (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid within 5 feet makes a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is possessed by the ghost. The possessed creature is unconscious. The ghost enters the creature�s body and takes control of it.

The ghost can be targeted only by effects that turn undead, and it retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It grants its host body immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed creature�s statistics and actions instead of its own. It doesn�t gain access to the creature�s memories but does gain access to proficiencies, nonmagical class features and traits, and nonmagical actions. It can�t use

limited-used abilities or class traits that require spending a resource. The possession ends after 24 hours, when the body drops to 0 hit points, when the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or when the ghost is turned or affected by dispel evil and good or a similar effect. Additionally, the possessed creature repeats its saving throw whenever it takes damage. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in a space within 5 feet of the body. A creature is immune to this ghost�s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on its saving throw or after the possession ends.

###### REACTIONS

***Horrifying Visage.*** If the ghost takes damage from an attack or spell, it uses Horrifying Visage.

#### Combat

The ghost tries to possess a creature, not always with hostile intent. If it�s attacked while possessing a creature, it fights back with the possessed creature�s weapons. If it fails to possess a creature and is attacked, it uses its Horrifying Visage (as a reaction if possible) and then makes withering touch attacks against frightened enemies. If reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, it retreats to the Ethereal Plane.

#### Variant: Vengeful Ghost

The vengeful ghost is CR 8 (3,900 XP). It has the following trait:

***Graveborn Strength.*** When not in sunlight, creatures make their saving throws against the ghost�s Horrifying Visage and Possession abilities with disadvantage.

#### Variants: Other Ghost Abilities

You can give a ghost one or more of the actions below, in addition to its other actions.

***Drain Heat.*** The ghost magically drains the heat from a 15-foot-radius area around it. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage can�t regain hit points until the start of the ghost�s next turn.

***Pyrokinesis.*** The ghost magically ignites up to three flammable, unattended, nonmagical objects it can see within 30 feet. Each creature within 5 feet of an object when it ignites makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

***Spew Ectoplasm.*** The ghost vomits a spray of ectoplasm in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature is rattled until the end of its next turn. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Telekinetic Shove.*** The ghost targets one Large or smaller creature within 60 feet. The target makes a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the ghost magically moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward. If the target strikes an object, such as a wall, it takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and falls prone. If the target would strike another creature, that creature must

succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

A *greater restoration* spell or similar magic removes the reduction.

#### Combat

A flesh guardian prefers to slam creatures in melee. When its Lightning Bolt is available, it uses it immediately, without much regard for catching multiple creatures in the blast. It tends to use its Lightning Bolt on distant and flying attackers. It throws objects only if it can�t reach any foes. A flesh guardian possesses a greater sense of

self-preservation than most guardians. It avoids fire when it can and may retreat from a battle to save itself.

###### REACTIONS

#### Combat

The iron guardian�s strategy is determined by its programming. It may attack the closest enemy, or it may be instructed to attack only certain targets, such as the first one to touch an item it was protecting.

***Immutable Form.*** The guardian is immune to any effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The guardian has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

***Spell Storing.*** A spellcaster wearing the guardian�s amulet can use the guardian to store a spell. The spellcaster casts a spell using a 4th-level or lower spell slot on the guardian, choosing any spell parameters. The spell has no effect when thus cast.

The guardian can cast this spell once, using no components, when ordered to do so by its master or under other pre- defined circumstances. When a spell is stored in the guardian, any previously stored spell is lost.

slowed for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Combat

The stone guardian�s strategy is determined by its programming. Most commonly, it attacks the closest enemy first. It moves to include at least two creatures within range before using Slow. It throws a rock or other object if it can�t reach an enemy on its turn.

#### Stone Guardian Variant: Stone Colossus

The stone colossus is a legendary CR 16 (15,000 XP) monster. It is Gargantuan, has 263 (17d20 + 85; bloodied 131) hit points, and has the following additional traits:

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the colossus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it crumbles and cracks, losing 20 hit points.

***Siege Monster.*** The colossus deals double damage to objects and structures.

The colossus can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Seize.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (4d4 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the colossus can�t seize a different creature.

***Fling.*** The colossus throws one Large or smaller object or creature it is grappling up to 60 feet. The target lands prone and takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. If the colossus throws the target at another creature, that creature makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking the same damage on a failure.

***Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it makes a DC

18 Strength check, falling prone on a failure.

***Bolt from the Blue (Costs 2 Actions).*** If the colossus is outside, it calls a bolt of energy down from the sky, hitting a point on the ground or water within 120 feet. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius,

sky-high cylinder centered on that point makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. The colossus can choose to make the bolt deal fire or radiant damage instead of lightning.

## Hags

Although hags appear humanoid, they are in fact fey creatures that prey upon humanoid and faerie folk alike.

On a failed saving throw, the target is cursed with a magical hex that lasts 30 days. The curse ends early if the target suffers harm from the hag or if the hag ends it as an action. Roll 1d4:

1. *Charm Hex.* The target is charmed by the hag.
2. *Fear Hex.* The target is frightened of the hag.
3. *Ill Fortune Hex.* The hag magically divines the target�s activities. Whenever the target attempts a long-duration task such as a craft or downtime activity, the hag can cause the activity to fail.
4. *Sleep Hex.* The target falls unconscious. The curse ends early if the target takes damage or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake.

***Invisibility (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** The hag is invisible for 1 hour. The spell ends if the hag attacks, uses Hex, or casts a spell.

#### Combat

#### Variant: Coven Green Hag

The coven green hag is CR 5 (1,800 XP). Its type is fey (shapechanger). It has 97

(15d8 + 30; bloodied 48) hit points and the following additional actions:

***Evil.*** The hag radiates an Evil aura. ***Magic Resistance.*** The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

###### ACTIONS

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the target is subject to the hag�s Curse trait.

***Sleep Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target falls asleep for 4 hours or until it takes damage or is shaken awake. Once

the hag successfully hits a target, it can�t make this attack again until it finishes a long rest.

***Shapeshift.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid. Equipment it is carrying isn�t transformed. It retains its claws in any form. It has no true form and remains in its current form when it dies.

***Planar Travel (3/Day).*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.

Alternatively, the hag is magically transported to the Material Plane, Hell, or the Abyss, arriving within 10 miles of its desired destination.

***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping creature that is under the night hag�s Curse and is not protected by a magic circle or *protection from evil and good* spell or similar magic. As long as the touch persists, the target has terrible nightmares. If the nightmares last for 1 hour, the target gains a level of strife and gains no benefit from the rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10) until the curse ends. If this effect reduces the target�s hit points maximum to 0, the target dies and the hag captures its soul. The reduction to the target�s hit point maximum lasts until removed by *greater restoration* or similar magic.

#### Combat

The night hag hits as many creatures as possible with its claws and then escapes to the Ethereal Plane. Its goal in combat isn�t to kill but to curse. It returns later to haunt victims of its curse.

When a night hag reduces a lone creature to 0 hit points with its claws, it often knocks the creature out rather than killing it. It prefers Nightmare Haunting to mere killing.

#### Variant: Coven Night Hag

The caster makes a DC 14 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the spell fails, and the hag gains 5 (1d10) temporary hit points per level of the spell slot used.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Horrific Transformation.*** The hag briefly takes on a terrifying form or reveals its true form. Each creature within 30 feet that can see the hag makes a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. A creature under the hag�s curse automatically fails this saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. If a creature�s saving throw is successful, it is immune to the hag�s Horrific Transformation for 24 hours.

#### Combat

The hag uses Horrific Transformation to frighten as many creatures as possible and then uses Death Glare on one of them. If no creatures are frightened or if it is bloodied, the hag flees, using its swim speed if possible. It attacks with its claws only if cornered.

#### Variant: Coven Sea Hag

***Ice Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) cold damage, and the target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature under the hag�s curse automatically fails this saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained as it begins to turn to ice. At the end of the creature�s next turn, the creature repeats the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified

into ice. This petrification can be removed with *greater restoration* or similar magic. ***Shapeshift.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form.

Equipment it is carrying isn�t transformed. It retains a streak of white hair in any form. It returns to its true form if it dies.

***Invisibility (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** The hag is invisible for 1 hour. The spell ends if the hag attacks or casts a spell.

###### REACTIONS

***Ice Shield.*** The hag adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it made by a creature it can see. If the attack misses, the attacker takes 14 (4d6) cold damage.

#### Combat

If the hag has allies to protect it, it attacks with ice bolt from a distance. If alone, it attacks melee combatants with its claws while firing ice bolts against a ranged attacker. When the hag is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, it turns invisible and tries to escape.

#### Variant: Coven Winter Hag

The coven winter hag is CR 9 (5,000 XP). It has 135 (18d8 + 54; bloodied 67) hit points and the following additional trait:

***Expanded Spell List.*** The hag can cast *cone of cold* and *wall of ice* once per day each.

The hag has the following additional actions:

***Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S).*** Frost blasts from the hag in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

minutes. Each 10-foot section has AC 12, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. Destroying a 10-foot section of wall leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the section occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

If the wall enters a creature�s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (hag�s choice). The creature then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

## Half-Dragons

When draconic blood flows through the veins of a non-dragon, that creature comes to exhibit dragon- like characteristics.

#### Half-Dragon Template

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. It keeps its statistics, except as follows.

***Languages.*** If the half-dragon knows languages, it speaks Draconic in addition to the ones it knows.

***Senses.*** The half-dragon gains blindsight out to a distance of 10 feet and darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet.

***Resistances.*** The half-dragon gains resistance to a damage type dealt by the breath weapon of its dragon half.

***Breath Weapon.*** The half-dragon uses the Breath Weapon attack of the oldest dragon of its type that has a Challenge Rating equal to or lower than the

half-dragon�s Challenge Rating (minimum wyrmling).

***Wings.*** If the half-dragon�s Challenge Rating is 9 or higher, it gains wings and a fly speed of 60.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Luring Song.*** The harpy sings a magical song. Each humanoid and giant within 300 feet that can hear it makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature becomes charmed until the harpy fails to use its bonus action to continue the song. While charmed by the harpy, a creature is incapacitated and ignores other harpy songs. On each of its

turns, the creature moves towards the harpy by the most direct route, not avoiding opportunity attacks or hazards. The creature repeats its saving throw whenever it is damaged and before it enters damaging terrain such as lava. If a saving throw is successful or the effect ends on it, it is immune to any harpy�s song for the next 24 hours.

#### Combat

The harpy uses its Luring Song continuously whenever enemies are within 300 feet. It prefers to attack creatures charmed by it and evade creatures that attack it in melee. It flees if it is bloodied while no creatures are charmed by it.

A siren has a swim speed of 40, no fly speed, and can breathe and sing both in air and underwater.

#### Combat

Hobgoblins try to move and attack in formation, staying within 5 feet of an ally. The first hobgoblin to approach an enemy often readies an action to attack when it�s joined by an ally. Hobgoblins look for advantages that can be found from cover, darkness, flanking, or terrain. Hobgoblins retreat only when ordered to or when all superiors are killed and they are reduced to half their original number. Even when retreating, one hobgoblin sometimes remains behind to hold off an enemy while the others withdraw.

#### Languages �

***Hold Breath.*** The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** When the hydra fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, its heads lose coordination. It is rattled until the end of its next turn.

***Multiple Heads.*** While the hydra has more than one head, it has advantage on Perception checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and it can�t be flanked.

***Reactive Heads.*** For each head it has, the hydra can take one reaction per round, but not more than one per turn.

***Regenerating Heads.*** The hydra has five heads. Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in one turn, one of its heads dies. If all of its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows

2 heads for each head that was killed since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn.

***Toxic Secretions.*** Water within 1 mile of the hydra�s lair is poisoned. A creature other than the hydra that is immersed in the water or drinks the water makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 24 hours. On a success, the creature is immune to this poison for 24 hours.

***Wakeful.*** When some of the hydra�s heads are asleep, others are awake.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The hydra bites once with each of its heads.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The hydra can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Rush.*** The hydra moves or swims up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement would pass through the space of creatures that are not incapacitated or prone, each creature makes a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone and the hydra can enter its space without treating it as difficult terrain. On a success, the hydra can�t enter the creature�s space, and the hydra�s movement ends. If this movement ends while the hydra is sharing a space with a creature, the creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.

***Wrap.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. *Hit:* The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained until this grappled ends. The hydra can grapple one creature for each of its heads. When one of the hydra�s heads is killed

while it is grappling a creature, the creature

that killed the head can choose one

creature to free from the grapple.

#### Combat

The hydra prefers not to venture more than 30 feet from the water and attacks with surprise if it can. It doesn�t coordinate all its attacks against a single melee opponent if there are several targets available. In melee, it usually uses one legendary action to wrap an opponent and another to rush, escaping with its grappled prey or chasing dangerous ranged attackers. It retreats into deep water if it�s taking excessive damage from ranged attackers it can�t reach.

#### Variant: Pyrohydra

The pyrohydra is CR 13 (10,000 XP), has 218 (19d12 + 95; bloodied 109) hit points, and is immune to fire damage. Its Regenerating Heads trait is replaced with the following trait:

***Regenerating Heads.*** The hydra has seven heads. Whenever the hydra takes 30 or more damage in one turn, one of its heads dies. If all of its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows 2 heads for each head that was killed since its last turn, unless it has taken at least 20 cold damage since its last turn.

The pyrohydra has the following additional action:

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5�6).*** If the pyrohydra has at least four heads, it breathes fire in all directions. Each creature within 30 feet makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 59 (17d6) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The intellect devourer attacks with its claws and uses Ego Whip.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage, and the target gains one level of Strife. If this attack causes the target to reach 3 levels of Strife, the target loses all memories of its past life (not including proficiencies, class features, known spells, and so on) and the intellect devourer gains these memories. A creature regains its memories if it is subject to *greater restoration* or the intellect devourer is killed.

***Ego Whip.*** The intellect devourer targets a creature with a brain within 60 feet. The target makes a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and is rattled for 1 minute. If it is already rattled by Ego Whip, it is also stunned. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending both effects on a success.

***Body Thief.*** The intellect devourer enters the nose and mouth of an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet. The target must be Small or larger, have a brain, and have an Intelligence of 4 or higher. The intellect devourer eats the target�s brain and takes control of the target. The intellect devourer leaves the body if the target is reduced to 0 hit points, if the target is affected by *dispel evil and good* or another effect that ends possession, or voluntarily as a bonus action. A creature killed by the intellect devourer can be

restored to life by resurrection or similar magic.

While the intellect devourer is in control of the target, the intellect devourer retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, its telepathy, and its knowledge of Deep Speech. It otherwise uses the target�s statistics, including proficiencies, languages, class features, and spells. It has vague knowledge about the target�s life but must make a DC 15 Intelligence check to recall specific facts.

#### Combat

The intellect devourer prefers to ambush lone or outnumbered creatures. It uses Ego Whip on whichever opponent it believes has the best combination of low intelligence and high combat ability. Once a creature is stunned, it devours its brain. The intellect devourer flees if it and its allies are outnumbered or if it�s bloodied.

#### Combat

The invisible stalker single-mindedly targets its quarry. If it�s getting the worst of combat, it retreats but does not give up. It stalks its target, replacing its direct assaults with

hit-and-run raids spread out over days: attacking when its quarry is alone, setting up traps, pushing its enemy off a cliff, and the like.

#### Variant: Invisible Render

The invisible render is CR 8 (3,900 XP) and has 123 (19d8 + 38; bloodied 61) hit points. Its Intelligence is 3 (�4) and it cannot speak or understand any languages. It has the following trait:

***Truth Aversion.*** The jackalwere is incapable of making a completely true statement.

###### ACTIONS

***Bite (Jackal or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Scimitar (Human or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

***Sleep Gaze (Gaze, Hybrid Form Only).*** One creature within 30 feet of the jackalwere makes a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is magically charmed. At the beginning of the jackalwere�s next turn, the target repeats the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature falls unconscious for 10 minutes. Both the charmed and unconscious conditions end if the target takes damage or a creature within reach of the target uses an action to shake the target back to its senses. If the target successfully saves against Sleep Gaze, it is immune to Sleep Gaze for 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to charm aren�t affected by it.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Shapeshift.*** The jackalwere magically changes its form, along with its equipment, to that of a specific Medium humanoid or a jackal-human hybrid or its true form, which is a Small jackal. While shapeshifted, its statistics are otherwise unchanged. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

#### Combat

The jackalwere shifts to hybrid form and uses Sleep Gaze on an unsuspecting target. It then fights with its scimitar, staying next to at least one ally. A jackalwere is fearless when facing enemies armed with mundane weapons, but it retreats if it is outnumbered by enemies capable of bypassing its resistances.

#### Variant: Jackalwere Pack Leader

The jackalwere pack leader is CR 2 (450 XP) and has 36 (8d8) hit points. It has the following action:

***Multiattack.*** The jackalwere makes two scimitar attacks or makes one scimitar attack and uses Sleep Gaze.

## Khalkoi

Khalkoi, more commonly known as mind wasps, are parasitic predators that feed on

the cosmic principles of good and evil, law and chaos.

#### Disease: Brain Larvae

A khalkos can infect an intelligent creature with a horrifying disease, injecting khalkos larvae directly into the creature�s skull.

While infected with this disease, the host undergoes the following changes:

***Telepathy.*** The host gains telepathy out to a radius of 120 feet. Additionally, the host can telepathically communicate with the khalkos that infected it over any distance, as long as they are on the same plane.

***Trust.*** Whenever a khalkos makes a Charisma check to convince the host of its good intentions, it does so with advantage. If it succeeds, the host becomes friendly to it no matter its previous attitude.

After 10 (3d6) days, the host develops a splitting headache and is incapacitated for 24 hours. At the end of this time, the host dies, and 2 or 3 khalkos spawn burst out of the host�s skull after 1 round. Each khalkos spawn gains the host's languages and memories.

This disease can only be detected or cured by a spell cast with a 5th-level or higher spell slot. It can't be cured by effects that don't require a spell slot. Creatures without a head are immune to this disease.

###### REACTIONS

#### Combat

The khalkos starts combat by using Chaos Pheromones on clusters of enemies, and then uses Psionic Sting on either a creature with an alignment or a creature likely to fail an Intelligence saving throw. Once an enemy is stunned, the khalkos uses Brain Jab. The khalkos retreats once it has infected a target with brain larvae (possibly using *plane shift* if it hasn�t already today).

If a swallowed creature deals 50 or more damage to the kraken in a single turn, or if the kraken dies, the kraken vomits up the creature.

***Ink Cloud.*** While underwater, the kraken exudes a cloud of ink in a 90-foot-radius sphere. The ink extends around corners, and the area is heavily obscured until the end of the kraken�s next turn or until a strong current dissipates the cloud. Each non-kraken creature in the area when the cloud appears makes a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 27 (5d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute.

A target makes a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage or half damage on a save.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 26). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. A tentacle can be targeted individually by an attack. It shares the kraken�s hit points, but if 30 damage is dealt to the tentacle, it releases a creature it is grappling. The kraken can grapple up to 10 creatures.

***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a straight line. The target lands prone and takes 21 (6d6)

bludgeoning damage. If the kraken throws the target at another creature, that creature makes a DC 26 saving throw, taking the same damage on a failure.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Tentacle.*** The kraken makes one tentacle attack.

***Fling.*** The kraken uses Fling.

***Squeeze (Costs 2 Actions).*** The kraken ends any magical effect that is restraining it or reducing its movement and then swims up to half its swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, it can fit through gaps as narrow as 10 feet wide without squeezing.

#### Combat

The kraken summons a lightning storm and doesn�t attack until the storm has arrived.

On its turn, it takes actions in this order of preference: it uses Lightning if it can hit 3 threatening targets, bites if it has a creature grappled, or uses Ink Cloud if underwater. Otherwise, it bites. With its legendary actions, it attacks with its tentacle, or uses Fling if it already has two creatures grappled (saving one of the creatures to bite and swallow). It uses Squeeze to escape confinement and escapes in an Ink Cloud if reduced to 111 hit points or fewer.

that starts its turn in the area takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

The Kraken has the following additional actions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Elite Recovery.*** The Kraken ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can use this action as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.

A spellcaster who seeks knowledge above all else may turn to fell rituals to transcend the limitations of mortality, becoming a lich, an undead being of immense power.

***Soul Vessels.*** A lich binds its soul within a specially prepared object inscribed with magical sigils of power, warding, and binding. This soul vessel maintains the lich�s existence and ensures its survival. Should a lich�s body be destroyed, the soul vessel regenerates it, restoring the lich�s mind and will. Breaking a soul vessel is the only way to permanently destroy a lich. Most liches go to great lengths to protect these objects. Some soul vessels are nearly invulnerable and can be destroyed only by a specific method, such as bathing it in elemental fire. Others are carefully concealed or hidden in plain sight, though their magic nature is

apparent to anyone who can detect magic. Some powerful liches even create several soul vessels scattered throughout their domain.

###### ACTIONS

***Paralyzing Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:*

+12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (4d6 + 5) cold damage. The target makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.

***Arc Lightning.*** The lich targets up to 3 creatures within 60 feet. Each target makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 28 (8d6) lightning damage.

***Fire Bolt (Cantrip; S).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) fire damage.

***Thunderwave (1st-Level; S).*** Thunder rolls from the lich in a 15-foot cube. Each creature in the area makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet from the lich. On a success, a creature takes half damage and is not pushed.

***Blur (2nd-Level; V, Concentration).*** The lich's form is blurred for 1 minute. Attack rolls against it are made with disadvantage unless the attacker has senses that allow them to perceive without sight or to see through illusions (like blindsight or truesight).

***Fireball (3rd-Level; S, M).*** Fire streaks from the lich to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius, spreading around corners. Each creature in the area

makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

***Confusion (4th-Level; S, M, Concentration).*** Each creature within 10 feet of a point the lich can see within 120 feet makes a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, becoming rattled until the end of its next turn on a success. On a failure, a creature is confused for 1 minute and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Disintegrate (6th-Level; S, M).*** The lich disintegrates a target within 60 feet. A Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, or a

10-foot-cube section thereof, is automatically destroyed. A creature makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 75 (10d6 + 40) force damage on a failed save. If reduced to 0 hit points, the creature and its nonmagical gear are disintegrated, and the creature can be restored to life only with *true resurrection* or *wish*.

***Finger of Death (7th-Level; S).*** A creature within 60 feet makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 61 (7d8

+ 30) necrotic damage on a failed saving throw or half damage on a success. A humanoid killed by this spell turns into a zombie under the lich�s control at the start of the lich�s next turn.

***Power Word Stun (8th-Level; V).*** The lich targets a creature within 60 feet. If the target has more than 150 hit points, it is rattled until the end of its next turn.

Otherwise, it is stunned. It can make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Eldritch Aura.*** The lich surrounds itself with a magical, rune-covered, glowing, translucent aura in a 10-foot radius. The aura moves with the lich and casts dim light inside its area. The aura disappears at the beginning of the lich�s next turn.

**Death Aura.** The aura casts purple light. Each living creature that ends its turn

inside the aura takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage, and the lich regains the same number of hit points.

**Shield Aura.** The aura casts orange light. It has 35 hit points. Whenever the lich would take damage, the aura takes the damage instead, and the aura visibly weakens. If the damage reduces the aura to 0 hit points, the aura disappears, and the lich takes any excess damage.

**Spell Shield Aura.** The aura casts blue light. Any spell cast with a 5th-level or lower spell slot from outside the aura can�t affect anything inside the aura.

Using a spell to target something inside the aura or include the aura�s space in an area has no effect on anything inside.

###### REACTIONS

***Sabotage Spell.*** When a creature within 60 feet casts a spell that targets the lich, the lich attempts to interrupt it. The lich makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spell�s level. On a success, the spell fails, and the caster takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

***Shield (1st-Level; V, S).*** When the lich is hit by an attack or targeted by *magic missile*, it gains a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the beginning of its next turn.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Cast Spell.*** The lich casts a cantrip or a 1st-level spell. The lich can use 2 legendary actions to cast a 2nd-level spell or 3 legendary actions to cast a 3rd-level spell.

***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich uses Paralyzing Touch.

***Arc Lightning (Costs 3 Actions).*** The lich uses Arc Lightning.

#### Combat

With its bonus action, the lich uses Eldritch Aura to foil its most dangerous foes, using Death Aura against melee attackers, Shield Aura against ranged attackers, and Spell Shield against spellcasters. It uses its legendary actions to target groups of foes with Arc Lightning or uses Paralyzing Touch against creatures that might fail the Constitution saving throw. It might also cast *Blur*.

With its action, the lich casts *confusion* or *fireball* against a cluster of enemies; *disintegrate* against a creature that might fail a Dexterity saving throw; *finger of death* against a creature that might fail a Constitution saving throw; or *power word stun* against any dangerous opponent.

When bloodied, it uses *dimension door* to escape unless defending its soul vessel. If it defeats a group, it prefers to leave several foes alive, using *geas* to impose a dangerous quest that furthers its research.

**Languages** Abyssal, Common, Infernal, telepathy 60 ft.

***Cloaked Mind.*** When subjected to a divination effect that detects fiends or alignment, the malcubus makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the malcubus�s nature is not detected.

***Evil.*** The malcubus radiates an Evil aura. ***Telepathic Bond.*** The malcubus can communicate telepathically with a charmed creature over any distance, even on a different plane of existence.

###### ACTIONS

***Claw (Malcubus Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

***Charm.*** The malcubus targets one humanoid on the same plane of existence within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is magically charmed for 1 day or until the malcubus charms another creature. The charmed creature obeys the malcubus�s commands. The creature repeats the saving throw whenever it takes damage or if it receives a suicidal command. If a creature�s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to any malcubus�s Charm for 24 hours.

***Draining Kiss.*** The malcubus kisses a willing or charmed creature. The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. The target�s hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount until it finishes a long rest, and the malcubus regains hit points equal to the same amount. If the target is charmed by the malcubus, the charm ends.

***Etherealness.*** The malcubus magically travels to the Ethereal Plane. While on the Ethereal Plane, the malcubus can see and hear into the Material Plane and can choose to make itself audible and hazily visible to creatures on the Material Plane. If a humanoid on the Material Plane invites the malcubus to do so, the malcubus can use an action to magically travel from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane.

***Dream (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the malcubus magically touches a sleeping humanoid that is not protected by a *magic circle* or *protection from evil and good* spell or similar magic. While the touch persists, the malcubus appears in the creature�s dreams. The creature can end the dream at any time. If the dream lasts for 1 hour, the target gains a level of strife and gains no benefit from the rest, and the malcubus can use Charm on the creature even if it�s on a different plane of existence.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Shapeshift.*** The malcubus magically changes its form to a Medium or Small humanoid or into its true form. It can fly only in its true form. While shapeshifted, its statistics are unchanged except for its size and speed. Its equipment is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

###### REACTIONS

***Living Shield.*** When a creature the malcubus can see hits it with an attack, the malcubus can give an order to a creature charmed by it within 5 feet. The charmed creature uses its reaction, if available, to swap places with the malcubus. The attack hits the charmed creature instead of the malcubus.

#### Combat

The malcubus tries to avoid combat. When it can�t, it charms an opponent, giving orders to it and using it as a living shield. Once it has charmed a creature, it uses its claws.

When bloodied, it uses Charming Kiss. It flees to the Ethereal Plane only in dire straits, since it may have difficulty returning. Manticore

Terrible amalgamations of lion and dragon, manticores have tails tipped with clusters of bony spikes and the faces of scowling humanoids.

***Multiattack.*** The manticore attacks with its bite and its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. If the manticore moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack, the target makes a DC 13 Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

***Tail Spike Volley (4/Day).*** The manticore fires tail spikes in a 5-foot-wide,

60-foot-long line. Each creature in the area makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) piercing damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

###### REACTIONS

***Tail Whip.*** If a creature the manticore can see hits it with a melee attack, the manticore attacks the attacker with its tail. If it hits, it can fly up to half its fly speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the attacker.

#### Combat

The manticore fires a tail spike volley from a distance, preferably from the air. It then flies past an opponent, attacking with its tail from 10 feet away to avoid opportunity attacks.

Finally, it charges at least 20 feet and attacks with its claws and bite. If bloodied, it falls back and uses the rest of its tail spikes. It flees only if its tail spike volleys have been depleted.

#### Variant: Adamanticore

The adamanticore is CR 4 (1,100 XP) and has 85 (10d10 + 30; bloodied 42) hit points.

A creature that takes damage from the adamanticore�s Tail Spike Volley also suffers 5 (1d10) ongoing damage from blood loss. The ongoing damage lasts until a creature uses an action to remove the spikes.

***Petrifying Gaze.*** When a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the medusa and can see the medusa�s eyes, it can choose to avert its eyes until the beginning of its next turn unless it is surprised or incapacitated. Otherwise, the medusa uses its petrifying gaze on the creature. If the medusa sees its own reflection and doesn�t avert its eyes, it is subject to its own gaze.

A creature subject to the medusa�s petrifying gaze makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If it rolls a natural 1 on the save, it is petrified instantly. If it otherwise fails the save, it is restrained as it begins to be petrified. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success and becoming petrified on a failure. The petrification can be removed with *greater restoration* or similar powerful magic.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The medusa makes any combination of two attacks with its snake hair and longbow.

***Snake Hair.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, plus an additional 3 (1d6) piercing damage if the target is a creature that is surprised or that can�t see the medusa.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

#### Combat

The medusa ambushes (or otherwise reveals its eyes suddenly) so its opponents can�t avert their gaze. It makes melee attacks against creatures with averted eyes. When bloodied, it hides if possible, setting up further ambushes.

#### Variant: Medusa Queen

The medusa queen is a legendary monster and is CR 11 (7,200 XP) with 153 (18d10 + 54; bloodied 76) hit points. It has one legendary action it can take at the end of another creature�s turn, choosing from the options below. The medusa queen regains the spent legendary action at the start of its turn.

***Hide.*** The medusa moves up to half its Speed and hides.

***Snake Hair.*** The medusa makes a snake hair attack.

***Frenzy of Snakes (1/Day, When Bloodied).*** The medusa makes a snake hair attack against each creature within 5 feet.

***Imperious Command.*** A creature with averted or covered eyes within 60 feet that can hear the medusa makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw.

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is subjected to the mimic�s Sticky trait.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature stuck to the mimic. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is restrained until it is no longer stuck to the mimic. While a creature is restrained by the mimic, the mimic can�t bite a different creature.

***Swallow.*** The mimic makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature restrained by it. If the attack hits and the mimic has not swallowed another creature, the target is swallowed and no longer stuck to the mimic. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the mimic, is blinded and restrained, and takes 5 (2d4) acid

damage at the start of each of the mimic�s turns.

If a swallowed creature deals 10 or more damage to the mimic in a single turn, or if the mimic dies, the target falls prone in an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the mimic and is no longer swallowed.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Shapeshift.*** The mimic changes its form to resemble an inanimate object of its approximate size or changes into its true form, which is an amorphous blob.

Objects it is carrying or stuck to are not transformed. While shapeshifted, its statistics are unchanged. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

#### Combat

The mimic waits in object form for a creature to touch it and then uses its bite. If a creature within 5 feet of it shows no inclination to touch it, it attacks with its pseudopod and then bites the stuck target. The mimic tries to swallow creatures it has restrained, using its pseudopod to defend itself against other assailants. If the mimic swallows a creature, it shifts to its true form and tries to escape.

#### Variant: Mirage Monster

The mirage monster is a Huge legendary monster. It is CR 4 (1,100 XP) and has 76 (9d12 + 18; bloodied 38) hit points. It has the following trait:

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the mirage monster fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it immediately shapeshifts into its true form if it has not already done so.

The mirage monster can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Grasping Pseudopod.*** The mirage monster makes a pseudopod attack with a range of 15 feet. On a hit, the target makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw.

On a failure, the target is pulled up to 15 feet towards the mirage monster.

***Bite (Costs 2 Actions).*** The mirage monster attacks with its bite.

## Mummies

Cloth wrappings and preservative ointments protect a mummy�s body from rot, even as mystic rituals ensure its spirit remains bound to the mortal realm for all eternity.

***Heart and Amulet.*** A mummy lord�s magical defenses are not limited to guards and booby-traps. Shortly after death, each mummy lord has its heart removed and hidden somewhere in its burial chamber. Until this still-beating heart is silenced, a mummy lord can�t truly be defeated. Even if its body is reduced to ashes, the mummy lord reforms inside its inner sanctum a few days later.

Furthermore, each mummy lord wears a blessed scarab amulet that protects it from harm. When the mummy would fall victim to a deadly hazard, the amulet suffers the consequences instead.

**Curse: Mummy Rot.** A mummy�s touch inflicts a dreadful curse called mummy rot. A cursed creature can�t regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the creature�s total number of Hit Dice for every 24 hours that elapse. If this curse reduces the target�s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and crumbles to dust.

***Dreadful Glare (Gaze).*** The mummy lord targets a creature within 60 feet. The target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.

***Rotting Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is cursed with Mummy Rot.

***Guardian of Faith (2/Day).*** A Large, indistinct spectral guardian appears within an unoccupied space within 30 feet and remains for 8 hours.

On a failure, the creature is diseased, taking 49 (14d6) necrotic damage.

###### REACTIONS

***Blasphemous Counterspell.*** When the mummy lord is targeted by a spell using a 4th-level or lower spell slot, the attacker makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the spell is wasted, and the caster takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage per level of the spell slot.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The mummy lord can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Against foes it deems small and weak, the ogre charges into a group and uses its Sweeping Strike. It attacks a lone foe, or one that has proven itself to be a threat, with its greatclub.

#### Variant: Cave Ogre

The cave ogre is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 2 creatures (900 XP). It has 119 (14d10 + 42; bloodied 59) hit points and the following trait:

***Elite Recovery.*** At the end of each of its turns while bloodied, the ogre can end one condition or effect on itself. It can do this even when unconscious or incapacitated.

The cave ogre has the following additional action, which it can use only while bloodied: ***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (3d6

+ 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure.

The ogre has the following reactions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Reflexive Swat.*** When a creature the ogre can see within 5 feet hits it with a melee attack, the ogre makes a greatclub attack against it.

***Furious Smash (1/Day).*** When it takes damage or is targeted by a spell, the cave ogre roars and smashes the ground, a tree, or another object, sending debris flying in a 30-foot radius around the ogre. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Until the debris is cleared, the area becomes difficult terrain, which the cave ogre ignores.

**At will:** *darkness*, *invisibility*

**1/day:** *charm person*, *cone of cold*, *gaseous form*,

*hold person*

***Iron Magic Resistance.*** While wielding its iron club, the ogre mage has advantage

Whenever the ogre mage rolls a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, the iron club emits visible sparks even if the ogre mage is invisible. ***Regeneration.*** The ogre mage regains 10 hit points at the beginning of its turn as long as it has at least 1 hit point.

###### ACTIONS

***Read Scroll (1/Day).*** The ogre casts a spell from a magical scroll without expending the scroll�s magic.

***Darkness (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** Magical darkness spreads from a point within 30 feet of the ogre, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere and spreading around corners. It remains for 1 minute. A creature with darkvision can�t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can�t illuminate it.

***Hold Person (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** One humanoid the ogre can see within 60 feet makes a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute, repeating the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Invisibility (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** The ogre is invisible for 1 hour. The spell ends if the ogre attacks or casts a spell.

30. It can�t attack, use or drop objects, talk, or cast spells. It can enter another creature�s space and pass through small

holes and cracks but can�t pass through liquid. It is resistant to nonmagical damage, has advantage on Strength, Dexterity and Constitution saving throws, and can�t fall.

***Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S).*** Frost blasts from the ogre in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Shapeshift.*** The ogre changes its form into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form, which is a Large giant. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. Its iron club, armor, and clothing change size with it. It reverts to its true form when it dies.

#### Combat

The ogre mage attacks with surprise, either invisibly or using a harmless-seeming guise. It casts *cone of cold* against closely-packed enemies and *hold person* against a ranged attacker. It then fights with its iron club.

When bloodied, it casts *invisibility*, *darkness*, or *gaseous form* and flies away. Once its hit points have regenerated, it tries to ambush the group that defeated it.

###### ACTIONS

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) acid damage.

***Engulf.*** The cube moves up to its Speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures� spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature�s space, the creature makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. If the creature is unaware of the cube�s presence, it makes its saving throw against Engulf with disadvantage. On a success, the creature may use its reaction, if available, to move up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If the creature doesn�t move, it is engulfed by the cube.

A creature engulfed by the cube takes 10 (3d6) acid damage, can�t breathe, is

restrained, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube�s turns. It can be seen but has total cover. It moves with the cube. The cube can hold as many creatures as fit in its space without squeezing.

An engulfed creature can escape by using an action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, the creature moves to a space within 5 feet of the cube. A creature within 5 feet can take the same action to free an engulfed creature, but takes 10 (3d6) acid damage in the process.

#### Combat

The cube moves constantly, stopping only when its blindsight detects moving creatures. It then waits motionless for creatures to blunder into it. It pursues creatures that move away from it, either Dashing or using the extra movement from its Engulf action.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14) and restrained until the

grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target and can�t attack a different target while doing so.

***Tentacle Slam.*** The otyugh slams any creatures it is grappling into a hard surface or into each other. Each creature makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw.

On a failure, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, is stunned until the end of the otyugh�s next turn, and is pulled up to 5 feet towards the otyugh. On a success, the target takes half damage.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target contracts a disease. While diseased, the target is poisoned. The target repeats the saving throw every 24 hours, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure (to a minimum of 1 hit point) and becoming cured on a success. The reduction in hit points lasts until the disease is cured.

***Swallow.*** If the otyugh has no other creature in its stomach, the otyugh bites a Medium or smaller creature that is stunned. On a hit, the creature is swallowed. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the otyugh, is blinded and restrained, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the otyugh�s turns.

If a swallowed creature deals 15 or more damage to the otyugh in a single turn, or if the otyugh dies, the otyugh vomits up the creature.

#### Combat

The otyugh grasps creatures with its tentacles. If it has two creatures grappled, it uses its Tentacle Slam. If it stuns a target, it swallows it. It retreats once it has swallowed a creature or when it is bloodied.

#### Variant: Ur-Otyugh

The ur-otyugh is a legendary CR 10 (5,900 XP) monster. It has 144 (17d10 + 51; bloodied 72) hit points, a Speed and a swim speed of 50, and the following additional traits:

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the ur-otyugh fails a saving throw, it can

choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it becomes more sluggish. Each time the ur-otyugh uses Legendary Resistance, its Speed and swim speed decrease by 10 and it loses one of its legendary actions on each of its turns.

The ur-otyugh can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Blood-Curdling Scream, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the phase monster by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the

creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn�t have line of sight to the phase monster, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, it is no longer frightened.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Shapeshift.*** The phase monster magically changes its form to that of a Small goat or into its true form. While in goat form, it loses its fly speed and Mirror Image trait. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged in each form.

#### Combat

The phase monster begins combat by using Blood-Curdling Scream. It then charges a foe, preferably one not frightened by its scream. On subsequent turns, if its Mirror Image trait is active, it charges a second foe that�s at least 20 feet away, even if that means triggering an opportunity attack. If its Mirror Image trait is inactive, it instead stands and fights its current opponent. If the phase monster starts its turn bloodied and its Mirror Image trait is inactive, it flies away.

###### ACTIONS

At the end of its next turn, it repeats the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, it falls unconscious for 1 hour. If it takes damage, or a creature uses an action to shake it awake, it wakes up, and the effect ends.

***Telepathic Static (3/Day).*** The pseudodragon targets one creature it can see within 10 feet, forcing it to make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it�s magically stunned until the end of its next turn as it suffers a barrage of telepathic imagery.

#### Languages �

***Tunneler.*** The worm can tunnel through earth and solid rock, leaving behind a 10-foot-diameter tunnel.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The worm attacks two different targets with its bite and its tail stinger.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d10 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target is swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover from attacks from outside the worm, and it takes 24 (7d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm�s turns.

If a swallowed creature deals 35 or more damage to the worm in a single turn, or if the worm dies, the worm vomits up all swallowed creatures.

***Tail Stinger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target makes a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

###### REACTIONS

***Fighting Retreat.*** When a creature makes an opportunity attack on the worm, the worm attacks with either its bite or its tail stinger.

#### Combat

The purple worm usually attacks the foe that makes the most noise, though it may also try to swallow a creature that badly injures it. If attacked from one end while in one of

its narrow tunnels, it burrows in a tight circle so it can attack with both its bite and stinger. In melee, it retreats and advances in order to get both its attacks in play and to make use of its Fighting Retreat reaction.

#### Variant: Ice Worm

The ice worm is resistant to cold damage and immune to fire damage. It has the following trait:

***Sense Heat.*** The worm senses warm-blooded creatures and warm objects within 60 feet.

#### Variant: Sand Worm

The sand worm gains its proficiency bonus (+5) and an expertise die (+1d6) on Stealth checks. It has the following trait:

While shapeshifted, its statistics are unchanged. REACTIONS

***Counterproposal.*** The rakshasa uses Sweet Promises on a creature that attacked it or targeted it with a spell.

#### Combat

The rakshasa avoids fighting powerful enemies, preferring instead to cause mischief from afar. If forced into battle, it fights with its claws while confounding enemies with Counterproposal and Read Thoughts. The rakshasha has no interest in dying and uses Quickened Spell to fly away or flee invisibly when bloodied.

#### Scarecrow Variant: Sandling

Instead of Flammable, the sandling has the following trait:

***Water Soluble.*** If soaked with water, the sandling takes 5 (1d10) ongoing acid damage if it isn�t already suffering ongoing acid damage. The sandling can spend an action to end this damage if it has access to dry sand to repair itself.

Instead of Scare, the sandling has the following action:

***Sandstorm.*** Each creature within 30 feet makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded until the end of its next turn.

#### Scarecrow Variant: Snowman

Instead of Flammable, the snowman has the following trait:

***Meltable.*** If it takes fire damage, or is exposed to warm temperatures for an hour or more, the snowman�s size is reduced to Small.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed up to 15 feet away from the serpent and knocked prone.

#### Vehicle Combat

The serpent attacks a Huge or larger target, such as a ship. It moves into the target�s space and attacks with its coils. It ignores small targets, such as passengers, unless it takes 15 damage or more from a single hit.

It bites melee combatants and tail-swipes ranged attackers, such as archers or ballistas, trying to knock them into the water. The serpent temporarily disengages when it is subjected to a melee critical hit, but it doesn�t flee the battle until it is bloodied. If it takes significant damage while it�s fleeing, it fights to the death with its Thrash action, targeting the Large and smaller creatures that torment it.

#### Underwater Combat

The shambling mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

#### Combat

***Incorporeal.*** The specter can move through creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. If it takes radiant damage or is exposed to sunlight, it loses this trait until the end of its next turn.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the specter has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.

###### ACTIONS

This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Hurl.*** The specter targets a Medium or smaller creature, or an object weighing no more than 150 pounds, within 30 feet of it. A creature makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is hurled up to 30 feet in any direction (including upwards), taking 3 (1d6) damage for every 10 feet it is hurled. An object is launched up to 30 feet in a straight line, and a creature in its path makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failure. On a success, the creature takes no damage, and the object keeps flying past it.

***Fade.*** While not in sunlight, the specter turns invisible and takes the Hide action. It remains invisible for 1 minute or until it uses Life Drain or takes damage. If the specter takes radiant damage or is exposed to sunlight, it can�t use this action until the end of its next turn.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The sphinx attacks twice with its claw.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.

***Dispel Magic (3rd-Level; V, S).*** The sphinx scours the magic from one creature, object, or magical effect within 120 feet that it can see. A spell ends if it was cast with a 3rd-level or lower spell

slot. For spells using a 4th-level or higher spell slot, the sphinx makes a Wisdom ability check (DC 10 + the spell�s level) for each one, ending the effect on a success. ***Flame Strike (5th-Level; V, S).*** A column of divine flame fills a 10-foot-radius,

40-foot-high cylinder within 60 feet. Creatures in the area make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Speed Time (1/Day, While Bloodied).*** For 1 minute, the sphinx�s Speed and flying speed are doubled, opportunity attacks against it are made with disadvantage, and it can attack three times with its claw (instead of twice) when it uses Multiattack.

***Planar Jaunt (1/Day).*** The sphinx targets up to eight creatures it can see within 300 feet. The targets are magically transported to a different place, plane of existence, demiplane, or time. This effect ends after one hour or when the sphinx takes a bonus action to end it. When the effect ends, the creatures reappear in their original locations, along with any items they acquired on their jaunt. While the effect lasts, the sphinx can communicate telepathically with the targets. The sphinx chooses one of the following destinations:

***Different Location or Plane of Existence.*** The creatures appear in empty spaces of the sphinx�s choice anywhere on the Material Plane or on a different plane altogether.

***Demiplane.*** The creatures appear in empty spaces of the sphinx�s choice on a demiplane. The demiplane can be up to one square mile in size. The demiplane can appear to be inside, outside, or underground, and can contain terrain, nonmagical objects, and magical effects of the sphinx�s choosing. The sphinx may populate it with creatures and hazards with a total Challenge Rating equal to or less than the sphinx�s Challenge Rating.

***Time.*** The creatures appear in empty spaces of the sphinx�s choosing anywhere on the Material Plane, at any time from 1,000 years in the past to 1,000 years in the future. At the Narrator�s discretion, changes made in the past may alter the present.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The sphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Slow Time.*** The sphinx targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is slowed until the end of its next turn.

***Claw (Costs 2 Actions).*** The sphinx attacks with its claw.

***Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).*** The sphinx magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

#### Combat

The sphinx uses Planar Jaunt to banish its foes if it can. Otherwise, it uses its action to cast *flame strike* on the first turn of combat and then uses its claws on successive turns. It speeds time for itself as soon as it�s bloodied. With its legendary actions, the sphinx attacks with its claw if it can reach an enemy or uses Teleport if it can�t, and then uses Slow Time with its remaining legendary action each turn. The sphinx doesn�t retreat.

#### Variant: Greater Sphinx

The greater sphinx is CR 17 (18,000 XP). It is Huge and has 220 (21d12 + 84; bloodied 110) hit points. It has the following trait:

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** Each greater sphinx wears a piece of jewelry, such as a crown, headdress, or armlet. When the greater sphinx fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, its jewelry shatters. The

sphinx can create a new piece of jewelry when it finishes a long rest.

The greater sphinx has the following additional action:

***Roar (3/Day).*** The sphinx unleashes a magical roar. Each time it roars before taking a long rest, its roar becomes more powerful. Each creature within 300 feet of the sphinx that can hear it makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw with the following consequences:

***First Roar:*** A creature that fails the saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Second Roar:*** A creature that fails the saving throw takes 22 (4d10) thunder damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half damage. While frightened by this roar, the creature is paralyzed. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Third Roar:*** A creature that fails the saving throw takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half damage.

***Astounding Leap.*** The tarrasque�s high jump distance is equal to its Speed.

***Bloodied Regeneration.*** While the tarrasque is bloodied, it regains 50 hit points at the start of each of its turns. A

*wish* spell can suppress this trait for 24 hours. The tarrasque dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn�t regenerate.

***Immortal Nature.*** The tarrasque doesn�t require air, sustenance, or sleep.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

***Reflective Carapace.*** When the tarrasque is targeted by a *magic missile* spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 3, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 4 to 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the spell is reflected back, targeting the caster as if it originated from the tarrasque.

***Siege Monster.*** The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The tarrasque attacks with its bite, claw, horns, and tail. It can use Swallow instead of its bite. If it�s bloodied, it also recharges and then uses Radiant Breath.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 42 (5d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 27). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the tarrasque can�t bite a different creature.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (5d8 + 10) slashing damage.

***Horns.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 37 (5d10 + 10) piercing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (5d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it falls prone.

***Swallow.*** The tarrasque makes a bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the tarrasque, it is

blinded and restrained, and it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage and 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the tarrasque�s turns.

If a swallowed creature deals 70 or more damage to the tarrasque in a single turn, or if the tarrasque dies, the tarrasque vomits up all swallowed creatures.

***Radiant Breath (Recharge 5�6).*** The tarrasque exhales radiant energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area

makes a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, taking 105 (30d6) radiant damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Attack.*** The tarrasque attacks with its claw or tail.

***Move.*** The tarrasque moves up to half its Speed.

***Roar.*** Each creature of the tarrasque�s choice within 120 feet makes a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is in line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends on it, it is immune to the tarrasque�s Roar for 24 hours.

***Elite Recovery (While Bloodied).*** The tarrasque ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can use this action as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.

***Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).*** The tarrasque makes a bite attack or uses Swallow.

***Inescapable Earth (Costs 3 Actions).*** Each flying creature or object within 300 feet falls and its flying speed is reduced to 0 until the start of the tarrasque�s next turn.

#### Combat

The tarrasque�s preferred mode of combat is to use its multiattack and then to use a legendary action to Chomp a target. It uses its Radiant Breath, when available, on three or more creatures that have seriously hurt it. It uses its Astounding Leap and Radiant Breath (sometimes together) to deal with flying enemies. If it still can�t reach flying creatures, it uses Inescapable Earth.

When the tarrasque is first bloodied, it tries to retreat and find a new, faraway land to devastate. If pursued or prevented from escaping, it fights to the death.

***Flammable.*** If the treant takes fire damage, it catches fire, taking 10 (3d6) ongoing fire damage, unless it is already on fire. It can use an action to extinguish itself, ending the ongoing damage.

***Forest Speaker.*** The treant can communicate with beasts and plants. ***Siege Monster.*** The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The treant makes two attacks, or makes one attack and uses Animate Plant.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8

+ 6) bludgeoning damage.

***Animate Plant.*** The treant magically animates a Large or larger plant within 60 feet. The plant is immobile, but it acts on the treant�s initiative and can make a slam attack, or a rock attack if there are rocks to throw within 10 feet of it. Non-plant creatures treat the ground within 15 feet of the plant as difficult terrain, as surrounding roots conspire to trip and grasp moving creatures. The plant remains animated for 1 hour. If the treant uses this action while it has three plants animated in this way, the plant that has been animated the longest returns to normal.

## Troglodyte

Descendants of an ancient subterranean culture beset by calamity, troglodytes somewhat resemble lizardfolk, at least to the extent that grimlocks resemble humans.

#### Disease: Troglodyte Stench

A troglodyte�s bite can infect a living creature with troglodyte stench. An infected creature is poisoned and gains the following trait:

***Stench.*** A non-troglodyte other than the creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to troglodyte Stench for 24 hours.

The subject makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw every 24 hours after being infected, becoming cured on a success.

The disease can also be cured with *lesser restoration* and similar magic.

***Keen Smell.*** The troll has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.

***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn�t function on its next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn�t regenerate.

***Severed Limbs.*** If the troll is dealt a critical hit with a slashing weapon, one of its extremities is severed. The extremity has AC 15, 10 hit points, a Speed of 10, and the troll�s Regeneration trait.

As a bonus action, the troll can reattach the extremity. While the troll is missing the extremity, its maximum hit points are reduced by 10.

Roll d6 to determine the severed extremity:

**1-4: *Arm.*** If the troll has an arm, it loses an arm. It loses one of its claw attacks, and the severed arm can make a claw attack.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The troll attacks with its bite and twice with its claw.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.

#### Variant: Cave Troll

The cave troll is CR 6 (2,300 XP). It has an AC of 18 and blindsight out to a range of 120 feet. It has the following version of the Regeneration trait:

***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes radiant damage or is exposed to sunlight, this trait doesn�t function on its next turn. The troll is petrified if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn�t regenerate.

The troll has the following additional action. When the troll uses Multiattack, it can make a rock attack in place of one claw attack.

#### Variant: Scrag

The scrag has a swim speed of 30 and can breathe air and water. It has the following version of the Regeneration trait:

***Regeneration.*** The scrag regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the scrag takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn�t function on its next turn. This trait also doesn�t function if the troll hasn�t been immersed in water since the start of its last turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn�t regenerate.

If the target is a creature and the unicorn moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure.

***Grant Boon (3/Day).*** The unicorn touches a willing creature, including itself, with its horn and grants one of the following boons:

**Resolution:** The creature is immune to being charmed or frightened for 24 hours.

#### Combat

The unicorn grants a boon, such as Luck or Protection, to itself or an ally before battle. It charges into melee combat and fights with its hooves and horn.

The darkness aura lasts for 10 minutes or until the unicorn takes damage. The aura doesn�t hinder the unicorn�s sight.

**Languages** the languages it knew in life ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** When the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it visibly grows older. Its original appearance is restored when it finishes a long rest.

***Misty Recovery.*** When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can�t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this way, it can be destroyed by fire damage, radiant damage, damage from a magical weapon, or a wooden stake driven through the heart, but it is otherwise immune to damage.

***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasn�t taken radiant damage since its last turn.

***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.

***Vampire Weaknesses.*** Vampires� most common weaknesses are sunlight and running water. When the vampire ends its turn in contact with one of its weaknesses (such as being bathed in sunlight or running water), it takes 20 radiant damage. While in contact with its weakness, it can�t use its Regeneration trait or its Mist Form or Shapechange actions.

###### ACTIONS

***Grab (Vampire Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.

The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled in this way. ***Charm (Gaze).*** The vampire magically targets a creature within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. If the target has at least one level of strife, it makes this saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, the target is charmed by the vampire for 24 hours.

While charmed it regards the vampire as a trusted friend and is a willing target for the vampire�s bite. The target repeats the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target�s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to this vampire�s Charm for 24 hours.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target that is grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware of the vampire�s presence. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and the target takes 1 level of strife. The target�s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the vampire regains this number of hit points. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, it dies and rises the following night as a vampire spawn in the vampire�s thrall.

Before the target first rises as a vampire spawn, a *bless*, *gentle repose*, or similar spell cast on the body prevents this transformation.

###### REACTIONS

***Hissing Scuttle (1/Day).*** When the vampire takes radiant damage, it moves up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Warding Charm (1/Day).*** When a creature the vampire can see targets it with a melee attack but before the attack is made, the vampire uses Charm on that creature.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

time and only at the end of another creature�s turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

damage from weapons, and has advantage on saving throws and Stealth checks. It can pass through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing but can�t pass through water. Anything it�s carrying transforms with it.

***Shapechange.*** The vampire transforms into the shape of a Medium or smaller beast or back into its true form. While transformed, it has the beast�s size and movement modes. It can�t use reactions or legendary actions, and can�t speak. Otherwise, it uses the vampire�s statistics. Anything it�s carrying transforms with it.

#### Combat

The vampire grabs and bites its most vulnerable opponent. Once it has weakened a foe with a bite attack, the vampire uses its Blood Charm on that target. When reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, the vampire retreats in animal or mist form through

well-prepared escape routes, returning to take its revenge another day.

The will-o�-wisp attacks, turns invisible, and then moves to safety. On its next turn it moves to melee range, turns visible, and attacks. It repeats this pattern. The

will-o�-wisp fights only to preserve its treasure. It may retreat to summon allies or otherwise cause trouble.

## Wraiths

A wraith is an incorporeal spirit of pure hatred and malice.

**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 12

**Languages** the languages it knew in life ***Aura of Fear.*** A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of a wraith makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature�s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to any wraith�s Aura of Fear for 24 hours.

***Evil.*** The wraith radiates an Evil aura. ***Incorporeal.*** The wraith can move through creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. If it takes radiant damage, it loses this trait until the end of its next turn.

***Light Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight or bright light cast by a fire, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.

###### ACTIONS

***Life Drain.*** The wraith targets a creature within 5 feet, forcing it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes a level of strife. It also takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, or 21 (6d6) necrotic damage if it is frightened or surprised, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. It dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Create Specter.*** The wraith touches a humanoid corpse it killed less than 1 day ago. The creature�s spirit rises as a specter under the wraith�s control.

#### Combat

The wraith strikes the weakest-looking or most isolated target, phasing through a solid object to attack if possible. It stays close to its target in order to inflict fear on it, thus gaining the most from its Life Drain. Once a creature is no longer frightened by it, it flies away (taking opportunity attacks if necessary) and tries to frighten and drain another target. It flees if it takes force, radiant, or psychic damage while bloodied.

**Languages** the languages it knew in life ***Aura of Fear.*** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of a wraith lord makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened until the start of its next turn. If

a creature�s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to any wraith or wraith lord�s Aura of Fear for 24 hours.

***Evil.*** The wraith lord radiates an Evil aura. ***Incorporeal.*** The wraith lord can move through creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. If it takes radiant damage, it loses this trait until the end of its next turn.

***Light Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight or bright light cast by a fire, the wraith lord has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The wraith lord can use Paralyzing Terror. It then uses Life Drain twice. If in corporeal form, it then makes a greatsword attack.

***Life Drain.*** The wraith targets a creature within 5 feet, forcing it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes a level of strife. It also takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage, or 24 (7d6) necrotic damage if it is frightened or surprised, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. It dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Greatsword (Corporeal Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) poison damage, and the target makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is poisoned for 24 hours. While poisoned in this way, the target can�t regain hit points. If a creature dies while poisoned in this way, its spirit rises as a wraith under the wraith lord�s control 1 minute after its death.

***Paralyzing Terror.*** The wraith lord targets a frightened creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Create Wraith.*** The wraith lord touches a humanoid corpse it killed up to 1 day ago. The creature�s spirit rises as a wraith under the wraith lord�s control.

***Corporeal Form (1/Day).*** The wraith lord takes on a material form. In material form, it loses its incorporeal trait, its fly speed, and its immunity to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions. The wraith instantly reverts to its incorporeal form if it is bloodied, and it can do so voluntarily at any time as an action.

#### Combat

The wraith lord ambushes in corporeal form. It uses Paralyzing Terror on a frightened

creature, then Life Drain and its greatsword on the same target (preferably a paralyzed one). It avoids creatures in sunlight or firelight if it can. When bloodied, it becomes incorporeal and continues using Paralyzing Terror and Life Drain. It flees if reduced to 40 hit points or fewer.

## Wyvern

Sometimes referred to as false dragons, wyverns are easily differentiated from their larger, more intelligent kin by their limbs: whereas true dragons have four legs and a thick tail, the wyvern possesses only hind legs, and its whip-like tail is tipped with a poisonous stinger.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage. If the wyvern is attacking from above, the target is grappled by the wyvern (escape DC 15). While grappling a target in this way, the wyvern�s walking speed is reduced to 0, it can�t use its claws to attack any other

creature, and it has advantage on attacks against the target.

***Stinger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

#### Combat

A wyvern begins combat by attacking from above, using its claws and stinger. When bloodied, it lands and attacks with its bite and stinger. It flees only if it is blinded, poisoned, or afflicted with some other condition that reduces its combat capacity.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that was hit by the xorn�s claws at least twice this turn. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the xorn consumes one of the following nonmagical objects in the target�s possession: a worn set of metal armor or a carried metal weapon or shield, a piece of metal equipment, a gem, or up to 1,000 coins. For 1 minute after an item is consumed, a creature can retrieve it from the gullet of a willing, incapacitated, or dead xorn, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage in the process.

#### Combat

The xorn targets creatures wearing metal armor or carrying coins or gems. After attacking, it burrows to safety, risking opportunity attacks, and then emerges to attack again on its next turn. It flees if it�s bloodied and has consumed at least one item.

***Chilling Gaze (Gaze).*** One creature within 30 feet that is not immune to cold damage makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) cold damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the paralysis on a success. If a creature�s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to any Chilling Gaze for 24 hours.

#### Combat

The yeti uses its Chilling Gaze and then claws the same target. On its next turn the yeti uses Chilling Gaze and its claws against a different target, if one is available. The yeti flees if it takes fire damage while bloodied.

#### Variant: Abominable Snowman

The abominable snowman is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 4 monsters (2,200 XP). It is Huge and has 136 (16d10 + 48; bloodied 68) hit points. It has the following bonus actions, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Elite Recovery.*** The snowman ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can use this bonus action as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.

***Cold Breath.*** The snowman breathes a 30-foot cone of freezing wind. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d10) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

***Blizzard (1/Day).*** The snowman summons a magical blizzard that affects a

500-foot-radius area for 10 minutes or until the snowman dies. The area is

difficult terrain, and a creature�s visibility is reduced to 20 feet; beyond this, vision is obscured by snow. A creature in the area that doesn�t move from its space during its turn takes 7 (2d6) cold damage.

***Roar (1/Day).*** Each creature of the snowman�s choice within 120 feet that hears its roar makes a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature is frightened for 1 minute.

***Undead Fortitude (1/Day).*** If the zombie is reduced to 0 hit points by damage that isn�t radiant or from a critical hit, it�s instead reduced to 1 hit point, falls prone, and is stunned until the end of its next turn, appearing to be dead.

###### ACTIONS

***Grab.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 11). Until the grapple ends, the zombie can�t grab another target.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled target. *Hit:* 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage, and the zombie regains the same number of hit points.

#### Zombie Template

A zombified creature retains all its stats except as noted below.

***Type.*** The zombie�s type is undead. It does not require air, sustenance, or sleep. ***Ability Scores.*** The zombie�s ability scores are reduced to the following,

unless they�re already lower: Dex 6 (�2), Int 3 (�4), Wis 8 (�1), Cha 4 (�3).

***Saving Throws.*** The zombie loses all saving throw proficiencies.

***Speed.*** Any speed the creature has is reduced by 10, or to 30, whichever is lower.

***Skills.*** The zombie loses all skill proficiencies.

***Immunities.*** The zombie gains immunity to poison damage, fatigue, and the poisoned condition.

***Senses.*** The zombie gains darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet.

***Languages.*** The zombie understands the languages it knew in life but can�t speak or take any action requiring vocalization. ***Traits.*** The zombie loses all traits, but gains Undead Fortitude.

***Actions and Abilities.*** The zombie loses all spellcasting abilities and any actions that create magical effects.

***Actions.*** The zombie can gain the grab and bite attacks of the zombie if the base creature has the capability to grab and bite. If the creature has Multiattack, it can replace weapon attacks in its multiattack with a grab or bite. Both attacks use Strength for attack and damage rolls. The grab deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 for each size category above Medium. The bite deals 1d10 piercing damage plus 1d10 for each size category above Medium. The escape DC for the zombie�s grab is equal to its maneuver DC. It loses any ranged attacks that require the use of a weapon more

complex than a rock. It also loses any legendary actions and bonus actions.

#### Variants: More Zombie Traits

In place of (or in addition to) Undead Fortitude, you can give a zombie one of the following traits:

***Infectious Bite.*** A creature bitten by the zombie takes 2 (1d4) ongoing necrotic damage until it regains hit points or a creature makes a DC 15 Medicine check to treat the wound. If a beast, dragon, giant, humanoid, or monstrosity dies while suffering from this effect, it becomes a zombie after 1 minute, gaining the zombie template.

***Vile Discharge.*** The zombie�s melee attacks deal an extra 2 (1d4) poison damage. Additionally, when it�s reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes. Creatures within 5 feet make a Dexterity saving throw against the zombie�s maneuver DC, taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failure.

***Vigor Mortis.*** The zombie can take the Dash action as a bonus action. It can�t do so again until it moves 0 feet on one of its turns.

#### Ogre Zombie Variant: Ogre Flesh Heap

The ogre flesh heap is CR 4 (1,100 XP). It has the following additional reactions:

***Bodyblock.*** If the ogre flesh heap is grappling a creature when it is hit with a weapon attack by a creature it can see, it uses the creature as a shield, adding 2 to its AC against the attack. If this causes the attack to miss, the attack hits the grappled creature instead.

***Corpulent Expulsion (Recharge 6, While Bloodied).*** When it takes damage, the ogre flesh heap�s belly splits and releases a torrent of caustic gore in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in this area make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success. The flesh heap then takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.

# Nonplayer Characters

You can alter an NPC stat block in order to better represent a specific individual in your campaign. Most such changes do not require a change to the NPC�s Challenge Rating.

**Varying Heritage.** Heritage describes a creature�s innate, inherited abilities. You can add specificity to an NPC by assigning them signature following abilities and traits related to their heritage. This list is not exhaustive; most humanoid species can use an NPC stat block.

* *Dragonborn*: A dragonborn gains a breath weapon which they can use once per rest as an action. Each creature within either a 30-foot-long,

5-foot-wide line or a 15-foot cone (determined by draconic lineage) makes a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + Constitution modifier + proficiency bonus. On a failure, a creature takes acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder damage (determined by draconic lineage). The damage dealt is 3 (1d6) per point of the dragonborn�s Challenge Rating, with a minimum of 1d6 and a maximum of 6d6.

* *Dwarf*: A dwarf gains darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. Their Speed is 25 feet.
* *Elf*: An elf gains darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. They can�t be put to sleep by magic.
* *Gnome*: A gnome gains darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. They are Small and their Speed is 25 feet. They know the *minor illusion* cantrip,

using their choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as their spellcasting ability.

* *Halfling*: A halfling is Small and their Speed is 25 feet. When they roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
* *Human*: A human gains proficiency with one extra skill of their choice.
* *Orc*: An orc gains darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. When they score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, they can roll one of the weapon�s damage dice an additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
* *Planetouched*: A planetouched creature gains darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet. Once per long rest, when they would be reduced to 0 hit points, they are reduced to 1 hit point instead.

**Varying Culture.** An NPC�s culture represents the society in which they were raised or trained, and may grant new traits or abilities. This appendix includes NPC variants that add cultural features, producing such variants as orcish wildling minstrels or cosmopolitan alchemists.

While many cultures are associated with a particular heritage, any culture may include a person of any ancestry. For instance, a dragonborn may have been raised among shadow elves and have been trained as a shadow elf mage.

**Varying Spells and Equipment.** You can swap an NPC�s weapons or armor for others with which they are likely to be proficient. For spellcasting NPCs, you can swap out a spell for another spell of the same level on a spell list available to the NPC. If such a change increases a NPC�s

Armor Class by 4 or more, or allows them to increase their maximum possible damage on one turn by 20 percent or more, then increase the monster�s Challenge Rating by one step (for instance, from 1/8 to 1/4 or from 5 to 6).

***Unholy Star (7th-Level; V, S).*** A meteor explodes at a point the blademaster can

The effects of a sphere reach around corners.

***Fire Bolt (Cantrip; V, S).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d10) fire damage.

***Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level; V, S, M).*** A bolt of lightning 5 feet wide and 100 feet long arcs from the archmage. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

***Confusion (4th-Level; V, S, M, Concentration).*** Each creature within 10 feet of a point the archmage can see within 120 feet makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, becoming rattled until the end of its next turn on a success. On a failure, a creature is confused for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. ***Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S, M).*** Frost blasts from the archmage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

***Mislead (5th-Level; S, Concentration).*** The archmage becomes invisible for 1 hour. At the same time, an illusory copy of the archmage appears in their space. The archmage can use an action to move the copy up to 60 feet and have it speak or gesture. The copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction, as solid objects and creatures pass through it. The archmage can use a bonus action to switch between their copy�s senses or their own; while using their copy�s senses, the archmage�s body is blind and deaf.

The invisibility, but not the duplicate, ends if the archmage casts another spell.

##### Globe of Invulnerability (6th-Level; V, S, M, Concentration). A glimmering,

10-foot-radius sphere appears around the archmage. It remains for 1 minute and doesn�t move with the archmage. Any

5th-level or lower spell cast from outside the sphere can�t affect anything inside the sphere, even if cast with a higher level spell slot. Targeting something inside the sphere or including the sphere�s space in an area has no effect on anything inside. ***Teleport (7th-Level; V).*** The archmage teleports to a location they are familiar with on the same plane of existence.

###### REACTIONS

***Counterspell (3rd-Level; S).*** When a creature the archmage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the archmage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the archmage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spell�s level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the archmage casts *counterspell* with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of *counterspell*.

***Shield (1st-Level; V, S).*** When the archmage is hit by an attack or targeted by *magic missile*, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to *magic missile.*

These benefits last until the start of their next turn.

Targets shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on saving throws. Attacks made against a target have disadvantage. When a fiend or undead hits a target, the aura erupts into blinding light, forcing the attacker to succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends (up to 1 minute).

***Mass Heal (9th-Level; V, S).*** Healing energy erupts from the archpriest and restores up to 700 hit points amongst any number of creatures within 60 feet that are not constructs or undead. Creatures healed in this way are also cured of any diseases, and any effect causing them to be blinded or deafened. In addition, on subsequent turns within the next minute the archpriest can use a bonus action to distribute any unused hit points.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

* Fewer than 30 hit points: stunned, blinded, and deafened for 1 hour.
* Fewer than 20 hit points: instantly killed outright.

and for 24 hours it is unable to return to the archpriest�s current plane by any means less powerful than a *wish* spell. Such a creature does not suffer this effect if it is already on its plane of origin. The archpriest can�t cast this spell and a

1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.

## Squad Template

You can treat a group of 5 to 10 identical NPCs or other monsters as a single creature by applying the Squad template to the base creature�s stat block. This allows high-level characters to battle large numbers of enemies without bogging down the game in dozens of die rolls each turn.

The squad template is best used on intelligent, organized creatures with a Challenge Rating 3 or lower that are size Small or larger. Creatures with short, simple stat blocks make the best squads.

Depending on the nature and organization of the creatures, the squad may be called a unit, squad, or horde of creatures.

A squad retains all the statistics of one of its members except as noted below.

*Size.* The squad�s Size increases by two categories.

*Type.* The squad�s new type is �group of [the original creature�s size and type].�

*Challenge Rating.* You can recalculate the squad�s CR using the information in Appendix C: Designing Monsters, or you can use the following shortcut: new CR = (old CR x 4) + 2, rounded up. An altered Challenge Rating may cause the squad�s Proficiency Bonus to change as well.

*HP.* The squad�s hit points, bloodied hit points, and number of hit dice are multiplied by 5.

*Traits.* The squad gains the following traits:

***Area Vulnerability.*** The squad takes double damage from any effect that targets an area.

***Squad Dispersal.*** When the squad is reduced to 0 hit points, it turns into 2 (1d4) base creatures, each of which are bloodied.

***Squad.*** The squad is composed of 5 or more creatures. If it is subjected to a spell, attack, or other effect that affects only one target, it takes any damage but ignores other effects. It can share its space with Medium or smaller creatures or objects. The squad can move through any

opening large enough for one base creature without squeezing.

*Damage and Healing.* Any action or trait that deals damage deals five times the usual damage, or half that if the squad is bloodied. Any action or trait that restores hit points restores five times the usual hit points, or half that if the squad is bloodied.
