## Constructed (Heritage)

### Constructed Traits

Characters with constructed heritage share a variety of traits in common.

***Age*.** Constructed do not age, many beginning life fully physically mature. With proper maintenance they can be immortal.

***Size*.** Constructed are engineered from metal, hardwood, and other dense (often expensive) materials that make them heavy, most weighing between 175 and 400 pounds and standing anywhere from 3 to 7 feet tall. Your size is Small or Medium.

***Speed*.** Your Speed is 25 feet.

***Constructed Nature.*** You are resistant to poison damage and gain one of the following benefits.

* You don't require air.
* You gain an expertise die on saving throws made to avoid being charmed or frightened.

***Mechanical Metabolism.*** Certain types of healing are less effective or even wholly ineffective. Sources of nonmagical healing other than taking a rest have no effect.

Magical healing only restores half as many hit points as normal unless you are also repaired in the same round (with an Engineering check, the *mending* cantrip, or similar).

In addition, you don’t require Supply in the typical sense; instead of eating food, you rely on a specific substance to refuel. Every 24 hours without the substance you suffer a level of fatigue and strife as your inner machinations begin to decay. Select one of the following.

* *Combustibles:* 1 pound of coal or hemp, or 2 pounds of wood.
* *Darkness:* 2 hours of complete darkness.
* *Liquid:* 1 flask of lamp oil, grease, or an alchemical liquid of your choice.
* *Metal:* 1 pound of copper or roughly 50 copper pieces. The Narrator may also allow you to consume silver,

gold, or other precious metal in an amount of equivalent worth instead.

* *Sunlight:* 3 hours of full sunlight or 6 hours of partial (shaded or cloudy) sunlight.

***Mechanical Lift.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and you can carry a number of additional bulky items equal to your proficiency bonus.

***Planar Energy.*** Choose the type of planarite that serves as your primary life force from the following list: air, death, earth, fire, life, space, time, water. You gain resistance to a specific damage type based on this source.

Regardless of planarite type, the planar energy contained within allows you to forgo sleep. When you take a long rest, you spend 4 hours in a state of inactivity (instead of sleeping for 6 hours). While powered down in this way, you suffer no penalty to passive Perception. A long rest remains 8 hours for you as normal, and the remainder of the time must be filled only with light activity.

### Constructed Gifts

In addition to the traits found in your constructed heritage, choose one of the following frames as your heritage gift.

***Cross-Functional.*** With the Narrator’s permission, you can choose an augment trait from a different frame instead of an augment trait for your chosen frame.

#### Military Frame

***Battle Readiness.*** Your Speed increases to 30 feet and you are proficient with clubs, spears, and light crossbows.

In addition, you have a melee weapon built into one of your arms that is immediately swapped out for a hand when sheathed. Choose one melee weapon that does not have the heavy, two-handed, or versatile property. When attached in this way, you are proficient with the weapon, it cannot be thrown, and you cannot be disarmed of it. The weapon can be replaced with another weapon with 10 minutes of work and a DC 13 Engineering or tinker’s tools check.

***Military Augments.*** Choose two of the following customizations to enhance your military frame.

* *Cavalry:* Your Speed increases by 5 feet, and you are proficient with land vehicles.
* *Heavy Artillery:* You have a pop-up shoulder cannon that functions as the *acid splash, fire bolt,* or *ray of frost* cantrip (chosen when you select this customization and using your highest ability score as its spellcasting ability) but its effects are nonmagical.
* *Infantry:* You have a crawl speed equal to your Speed.
* *Light Artillery:* You replace one hand with a hand crossbow. You are proficient with the weapon and can ignore its loading property.
* *Navy:* You have a swim speed of 20 feet and proficiency with water vehicles.

#### Service Frame

***Social Grace.*** You are proficient in Deception and Insight.

***Service Augments.*** Choose two of the following customizations.

* *Anticipatory Nimbleness:* You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
* *Knowledge Archive:* When you become proficient in your first lore skill (Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, Religion; as bonus knowledge), you gain two of its skill specialties.
* *Mathematical Mnemonics:* You are proficient in Engineering, its *mathematics* skill specialty, and you know the *calculate* cantrip and can cast it without the need for components.

For holding, grasping, and using objects, you can use a bonus action to swap your extension out for an articulated hand. While not wielding a shield, you can use your arm to wield a weapon with properties that would normally require two hands (loading,

two-handed) or if wielding a versatile weapon to be treated as wielding it two handed. Choose one of the following.

* *Arc Welder Extension:* This extension functions as the *shocking grasp* cantrip (using your highest ability score as its spellcasting ability) but its effects are nonmagical.
* *Flamethrower Extension:* This extension functions as the *produce flame* cantrip (using your highest ability score as its spellcasting ability) but its effects are nonmagical.
* *Multi-Tool Extension:* You are proficient with and can deploy built-in navigator’s tools, thieves’ tools, and tinker’s tools with this extension.

Utility Augments.

### Artificial Spellcasting

Artificers are able to harness magic through technology. See Chapter 11: Spellcasting in the *Adventurer’s Guide* for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Artificer spell list.

#### Spell Inventions

Whenever you prepare an artificer spell, you create a spell invention for that spell using your tools of artifice and whatever materials you have on hand.

A spell invention is a unique experimental device that is esoteric and useless to other creatures, but in your hands can be used to cast the spell it was prepared for. You prepare a number of spells with a spell level no higher than your maximum spell level (both as shown on the Artificer table) chosen from the artificer spell list.

You can change your list of prepared spells and replace or create new spell inventions whenever you finish a long rest by spending at least 10 minutes tinkering and experimenting with 1 gold worth of materials per new spell invention (in addition to any material components the

spell requires). Any spell inventions you’ve prepared previously are taken apart and integrated into the new ones, or fall apart due to a lack of maintenance.

You can only have a maximum of 1 spell invention per spell you have prepared. You do not have spell slots, and instead utilize your spell inventions to cast spells. Whenever you cast a prepared artificer spell using a spell invention, you may cast it at a spell slot level up to your maximum spell level as shown on the Artificer table. You may freely draw a spell invention from your inventory as part of the same action used to cast a spell through it, and you may also freely stow any spell inventions you were already wielding using that same action.

Using a spell invention does not remove its spell from your list of prepared spells.

You can determine the exact form a spell invention takes but it weighs 1 pound per spell level, is no longer than 1 foot in any dimension, and it must be wielded in at least one hand to be used (treat cantrips as 1st-level spells). A spell invention has an AC equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier, and a number of hit points equal to your artificer level × 2. You can fully repair your spell inventions whenever you finish a long rest, so long as you have access to your tools of artifice.

***Fizzle Die.*** After you cast a spell using a spell invention, you must roll a fizzle die, a 1d4. If the result is less than or equal to the spell slot level used to cast the spell, your spell invention burns out, runs out of power, or otherwise malfunctions and cannot be used again until repaired. Your fizzle die improves by one step at 10th level (from 1d4 to 1d6) and again at 20th level (from 1d6 to 1d8), and it improves by one step when using a spell invention gained from your artificer archetype (maximum 1d10).

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list and

construct a spell invention for each. Unlike your other spell inventions, using these does not require rolling a fizzle die. You learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice at higher levels and construct spell inventions for them, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one, and for setting the saving throw DC of an artificer feature.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Scientific Ritual Casting

You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual using a spell invention if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. When using a spell invention in this way, you do not have to roll the fizzle die.

#### Tools of Artifice

You produce your spell inventions and infuse items using your tools which act as your spellcasting focus. These tools can be a sewing kit, smith’s tools, thieves’ tools, or any sort of artisan’s tools. After you gain the ability to infuse items at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as tools of artifice. You must be proficient with the tools you use in this way.

### Craftsman

Artificers often start out in creative or artistic trades. You gain an expertise die on Engineering checks, and on artisan's tools checks and smith’s tools checks made to create items or make repairs.

### Tactical Chemistry

At 1st level, as a bonus action, you can create one of the following items:

* acid (vial)
* alchemist’s fire
* black powder charge
* ether (flask)
* flash bomb
* oil (1 pint flask)
* paint pot
* poison (basic)
* smoke bomb
* tanglefoot bag
* torch
* torch (alchemical)

Items you make in this way are extremely unstable and must be used immediately. If an item you created in this way is not used (activated, lit, thrown, or applied as appropriate to the item) by the end of your next turn it dissolves into useless sludge.

You can use this feature to create a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. You cannot regain expended uses in this way if you don’t have access to tools of artifice.

### Schematics

Starting at 2nd level, you can build all manner of things with the right tools, materials, and most importantly the schematics of what you’re trying to make.

#### Schematic Book

You gain schematics for three common rarity magic items of your choice (see Chapter 9: Enchanted Gear in *Trials & Treasures*). A schematic is a collection of

notes and diagrams that explains in detail how to create a specific magic item.

These form your schematic book, and any future schematics you gain are added to it.

#### Crafting With Schematics

When you have the schematics for a magic item, they gain advantage on crafting checks to make it and the time required for crafting it is halved. Crafting a magic item using a schematic does not use up the schematic in any way, and the schematic remains usable. In addition, while using a schematic the quality of a mundane item required to make a magic item is reduced by one step.

#### Creating New Schematics

You can attempt to create and add a new schematic to your schematic book by spending 1 hour studying a magic item and gold equal to 1/10th of that item’s cost in experiments and material tests. At the end of the hour make an Engineering check (DC equal to item’s crafting DC).

On a success you create a new schematic of that magic item and add it to your schematic book, and on a failure the time and materials are wasted.

Alternatively, if you find a schematic for a magic item you can add it to your schematic book.

To add a schematic to your schematic book or to create a schematic of a magic item, you must meet the minimum level requirements as if you were crafting the item (as shown on the Crafting and Minimum Player Level table in Chapter 8: Enchanted Gear of *Trials & Treasures*).

#### Replacing Your Schematic Book

The knowledge in your schematic book is too complex to keep entirely memorized, and if it is destroyed or lost you can’t reproduce it. For this reason most artificers fiercely protect their schematic books and many write copies. You can

copy a schematic from your own schematic book into another book. This is just like creating a new schematic only significantly faster and easier since you already understand your own notations. You need only spend 10 minutes and 1 gold for each of your own schematics you copy into another book, or to create new schematics for a magic item you currently have infused.

#### Infusion

Once you have sufficiently studied a magic item you can reproduce and temporarily infuse its magical properties into items through arcano-technical ingenuity.

If you have the schematic for a magic item, you can use an action to infuse it, turning a mundane item into the magic item from your schematic.

An infusion only works on mundane items specific to the type of magic item. For example, an infusion using a schematic for a magic longsword can only be used on a nonmagical longsword, and an infusion using a schematic for a suit of light armor can only be used on a nonmagical suit of padded cloth or padded leather. Many magic items take the form of small trinkets, baubles, and gems that can often be interchangeable, but the infused item needs to only be similar to the magic item’s description.

The Narrator determines whether or not an item is suitable for an infusion.

You can infuse a number of items as shown on the Infusion Limit column of the Artificer table. You regain all expended infusion uses whenever you finish a long rest.

If an infused item requires attunement, you can attune yourself or another willing creature to it when you infuse the item. If you or another creature decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement.

Any infusions you imbue vanish after you finish a long rest, but they can remain imbued indefinitely if you commit to

regular upkeep. Whenever you finish a long rest you can maintain any infused items you have access to by expending one infusion use for each. Any infusions you fail to maintain vanish and revert to mundane items.

### Field Discoveries

Experimentation is the key to scientific progress, and through your experiences and findings in the field you’ve discovered new skills and data. At 2nd level you gain one field discovery of your choice. Field discoveries are detailed at the end of the class description. The Field Discoveries column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more field discoveries. Unless otherwise noted, you can gain each field discovery only once.

### Artificer Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose a field of study and technological specialty. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 9th, and 15th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or increase two ability scores of your choice 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Omnitools

With a bit of arcane power and a lot of overengineering, your tools fold and flip into whatever you need them to be. Also at 4th level, you can use your tools of artifice as if they were any kind of artisan’s tools or miscellaneous tool kits. This ability does not grant you proficiency in those tool sets but you can make tool checks as if you had those tools.

### Battlefield Smithing

At 6th level, as a veteran combat-tinkerer you specialize in certain aspects of warfare. Choose one of the following.

#### Armor Smithing

You have advantage on checks made to maintain and repair armor, and you are always considered to have access to a forge when repairing armor.

In addition, during a short rest you can spend 25 gold in materials to permanently add one of the following modifications to a suit of nonmagical armor or change an additional modification: camouflaged, flamboyant, spiked, stealthy, storage. A suit of armor can only have one additional modification.

#### Caravan Smithing

You have advantage on checks made to repair vehicles, and you are always considered to have access to a forge when repairing a vehicle.

In addition, during a short rest you can either repair any malfunction a vehicle is suffering or restore up to 50 of the vehicle’s hit points at the cost of 25 gold in materials.

#### Weapon Smithing

You have advantage on checks made to maintain and repair weapons, and you are always considered to have access to a forge when repairing a weapon.

In addition, during a short rest you can spend 25 gold in materials to permanently add one of the following modifications to a nonmagical weapon or change an additional modification: flamboyant, quickdraw, rebounding (thrown weapons only), stealthy, storage. A weapon can only have one additional modification.

### Intellectual Calibre

At 7th level, your attitudes and academic manners have cemented how you and your intellect are perceived by your peers.

Choose one of the following.

#### Kooky Eccentric

Your excitement for your work is infectious and most find your quirky methodology inescapably endearing. You gain proficiency in Persuasion, or if you are already proficient in Persuasion you gain an expertise die instead. In addition, you can always choose to use Intelligence when making a Persuasion check.

#### Sporadic Genius

You’re known for sudden bursts of insight and people listen to your fervorous insights. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Stern Proctor

Your demand for perfection extends past your own work, and with only a discerning glare and a few choice words you can make the confident seem foolish. You gain proficiency in Intimidation, or if you are already proficient in Intimidation you gain an expertise die instead. In addition, you can always choose to use Intelligence when making an Intimidation check.

### Advanced Tactical Chemistry

At 9th level you may add your Intelligence modifier to the saving throw DC of any item you create using Tactical Chemistry. In addition, choose one of the following:

#### Humanoid Biochemistry

You can create the following additional items using your Tactical Chemistry feature:

* antitoxin
* *healing potion (greater)*
* laudanum

#### Toxin Synthesis

You can create the following additional items using your Tactical Chemistry feature:

* curare (vial)
* poison, potent (vial)

### Trinket Master

At 10th level, whenever you craft a magic item that has a gold cost of 50 or less, the crafting time is reduced to a long rest (this time cannot be further reduced by any features or traits).

### Reliable Spell Inventions

At 11th level, whenever you roll a 1 on the fizzle die, you may reroll it, if you do you must use the new result.

In addition, your spell inventions have become streamlined enough that other creatures can make sense of them. A creature holding one of your spell inventions can use an action to make an Engineering check (DC equal to your spell save DC). On a success the spell is cast at its lowest possible spell level, or on a failure the spell fizzles out and fails to cast. Whenever a creature attempts to cast a spell using one of your spell inventions in this way, roll the fizzle die as normal.

### Marvel of Innovation

At 13th level, when you first gain this feature, choose a type of artisan’s tools you are proficient with and a newly invented foodstuff, object, or trade good that could conceivably be crafted using those tools.

For example, using brewer’s supplies you

could invent carbonated sodas, using glassblower’s tools you could invent glowing iridium glassware, or using jeweler’s tools you could invent a fine mechanism for better performing pocket watches.

Whenever you use your chosen tools to create trade goods, you can instead create your new invention as a trade good. Your new invention has a value equal to 5 times the value of normal trade goods created using those tools as shown on the Artisan’s Tools and Profession Checks table on page 338 of the *Adventurer’s Guide*.

Any other uses your invention may have are at the Narrator’s discretion, but its utility shouldn’t exceed that of other mundane adventuring gear.

In addition, your notoriety as a great inventor spreads along with your invention. While you are in a region you’ve sold your invention in, you have advantage on prestige checks.

### Technological Attunement

At 14th level you’ve managed to bypass many of the arcane roadblocks regarding magic item attunement through the clever use of technology.

* + You can attune to up to 5 magic items at once.
  + You ignore all heritage, culture, class, level, and alignment requirements when attuning to or using a magic item.

### Hotfixer

At 17th level, when rolling the fizzle die would burn out one of your spell inventions, you can use your reaction to fix it and restore it to full working order. Once you repair a spell invention in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Infusion Recharge

At 18th level, while you are attuned to a magic item that uses charges, you can use a bonus action to expend one infusion use

and restore up to 1d6 of that item’s spent charges.

### Magical Automaton

At 20th level, whenever you create a spell invention, you may spend 25 additional gp in material components and expend two uses of your infusion feature to transform that spell invention into a spell automaton that uses the spell automaton stat block and it is destroyed if it reaches 0 hit points.

The exact design of your spell automaton is up to you, and it may resemble a humanoid creature, a boxy contraption, or be a magical construct flowing with arcane energies.

Your spell automaton is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

You can maintain this spell automaton as if it was an infused item, requiring both the prepared spell invention and two uses of your infusion feature. You can repair your spell automaton to full hit points during a long rest so long as you have access to your tools of artifice. You can only maintain a single spell automaton at a time, and if you attempt to create a second spell automaton or fail to maintain one after finishing a long rest the spell automaton falls apart into scrap.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* its creator’s spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2d10 + 4 + your Intelligence modifier bludgeoning damage.

***Integrated Spell.*** The automaton uses the spell invention integrated into it to cast a spell, using your spell attack bonus and spell save DC. If the spell invention integrated into it would burn out due to the result of the fizzle die, the automaton takes 30 damage instead.

#### BONUS ACTIONS

***Overclock (Recharge 5–6).*** The automaton takes the Dash action.

## Field Discoveries

When you gain access to a new field discovery, choose one of the following.

### A Better Mousetrap

You can improve fishing traps, hunting snares, and hunting traps as you set them. Hunting traps you improve in this way are always considered masterwork hunting traps. Whenever you retrieve an improved fishing trap or hunting snare, you may add a d6 to the result determining how much Supply has been captured.

### Alchemical Prodigy

When you first gain this field discovery, you gain two schematics of your choice and add them to your schematic book. These schematics must be for potions of common or uncommon rarity. You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies, or if you are already proficient you gain an expertise die

instead. In addition, you have advantage on checks made to create schematics for potions.

### Golden Ratio

When you select this field discovery you may select two 1st-level spells from the druid spell list. These are considered artificer spells for you and you may add them to the list of spells you can prepare. If you are at least a 7th level artificer when you select this field discovery, you may select 1st- or 2nd-level spells from the druid spell list instead. You may select this field discovery multiple times, choosing different druid spells each time.

### Modern Comforts

Whenever you begin a long rest that would incur the penalties of roughing it (such as resting without heat in a cold environment, on unlevel rocky terrain, or without protection from pests in swampy environments) you may repurpose one of your currently prepared spell inventions. If you do, you do not suffer the penalties of roughing it during that long rest. You can determine the exact nature of this repurposed spell invention (some examples include using a *burning hands* spell invention as a space heater or a *shocking grasp* spell invention as a bug zapper).

### Orienteering

With 1 minute’s work you can cobble together a makeshift compass. Compasses made in this way become useless after 1 hour and have no sale value. You also gain an expertise die on checks made for the Chronicle journey activity. In addition, you gain proficiency in Survival and its *wayfinding* skill specialty. If you already have this skill specialty you instead gain a Survival skill specialty of your choice.

### Reengineering Nature

You may use Engineering in place of Survival when setting up camp or performing the Gather Components journey activity. In addition, you may use the material components gained from the Gather Components journey activity for your spell inventions and other artificer features that require material components.

### Retraced Development

With 1 hour of work you can create ramshackle versions of any type of artisan’s tools out of wood and stone. You take a –2 penalty on checks made with these ramshackle tools, only you can make use of them, and they have no sale value, but you can use them just like normal versions of those tools and they can also be used as tools of artifice.

### Rope and Pulley Master

By spending 10 minutes working with at least 300 feet of rope, you can create the following through ingenious use of ropes and pulleys.

* + A rope system that provides safe travel over a gap of 50 feet or less. You must be able to access both sides of this gap to create a rope system in this way.
  + A rope system that allows a creature to lift an object of a weight up to 5 × its carrying capacity directly up as far as 50 feet.
  + A rope system that allows a creature to drag an object of a weight up to 5 × its carrying capacity as far as 50 feet.
  + A manual rope elevator that allows a single Medium-sized or smaller creature to travel up to 50 feet straight up and down as if it were difficult terrain (a tree, cliff wall, ceiling, or similar structure is required at the top of this elevator for the ropes to attach).

You can also deconstruct and recover the rope used in any of these rope

creations by spending 10 minutes tearing it down.

### Strategic Dismantling

You gain the Engineering skill specialty *mechanical traps*. In addition, if you trigger a trap while attempting to disarm it, you gain advantage on any saving throws made to avoid it.

### Tinker Toys

Your mastery of locomotion and gearing allows you to easily infuse elements of motion into simple devices. As an action you can create and place a Tiny moving gadget called a tinker toy (such as a walking doll, flying whirligig, or toy boat) out of 1 gold worth of materials. This tinker toy has AC 10, 1 hit point, and your choice of a Speed of 10 feet, fly speed of 10 feet, or swim speed of 10 feet. When you place this device it begins moving in a straight line until it is destroyed, it is blocked by an obstacle, or you use a bonus action to pick it up again. Tinker toys made in this way weigh 2 pounds, and can carry up to 1 pound worth of other devices or materials.

Once you create a tinker toy in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest, and any existing tinker toys you’ve created fall apart whenever you create a new one.

## Artificer Archetypes

Science has countless branching paths to take—every artificer has their own specialties and unique understanding of the universe, its physical laws, and how those laws can be broken. At 3rd level select one of the following artificer archetypes.

### Bombardier

#### Alchemical Grenades

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with a special type of rare ranged weapon called an alchemical

grenade, and you may use your Intelligence when making attack and damage rolls with them.

You can use a bonus action to arm an alchemical grenade. An armed alchemical grenade explodes when it hits a target or at the end of your turn.

Alchemical grenades are thrown weapons with a range of 20/60 feet, and when an armed alchemical grenade hits a target it deals 1d6 force damage. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level (maximum 4d6). Whenever you hit a target with an alchemical grenade, each creature within 5 feet of the target makes a Dexterity saving throw or takes half as much damage as taken by the target (the target is immune to this effect). Whenever you miss with an armed alchemical grenade it explodes in a harmless location at the end of your turn.

You can use this feature to arm a number of alchemical grenades equal to your proficiency bonus. Creating these alchemical grenades has no material costs. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest by mixing chemicals and soldering together new shells for later use. You cannot regain expended uses in this way if you don’t have access to tools of artifice.

Whenever you arm an alchemical grenade, you may select one of the following grenade types.

#### Acid Core

A target hit by this grenade takes an additional 1d4 ongoing acid damage that persists until it submerges itself in water or uses an action to wipe the acid off. This ongoing acid damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level (maximum 4d4).

#### Arcane Payload

To select this grenade type, you must expend an infusion use.

A target hit by this grenade takes an additional 1d12 force damage and makes

an Intelligence saving throw or is rattled until the end of its next turn. This additional force damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level (maximum 4d12).

#### Combustible

A target hit by this grenade takes 1d6 additional fire damage. This additional fire damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level (maximum 4d6). Flammable objects within 5 feet of the target that aren’t being worn or carried ignite, taking 1d6 ongoing fire damage until a creature uses an action to smother the flames.

#### Flashbang

A target hit by this grenade makes a Constitution saving throw or is blinded until the end of its next turn.

#### Bombardier Spells

Starting at 3rd level, when you prepare your artificer spells you can prepare certain spells and create spell inventions for them in addition to your normal number of prepared spells. These spells count as artificer spells for you, even if they aren’t on the artificer spell list.

**TABLE: BOMBARDIER SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **ARTIFICER LEVEL** | **SPELL** |
| 3rd | *earth barrier, fog cloud* |
| 5th | *seed bomb, shattering barrage* |
| 9th | *fireball, stinking cloud* |
| 13th | *fabricate, stoneskin* |
| 17th | *cloudkill, flame strike* |

#### Explosives Specialist

Also at 3rd level you gain the Engineering skill specialty *explosives*. If you already have this specialty you instead gain a different Engineering skill specialty of your choice.

#### Munitions Expert

Starting at 5th level, you can modify ammunition to create special ammunition. In a careful process that takes 10 minutes, you can modify up to 10 pieces of ammunition into your choice of explosive, flaming, or punching ammunition. It costs 5 gold in materials per piece of ammunition modified in this way.

In addition, you may use your Intelligence when making attack and damage rolls using siege weaponry.

#### Precision Explosives

At 9th level you learn the fine art of causing explosions when you *mean* to cause explosions. Whenever you arm an alchemical grenade or use Tactical Chemistry to create an alchemist’s fire, black powder charge, smoke bomb, or tanglefoot bag, you can use an action to set it in an unoccupied space in one of the following ways.

***Set Trigger.*** You attach the item to an object or surface and choose a specific mechanical action that triggers it, such as an attached chest being opened, or the wheels of an attached wagon turning.

When triggered the item explodes and its effects occur.

***Timed Explosion.*** When setting this item you choose an amount of time up to 1 hour. The item explodes and its effects occur at the chosen time.

***Vibration Sensitive.*** After this item is set, it explodes and its effects occur the next time a Small-sized or larger object or creature other than you moves within 5 feet of it.

If an item set using this feature is normally thrown, any creature within 5 feet of it when

it explodes is treated as if it were hit by the item. If an item set in this way normally has an area of effect, that area is centered where the item was set.

You may also set alchemist’s fires, black powder charges, smoke bombs, and tanglefoot bags not created using Tactical Chemistry at the cost of 5 gold in materials per item set in this way.

#### Demolitions Master

At 15th level you gain the following benefits.

* You gain resistance to fire and force damage, and immunity to the deafened condition.
* You may simultaneously set up to a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus when using Precision Explosives. Items set in this way always explode simultaneously.
* Your alchemical grenades and items made using Tactical Chemistry deal twice as much damage to objects and vehicles.

### Engineer

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with air vehicles, land vehicles, and water vehicles. If you already had any of these proficiencies you gain an expertise die with that type of vehicle instead.

#### Custom Vehicle

At 3rd level you gain the ability to create your own custom personal vehicle. Your custom vehicle is a land vehicle with statistics as shown on Table: Engineer’s vehicle.

You can create this custom vehicle over the course of 8 hours of uninterrupted work. This vehicle is unique and its exact appearance is up to you. Your custom vehicle requires your regular care, and if you attempt to create another vehicle using this feature any vehicles you’ve previously

constructed in this way fall apart into useless scrap. So long as you have access to your tools of artifice, you can restore your custom vehicle to full hit points and remove any malfunctions during a long rest.

For more detailed information regarding vehicles, see Chapter 4: Equipment in the *Adventurer’s Guide*.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can make modifications to your custom vehicle by expending infusion uses. These modifications only remain functional due to your infusions, and you can maintain these modifications as if they were infused items. Any modifications you fail to maintain are removed whenever you finish a long rest.

You can install any of the following modifications at the cost of 1 infusion each.

**TABLE: ENGINEER’S VEHICLE**

\* The damage caused by collisions with Medium vehicles is 2d6.

inventions are destroyed if your custom vehicle is destroyed.

#### Armor Plating

Your custom vehicle’s AC increases by 2.

#### All-Terrain

Your custom vehicle ignores difficult terrain.

#### Chemical Boosters

While driving your vehicle, you can use a bonus action to increase its speed by 30 feet for 1 minute. Once the vehicle’s speed is increased in this way it cannot benefit from this modification again until you finish a long rest maintaining or reinstalling this modification.

#### Enhanced Brakes

Your custom vehicle can take the Stop action even if it has momentum. When it stops in this way it loses momentum.

#### Integrated Spell Invention

When you prepare your spell inventions and modifications to your custom vehicle, you may choose to integrate a spell invention into it. You may only cast spells using integrated spell inventions while you are driving your custom vehicle. If an integrated spell invention would burn out and be destroyed, instead your custom vehicle suffers the integrity malfunction (the integrity malfunction can be suffered multiple times). Any integrated spell

#### Mechanical Legs

Your custom vehicle gains a climb speed of 30 feet or 3 miles per hour.

#### Motorized Wheels

Your custom vehicle’s Speed increases to 50 feet or 5 miles per hour.

#### Passenger Seat

Your custom vehicle loses its personal property. It can carry you plus one Medium-sized or smaller passenger.

#### Ramming

Whenever a collision occurs with your custom vehicle, the damage it takes is reduced by 1d6, and damage dealt to other impacted objects and vehicles is increased by 2d6.

#### Seaworthy

Your custom vehicle becomes a water vehicle (with a swim speed of 30 feet or 3 miles per hour) in addition to being a land vehicle. When making checks for your custom vehicle, treat it as a water vehicle while it travels over water and as a land vehicle when it travels overland.

#### Shielded Cockpit

While driving your custom vehicle, you gain the benefits of half cover.

#### Engineer Spells

Also at 3rd level, when you prepare your artificer spells you can prepare certain spells and create spell inventions for them (or forgo them for modifications to your custom vehicle) in addition to your normal number of prepared spells. These spells count as artificer spells for you, even if they aren’t on the artificer spell list.

**TABLE: ENGINEER SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **ARTIFICER LEVEL** | **SPELL** |
| 3rd | *expeditious retreat, grease* |
| 5th | *heat metal, levitate* |

| 13th | *freedom of* |
|  | *movement, stone* |
|  | *shape* |
| 17th | *animate objects,* |
|  | *creation* |

#### Pinpoint Maneuvering

Starting at 5th level, while driving a vehicle, whenever an action would allow you to change the vehicle’s facing up to 90 degrees, you may change it up to 180 degrees instead.

In addition, whenever an attack hits a vehicle you’re driving or a collision occurs involving a vehicle you are driving, you can use your reaction to avoid the worst of it, reducing the damage your vehicle would take by the result of a vehicle check (air, land, or water as appropriate to the vehicle).

#### Advanced Vehicle Modifications

At 9th level the following modifications are added to your list of modification options using your Custom Vehicle feature at the cost of two infusion uses instead of one.

#### Airborne

The vehicle becomes an air vehicle (with a fly speed of 50 feet or 5 miles per hour) in addition to being a land vehicle. When making checks for your custom vehicle, treat it as a land vehicle while it is grounded and an air vehicle while it is airborne.

#### Buzzsaws

Your custom vehicle gains inbuilt defenses in the form of motorized saws. While driving your custom vehicle you can make an attack using the saws as an action at any time during the vehicle’s movement.

They are a 2d12 weapon, they can target any creature adjacent to the vehicle, and they add your Intelligence modifier for their attack and damage rolls.

#### Enclosed Cockpit

While driving your custom vehicle, you gain the benefits of three-quarters-cover.

#### Grabbing Claws

Your custom vehicle has a pair of mechanical claws that you can attack with by using an action while driving it. You gain proficiency with the claws and may use your Intelligence when making attack and damage rolls with them. On a hit the claws deal 2d6 bludgeoning or piercing damage (chosen when you make the modification) and a creature makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to your passive Engineering score or becomes grappled. Creatures can attempt to escape this grapple as normal, using your passive Engineering score instead of your maneuver DC. Your custom vehicle’s movement is not

impeded by grappling a creature, and your vehicle may grapple a maximum of 1 creature at a time.

In addition, while driving your custom vehicle you may use the mechanical claws to lift or manipulate objects. The mechanical claws use your Intelligence to determine their carrying capacity, and when using them to make an Athletics check you may make an Engineering check instead.

#### Submersible

Your custom vehicle becomes a water vehicle (with a swim speed of 40 feet or 4 miles per hour, or an existing swim speed increased by 20 feet or 2 miles per hour) in addition to being a land vehicle. When making checks for this vehicle, treat it as a water vehicle while it travels over water and as a land vehicle when it travels overland. In addition, your custom vehicle gains the three-dimensional vehicle property when traveling in water. You and any passengers you take can breathe normally for up to 1 hour while your custom vehicle is submerged, after which it must surface or else any occupants begin to suffocate.

#### Mobile Fortress

At 15th level, whenever you make modifications to your custom vehicle, you may choose to expand it into a Huge-sized vehicle. If you do, it gains the following benefits.

* 50 additional hit points.
* Your custom vehicle can carry up to 80 Supply.
* Your custom vehicle loses the personal property and can carry up to 6 passengers in addition to you.
* In combat your custom vehicle grants you and other passengers the benefits of half cover.

### Stitcher

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the sewing kit and leatherworker’s tools. If you already had any of these proficiencies you gain an expertise die with that type of tool instead.

#### Stitcher Spells

At 3rd level, when you prepare your artificer spells you can prepare certain spells and create spell inventions for them (or forgo them for modifications) in addition to your normal number of prepared spells. These spells count as artificer spells for you, even if they aren’t on the artificer spell list.

**TABLE: STITCHER SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **ARTIFICER LEVEL** | **SPELLS** |
| 3rd | *corpse explosion, false life* |
| 5th | *gentle repose, lesser restoration* |
| 9th | *revivify, venomous succor* |
| 13th | *fabricate, private sanctum* |
| 17th | *greater restoration, raise dead* |

#### Monstrous Minion

Also at 3rd level you become able to create a monstrous minion.

You can create this monstrous minion by spending 8 hours of uninterrupted work on a humanoid corpse that has been dead no more than 24 hours. This monstrous minion is unique and its exact appearance is up to you. It follows you and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your monstrous minion won’t attack except as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take

other actions as normal and makes death saving throws. You can only have one monstrous minion at a time, and any previously created monstrous minion collapses into a corpse when you create another.

On your turn you can use a bonus action to order your monstrous minion to perform an action.

Your monstrous minion is a **zombie** (see *Monstrous Menagerie*) with the following improvements.

* Your monstrous minion’s type changes to monstrosity.
* Whenever your monstrous minion rolls initiative, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your artificer level × your proficiency bonus.
* Your monstrous minion’s Armor Class increases by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
* Your monstrous minion adds your proficiency bonus to its attack and damage rolls.
* Your monstrous minion regains all lost hit points at the end of a long rest so long as you can tend to it with leatherworker’s tools or a sewing kit.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can graft modifications onto your monstrous minion at the cost of infusion uses. These modifications only remain functional due to your infusions, and you can maintain these modifications as if they were infused items. Any modifications you fail to maintain are removed whenever you finish a long rest.

You can install any of the following modifications at the cost of 1 infusion each.

#### Exploding Bile

Your monstrous minion does not make death saving throws, and the first time it would make a death saving throw it instead explodes and is destroyed.

Creatures within 10 feet of your monstrous minion when it explodes make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 poison damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. This damage

increases by 2d6 when you reach 11th level.

#### Extra Arms

Your monstrous minion gains a climb speed of 20 feet. In addition, the maneuver DC to escape from a grapple by your monstrous minion increases by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier. You must have access to at least one additional humanoid corpse that has been dead no more than 24 hours to graft this modification.

#### Extra Legs

Your monstrous minion’s Speed increases by 15 feet. You must have access to at least one additional humanoid corpse that has been dead no more than 24 hours to graft this modification.

#### Fine Stitchwork

Your stitchwork is barely noticeable and with a heavy coat or similar accouterments your monstrous minion can pass for a living creature. When you graft this modification, make a leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit check. Creatures must make a Perception check with a DC equal to your check result to visually determine that your minion is a monstrosity.

#### Grafted Spell Invention

When you prepare your spell inventions and modifications to your monstrous minion, you may choose to graft a spell invention into the monstrous minion. You may order your monstrous minion to cast a spell using its grafted spell invention, using your spell save DC and spell attack modifier. You must roll a fizzle die as normal. Any grafted spell inventions are destroyed if the monstrous minion is destroyed.

#### Grafted Weapon

When you prepare your spell inventions and modifications to your monstrous minion, you may choose to graft a melee weapon onto one of its arms in place of a hand. The melee weapon must be able to be wielded with one hand. Your monstrous minion loses its grab attack and gains an attack with the grafted weapon, which it becomes proficient with. You may retrieve weapons grafted in this way the next time you prepare modifications for this monstrous minion by removing it, or from its remains if it is destroyed.

#### Infectious Bite

Your monstrous minion’s bite attack deals an additional 1d4 ongoing necrotic damage that persists until the target regains hit points or is medically administered to with a DC 15 Medicine check. This damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 11th level.

If the target is a beast, dragon, giant, humanoid, or monstrosity and it dies while suffering from this effect, it rises as a zombie after 1 minute, gaining the **zombie template**. Zombies created in this way are hostile to all non-undead and are not under your control.

#### Shocking Coils

Your monstrous minion has sparking coils protruding from its back. A creature takes 1d6 lightning damage when it hits your monstrous minion with a melee attack.

This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level.

#### Thicker Skin

Your monstrous minion’s Armor Class increases by 2.

#### Vigor Mortis

Your monstrous minion can take the Dash action as a bonus action. It can’t do so again until it moves 0 feet on its turn.

#### Medical Sutures

Starting at 5th level you’ve turned your arcano-science expertise towards first aid. You can create the following additional items using Tactical Chemistry:

* bandage
* healing satchel (1 use)

In addition, you can reattach a severed limb or body part. The limb or body part must be relatively intact and the injury must be no more than 8 hours old. The reattaching process takes 1 hour and requires a DC 14 leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit check. On a success the limb or body part is attached and functional with no further complications. On a failure the limb cannot be saved.

Alternatively, you can replace a lost limb or body part with a donor part. This donor part must be analogous to a missing part (an arm for an arm, a leg for a leg), and it must be from a humanoid creature of the same size. The reattaching process requires a DC 20 leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit check when performed in this way.

#### Advanced Grafting

At 9th level, the following modifications are added to your list of modification options using your Monster Minion feature at the cost of two infusion uses instead of one.

#### Dragon Gullet

You must have access to the corpse of a dragon that has been dead no more than 24 hours to graft this modification. Your monstrous minion gains the following breath weapon attack.

***Stolen Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The monster exhales the putrid and infected gullet of a fallen dragon in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 necrotic damage and 3d6 damage of the type the dragon breathed in life on a

failed saving throw, or half damage on a success.

#### Giant Muscles

You must have access to the corpse of a giant that has been dead no more than 24 hours to graft this modification. Your monstrous minion’s Strength increases by 6.

#### Grim Duplicate

You must have access to the corpse of a humanoid that has been dead no more than 24 hours to graft this modification. Your monstrous minion has the face and features of the humanoid used to make this modification. When you graft this modification, make a leatherworker’s tools or sewing kit check. Creatures must make a Perception check with a DC equal to the result or your check to visually determine that your minion is not the humanoid used to create it, realizing it is a monstrosity on a success by 5 or more.

#### Monstrous Part

You must have access to the corpse of a monstrosity with a CR no greater than half your artificer level that has been dead no more than 24 hours to graft this modification. Your monstrous minion gains a trait or attack unique to that monstrosity, such as the barbed tail (and tail attack) of a manticore or the head (and gaze attack) of a yeti. The parts of a monstrosity that can grant an attack or trait are at the Narrator’s discretion.

#### Risen Beast

You must have access to the corpse of a beast with a CR of 1 or less that has been dead no more than 24 hours to graft this modification. Your monstrous minion uses the statistics of the beast with the **zombie template** (page 435 in *Monstrous Menagerie*), gaining the other improvements found in the Monster Minion feature as normal.

#### It’s Alive!

At 15th level you’ve beaten death—mostly. You gain the *resurrection* spell and when you prepare your artificer spells you can prepare it and create a spell invention for it (or forgo it for a modification) in addition to your normal number of prepared spells. This spell counts as a 5th-level artificer spell for you and you can cast it without the usual material components, but a creature you target with it gains the monstrosity type and cannot be targeted by this feature again.

## Lycanthrope Synergy Feats

Lycanthropes are defined by their ability to transform. While every lycanthrope receives specific traits depending on the animal their curse is related to, their transformations share some traits.

***Involuntary Change*.** You undergo a draining and painful involuntary change every full moon that leaves you hungry, unable to speak, and often confused and frightened. During the 1 minute transformation your statistics are replaced by those of a lycanthrope (as presented in *Monstrous Menagerie*), the Narrator takes control over your actions, and your thoughts are filled with predatory instincts.

When an involuntary change happens, you can either embrace the beast within or try to tame it.

**Embrace:** You lose all control over your actions until sunrise, but you retain your full memories the following day.

**Tame:** You make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you regain control over your actions for 1 hour. At the end of every hour, you repeat the saving throw. On a failure, you lose all control over your actions until sunrise and have no memories of what you did during the night.

***Hybrid Form.*** As an action, you can transform into animal form or into a half-humanoid, half-animal hybrid form.

This transformation is no less painful than an involuntary change, but you retain full control over your actions. You can revert to your normal form by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. You can transform into hybrid form and back once per long rest with no ill effects, and you suffer a level of fatigue for every subsequent transformation.

***Traits.*** While transformed into animal or hybrid form, your statistics change in the following ways.

* Your Armor Class is 13 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus.
* You cannot speak or cast spells.
* Any features or traits from your class, destiny, or culture are unaffected if your current form is physically capable of using them. However, you can’t utilize any traits gained from your heritage while transformed.
* Your equipment does not transform with you. Any clothes or armor are destroyed if you transform while wearing them.

***Wolfsbane Weakness.*** While in hybrid or beast form you are poisoned while within 10 feet of a living or dried wolfsbane flower that you can smell.

# Jabberwock

The jabberwock is a gangly, long-necked dragon native to the faerie realm. Although its appearance is unlikely, even the mightiest heroes must beware the jabberwock’s claws that grab and eyes of flame. Spellcasters in particular fear its burbling speech, a magical singsong that ruins spells and reduces words to nonsense.

JABBERWOCK CHALLENGE 18

20,000 XP

**AC** 20 (natural armor)

**Condition Immunities** charmed, confused, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, unconscious

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 21

**Languages** Jabber

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** When the jabberwock fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. It can’t do so against an effect that would sever one of its body parts.

***Reactive.*** The jabberwock can take three reactions per round. It can’t take more than one reaction on the same turn.

***Regeneration.*** The jabberwock regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. The jabberwock dies only if its head is severed. A creature can sever the jabberwock’s head by dealing 15 slashing damage to it in a single turn while it has 0 hit points.

***Vorpal Weakness.*** While the jabberwocky is bloodied, a roll of 16 or higher with a *sword of sharpness* or *vorpal sword* is treated as a 20.

***Whiffling Flight.*** The jabberwock’s flight is clumsy and unpredictable. While the jabberwock is flying it has disadvantage on attack rolls and attack rolls against it have disadvantage.

ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The jabberwock attacks once with its bite and twice with its claw.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) slashing damage. On a critical hit against a creature, the jabberwock’s teeth debilitate a limb until the character completes a long rest or is restored to full hit points. At the Narrator's discretion, the target might suffer a permanent wound that requires the *regeneration* spell. For a typical humanoid, roll 1d6: 1–3 arm (preventing the use of that arm to hold items or wear a shield), 4–6 leg (halving the target’s Speed).

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 21). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The jabberwock can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.

***Eyes of Flame (Recharge 5–6).*** The jabberwock’s gaze ignites everything in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

BONUS ACTIONS

***Burble.*** The jabberwock speaks in the magical Jabber language. Each creature within 30 feet of the jabberwock that can hear it and that doesn’t speak Jabber makes a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is subjected to a burbling curse. While cursed, half the words the creature speaks are replaced with words in the Jabber language. Each time the creature speaks, casts a spell with a vocalized component, or uses an

effect that requires listeners to understand its words, the creature must roll a d20. On a roll of 1–9, the speech is unintelligible or the spell or effect is wasted. The creature repeats the saving throw whenever it finishes a long rest, ending the curse on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Burble for 24 hours.

REACTIONS

***Claws that Catch.*** When a creature escapes the jabberwock’s grapple, the jabberwock makes a claw attack against that creature.

***Jaws that Bite.*** When a creature that the jabberwock can see makes a melee attack against it, the jabberwock makes a bite attack against that creature.

***Whiffling Dodge.*** When the jabberwock would be hit by a ranged attack while it is not flying, it flies up to its speed, imposing disadvantage on the triggering attack.

**Combat**

While flying, the jabberwock uses Eyes of Flame. The jabberwock then lands, attacking one opponent with a bite and a claw and a different opponent with its second claw. It focuses on spellcasters, grappling them and using Burble to hamper their spells. It prefers to use its reaction to bite a grappled creature. If it isn’t grappling a creature, it uses Whiffling Dodge. The jabberwock flies away if it takes slashing damage while it is bloodied. When it retreats, it carries with it any creatures it is grappling.

Jabberwock Variant: Jabberwocky

Jabberwocky is a CR 24 (62,000) XP) monster. It has 405 (30d12 + 210; bloodied 202) hit points and the following additional trait:

***Manxome Burble.*** Whenever a creature that was cursed by Jabberwocky speaks, each listener must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be subject to

Burbling Curse. A listener cursed in this way can’t spread the curse any further.

Jabberwocky has the following additional reaction:

**Eyes of Vengeance.** When a creature within 60 feet targets Jabberwocky with a spell or magical effect, or includes Jabberwocky in the area of a spell or magical effect, Jabberwocky immediately recharges and uses Eyes of Flame, including the attacker in its area if possible.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** When the fateholder fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, one of its eight eyes becomes dull.

Roll d8 on the list of Eye Beam secondary effects. Targets automatically succeed on saving throws against that effect.

**Psionic Awareness.** When a creature within 1 mile of the fateholder uses a psionic ability, the fateholder knows the creature’s direction but not its distance.

**Spider Climb.** The fateholder can use its climb speed even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.

**Web Walker.** The fateholder ignores movement restrictions imposed by webs.

ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The fateholder makes four claw attacks. It can replace any claw attack with an Eye Beam.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18).

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target grappled by the fateholder. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) poison damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is infected with pastrasites (Chapter 6: Maladies in Trials & Treasures) which first manifest during its next rest.

**Eye Beam.** Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d8) psychic damage and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be subjected to one of the following randomly chosen secondary effects:

1. *Alter Fate.* The target gains the doomed condition. It is aware it will die as a result of a bizarre series of coincidences in 13 (2d12) hours. In addition to the normal means of removing the condition, it can be avoided if the fateholder dies or chooses to end it as an action. Alternatively, the fateholder can instead permanently replace the target’s destiny with one of the fateholder’s choice. A character who has unlocked the fulfillment feature of their previous destiny is considered to have already unlocked that of their new destiny.
2. *Cut Strand.* The target takes an additional 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points it dies, its body disappears, and creatures that are more than 100 feet away when it dies forget about its existence until reminded. This effect can only be undone with wish or true resurrection.
3. *Foreshadow.* The next hit on the target before the end of the fateholder’s next turn is a critical hit.
4. *Seal Spells.* The target can’t cast spells or use psionic abilities until the end of its next turn.
5. *Shift Reality.* The fateholder teleports the target to an unoccupied space within 120 feet of the fateholder. The space must be on a solid surface but the fateholder doesn’t need to see it.
6. *Tangle Psyches.* The target is confused until the end of its next turn as several alternate versions of itself vie for mental control.
7. *Terrify.* The target is frightened until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, its Speed is 0.
8. *Twist History.* The fateholder alters a Large or smaller nonmagical object, or a 10-foot cube of a nonmagical Huge or larger object, within 5 feet of the target, replacing it with a similar object from another version of reality. The fateholder can create or destroy the object or change its nature (for instance, adding or removing a door to a wall). This change can’t immediately cause a creature or object to take damage or fall.

**Ethereal Web (Recharge 5–6).** The fateholder releases ethereal silk in a 60-foot cone. The area is filled with ethereal webs.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The fateholder can take 4 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Eye Beam.** The fateholder uses Eye Beam.

**Focused Eye Beam (Costs 2 Actions).** The fateholder uses Eye Beam. On a hit, it chooses the secondary effect instead of rolling it randomly.

Combat

On its first turn, the fateholder uses Ethereal Web. On its next turn, it makes claw attacks until it has grappled an opponent, and then uses eye beams with the rest of its attacks. If it starts its turn grappling a conscious creature, it bites that target. With its legendary actions, the fateholder uses its eye beam on whatever creature attacked it most recently.

When the fateholder is bloodied, it tries to escape by traveling through an ethereal web.

### Ethereal Webs CR 4

Ethereal webs can be their own encounter or used to make another encounter more challenging. A fateholder in its ethereal web is a CR 17 encounter. (If a fateholder uses an action to create an ethereal web during combat the encounter’s difficulty is not affected.)

Ethereal webs spun by fateholders act as gateways, allowing the spiders to travel between planes and store captured creatures where they can feed at leisure.

Such webs exist simultaneously in the Waking and the Ethereal Plane—if they’re destroyed on one plane, they cease to exist on the other as well.

Ethereal webs appear translucent, and at times almost fade from view. In dim light, it requires a DC 13 passive Perception check to spot the webs, though any active search will find them.

A creature that starts its turn in the webs or enters them on its turn is magically transported to the Ethereal Plane as if it were the involuntary target of the etherealness spell, unless it is on that plane already. It must also make a DC 14 Dexterity to avoid being restrained by the webs. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 14 Athletics check, escaping on a success. Creatures with the Web Walker trait are immune to being restrained.

A 10-foot cube of webs has AC 14, 15 hit points, and immunity to all damage types except fire and force. If it takes fire damage, everything in that 10-foot cube also takes the fire damage. When a creature leaves an area of ethereal webs, it decides whether it wants to magically travel to the Waking or remain in the Ethereal Plane.

The prophecy die increases and decreases as normal against other creatures.

Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Defiant (Berserker Archetype)

#### Impervious to Fate

Starting at 3rd level, you have advantage on saving throws against divination spells and effects, as well as immunity to any effect that would force you to reroll a die, though you may choose to accept beneficial rerolls.

This feature does not apply to rolling with disadvantage, as that calls for 2 separate rolls.

#### Against All Odds

Also at 3rd level, when you have disadvantage on ability checks or saving throws, you gain an expertise die. When you have disadvantage on an attack roll, you add your proficiency bonus to damage. Whenever you have disadvantage on any die roll, you can spend 2 exertion to roll normally instead. Starting at 11th level you can instead spend 4 exertion to turn the disadvantage into advantage.

Additionally, whenever you roll with advantage or disadvantage and roll the same result on both die, you become emboldened. Until the end of your next turn, your next weapon attack deals an additional damage die.

#### Impossible Blow

Starting at 6th level, while you are raging, you can spend 1 exertion when you deal damage. If the target is immune to this damage, it takes damage as though it were resistant instead. If the target is already resistant to this damage, it suffers normal damage.

#### Break The Unbreakable

Starting at 10th level, after you deal damage with a melee weapon to mundane objects or structures of Large size or smaller, roll a d20. On a roll of 15 or more, that object or structure is destroyed.

Additionally, when you attack an object or structure that can only be damaged by specific means (such as a forcecage), you can spend 2 exertion to have your melee weapon attack count as that specific mean.

#### Unfettered Stride

Starting at 14th level, after you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can spend 1 exertion as a reaction to move up to your speed and make a melee weapon attack against another target. This attack deals an additional damage die.

### Lore Weaver (Bard Archetype)

Bonus Proficiencies and Specialties When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Culture and History. If you are already proficient with either skill, you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain

If it cannot attempt this action or chooses not to, it is affected by your Bardic Inspiration as normal.

#### Plot Twist

Starting at 6th level, when a creature you have granted Bardic Inspiration to fails an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can spend your reaction to declare that isn’t how the story goes and allow it to roll again, including your Bardic Inspiration die, taking the higher result. This reroll spends the Bardic Inspiration die, even if the creature did not spend it on the first roll.

Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Feed the Muse

Starting 14th level, when you spend your last Bardic Inspiration you can spend a spell slot of a level no higher than your Charisma bonus as a free action to help drive the story. You regain a number of uses of Bardic Inspiration equal to half the spell slot spent (rounded up). Spending higher-level spells in this way only yields a number of uses equal to half your Charisma bonus (rounded up).

### Revoker (Herald Archetype)

#### Tenets of the Revoker

All revokers hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they serve.

* **Rise Above Your Past.** Don’t let your past define you. Judge others based on their actions now, not then.
* **Learn From Mistakes.** Never commit the same mistakes. Draw

knowledge from every failure. Remind others that defeat should be a turning point, not a dead end.

* **Choose Your Own Path.** Allow no one, not even deities, to decide your destiny for you. Grab fate by the neck.
* **Embrace Duty.** Choose the life of a hero. Defend the weak, punish the guilty.

#### Archetype School

Add the time school of magic to your list of herald spells.

#### Channel Divinity

At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

**Choose to Succeed.** When a friendly creature (including yourself) fails an ability check, you can spend your reaction to allow it to roll the check again with an expertise die.

#### Choose Your Fate

When you first select this archetype at 3rd level, you may select a different Destiny. If you have unlocked the Fulfillment Feature of your previous Destiny, the Narrator may rule that you count as having unlocked that of your new Destiny. You can only choose a new Destiny once using this method.

#### Unbound Heroism

Also at 3rd level, when you suffer damage, you can spend a spell slot as a reaction.

You gain resistance to that damage type until the beginning of your next turn and you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus times the spell slot spent. As long as you have these temporary hit points, your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

Additionally, any time you succeed at a death saving throw, you recover your lowest-level spent spell slot.

#### Divergent Wisdom

At 7th level, choose a cleric sign of faith or a fighter soldiering knack available to those classes at 7th level or lower. You learn the chosen feature.

#### Manifest Destiny

Starting at 15th level, you can use an action and expend one use of Channel Divinity to bathe yourself in holy light for 1 minute.

For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain an expertise die on Insight, Intimidation and Perception checks.
* When you miss a weapon attack, you deal radiant damage equal to your Charisma bonus.
* When you spend spell slots with Unbound Heroism, you gain twice as many temporary hit points and your additional radiant damage becomes 1d12.

#### True Calling

At 20th level, you gain your choice of either the Lawful or Good alignment traits.

## Weaving Prophecy

#### Ring of Inspiration Storing

Ring, rare (cost 3,000 gp)

**Crafting Components**: Vitrified heart of a khalkoi, webbing from a fateholder

Though all of them look slightly different, at the core of these rings is a strand of destiny spun by a fateholder to subtly empower and guide its pawns.

This ring stores inspiration and holds it for later use. While wearing this ring, you can choose to gain and use the inspiration stored within it. Once the inspiration is used, it is no longer stored within the ring.

When found, the ring contains 1d4 – 1 inspiration, as determined by the Narrator. The ring can store up to 4 inspiration at a time. To store inspiration, a creature with inspiration spends a short rest wearing the ring and chooses to bestow it. The inspiration has no immediate effect.

In addition, whenever inspiration from within the ring is used the Narrator may choose to grant a vision of possible future events of great import.

### Spinner Cult (Culture)

Characters raised in spinner cults share a variety of traits in common with one another.

**Necessary Skills.** You gain proficiency in either Deception or Insight and either Investigation or Perception.

**Cold Read.** When you first meet someone new and interact with them personally for at least 1 minute, you can ask the Narrator one question about them. This question must be a surface-level question about their personality or life, such as “do they have children?”, “what do they think of the duke?”, or “what do they want right now?” You have advantage on the next Deception, Persuasion or Insight check you make that uses this knowledge to benefit you.

**Discreetly Armed.** You gain an expertise die on checks made to persuade others to let you remain armed or to conceal weapons or items about your person.

**Oracular Talent.** You know one divination cantrip or 1st-level divination spell of your choice. If you choose a 1st-level spell, you can cast it once without spending a spell slot or providing material components, and must finish a long rest before you can do so again. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever is highest).

**Languages.** You speak, read, write and sign in Common and Undercommon

### Prophecy (Destiny)

**Source of Inspiration: Foresight.** You know in your very being that all things follow naturally from one another in a deterministic pattern, and that by planning in the present you secure the future.

Make a plan that snatches victory from the jaws of defeat, make a fool of a foe by remaining one step ahead of them, supply your allies with vital information, sow false or deceptive information among your foes, lay the groundwork for something that won’t pay off until potentially well after the end of your life.

**Inspiration Feature: Preordained Fate.** When you have 0 hit points at the end of another creature’s turn, you can spend your inspiration to gain 1 hit point. When you do, move your position in initiative to immediately after that creature’s turn, and take your turn normally.

###### Fulfilling Your Destiny

You fulfill your destiny when your part in the prophecy finally comes to an end. The specifics of this prophecy should be discussed with your Narrator, but should remain at least partially shrouded in mystery until the time comes for them to be fully revealed.

###### Fulfillment Feature: Total Clarity.

If the fulfillment of this prophecy results in your death, you get one final chance to alter the prophecy before you pass; treat this as equivalent to a wish spell, which you utter with your dying breath before passing on, impossible to resurrect.

If you survive the fulfillment of the prophecy, you gain a new lease on life. Having broken free from the tightest shackles of all, your will has been forged to be unbendable. While you have inspiration, you automatically succeed on saving throws against effects that would cause you to become charmed, confused, frightened, stunned, or paralyzed.

## The Fellspire

### Exploration Challenges

#### Festering Sewer Tunnels

*2nd tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); **DC** 16/14

**Area** Local (1 hour)

Built up beneath the streets, the sewers form a network of partially blocked, collapsed, and flooded tunnels. The air of this underground maze is thick with rot and the ever-present risk of disease.

**Clinical Eye.** Any adventurer that makes a Medicine check or casts detect poison and disease recognizes the risk of disease and contamination, allowing them to take precautions that grant advantage on any sullied miasma saves. This also enables an Engineering check (or a check made with tools the Narrator deems appropriate) that allows each adventurer to adequately protect any Supply they are carrying. This check must be made before the Supply is contaminated.

**Sullied Miasma.** The corruption of the area manifests as persistent,

barely-visible mist in these tunnels. Creatures who are bloodied upon entering (or who become bloodied while traversing) the sewers must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become infected with demon fever and nightmares of consuming their comrades. On a success, a creature is immune to the miasma for 24 hours.

#### Possible Solutions

Make a group check. Each adventurer may choose either an Acrobatics or Athletics check to use the unstable debris to keep dry, falling into the filth on a failed save and taking 7 (2d6) poison damage. A creature that does not need to breathe does not take this damage. An adventurer who makes an Engineering check or makes continuous use of the prestidigitation cantrip to keep themselves clean makes the check with advantage.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurers disturb a nest of malformed rats. Each adventurer takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage and must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract sewer plague.

**Failure.** Each adventurer that fails becomes poisoned an hour after they next consume any of their Supply and realize the rations were contaminated. This effect lasts for 24 hours and each such adventurer loses an additional 2 (1d4) Supply.

**Success.** The adventurers exit the sewers with no additional effects.

**Critical Success.** While traveling through the sewers the adventurers find something valuable or useful. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Insidious Gloaming

*2nd tier (supernatural)*

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); **DC** 17/15

**Area** Region (special)

The insatiable cravings and unnatural twilight of the city seep into travelers' minds, causing them to become ravenous and suspicious. Supply consumed as part of this challenge does not reduce an adventurer’s normal need for nourishment.

**Growing Hunger.** For every 4 hours spent in the city an adventurer must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they must consume a Supply or suffer one level of strife.

**Watchful Companion.** An adventurer succeeding on an Insight check is able to ignore their own hunger long enough to notice the rapacious looks on their companions' faces. On a success, this adventurer, as well as any other they mention this phenomenon to, gains an expertise die on their next roll against this challenge.

#### Possible Solutions

Adventurers can temporarily dispel the gloaming by holding an impromptu feast. If the feast lasts over two hours and at least 2 Supply is provided per adventurer, this triggers an automatic success as the

companions reconnect over a generous meal and conversation. It also delays the next growing hunger check for 24 hours.

Alternatively, a group check to bolster the party’s resolve can be made. For example, a Religion check to recall a sustaining meditation, a Performance check to provide pleasant distraction, or a Survival or Medicine check to confirm that, despite what they’re feeling, they’re actually sufficiently fed.

**Critical Failure.** Overcome by an

all-consuming hunger the adventurers fall to devouring and squabbling over every scrap of food and drink. In their frenzy, the adventurers consume or destroy all of their Supply and suffer a level of strife.

**Failure.** Each adventurer that failed discretely consumes 2 Supply while watching those around them for signs of treachery. If they cannot consume 2 Supply they suffer a level of strife.

**Success.** The adventurers manage to maintain their control and resist the Fellspire’s savage hunger.

**Critical Success.** Fighting off the encroaching mistrust renews the adventurer’s bonds and their confidence in each other. Each adventurer gains an expertise dice on the next action they take to help their comrades.

### Magic Items

#### Bloodiron Band

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 2,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Celestial blood harvested from pools deep beneath the Fellspire.

The Bloodiron Band gleams a metallic crimson and is set with dozens of spikes on the inside so that it pierces the skin as it closes on the forearm during attunement.

Wearing this band increases your Strength to 20. It has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.

**Curse.** Because of the horrific materials required in its construction, each band comes with a terrible cost. While attuned to

the bloodiron band, your maximum hit points are reduced by a number equal to twice your level. Additionally, at the start of your turn, if another creature within 15 feet of you is bloodied, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw (gaining advantage if the creature is an ally). On a failure, you must attempt to move to a space within reach and take the attack action against that creature.

#### Gloam Bread

*Wondrous item, common (cost 45 gold)*

**Crafting Components:** The ashes of a creature that died of starvation

These dark, dense bread rolls are incredibly filling, but leave an unpleasant, greasy taste in your mouth

Each piece of Gloam Bread is considered one Supply. When consumed, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws against the Fellspire Gloaming challenge for 24 hours. In addition, you can make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, reducing your strife by one level on a success. Once a creature reduces its strife in this way it cannot do so again until it has had a long rest.

#### Mindblade

*Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement, cost 6,000 gold)*

**Crafting Components:** An intellect devourer’s tongue

This item appears to be a dagger hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of purple flames to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals psychic damage instead of piercing damage. When a fey, giant, or humanoid creature is slain using this weapon, for the next 1d4+2 days the resulting corpse can be possessed (such as by magic jar or a ghost) as though it were still alive.

Alternatively, during that time you may expend a charge to use the dagger to animate the corpse as animate dead with a

casting time of 1 action. You must reassert your control over the undead creature within 24 hours using 1 charge, or it ceases obeying any commands. Casting the animate dead spell on such a creature has no effect. Regardless, it reverts to a corpse when the allotted time is up and cannot be reanimated in this way again. The dagger has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each dawn.

### Monster Variants

Pixie Variant: Askwise Keeper Askwise keepers have darkvision out to 60 feet, a speed of 20 feet, and cannot fly.

Instead of Faerie Light, they have the following trait:

**Shadow Shroud.** As a bonus action, the askwise keeper can dim the lighting for 30 feet. In that area, bright light becomes dim light, and dim light becomes darkness. This ability has no effect on magical light sources.

Instead of Faerie Blessing, the askwise keeper has the following action:

**Oath Keeper (3/day).** The askwise keeper targets up to 4 willing creatures within 30 feet who have just spoken an oath. For a year, the first time each day that one of those creatures takes an action that breaks the oath it takes 7d10 psychic damage. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell cast on the target using at least a 7th level slot ends this effect. The askwise keeper is always aware of the exact wording of the oath, who is currently under its effect, and can end the effect on a creature as an action.

Satyr Variant: Earless Hungerer An earless hungerer does not have proficiency with Performance but gains proficiency with Sleight of Hand. While mute, they communicate with signs in

Sylvan.In addition, it has the following traits:

**Deafened.** An earless hungerer is deaf, has disadvantage on perception checks based on sound, and resistance to thunder damage.

**Joyless Rage.** The earless hungerer gains advantage on attacks against creatures it has seen smiling, playing a musical instrument, or dancing, and criticals against such creatures deal an additional 1d6 damage.

Instead of Ram and Dance Tune, the earless hungerer has the following actions:

**Skull Smash.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. If the satyr moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack, the target makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or is stunned until the end of its next turn.

**Crippling Stomp.** Up to two humanoids within 5 feet with feet of the earless hungerer make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 3 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, their movement speed is halved, and they have disadvantage on attack rolls until the beginning of the satyr’s next turn.

#### Shambling Mound Variant: Sewer Walker

Instead of Lightning Absorption, the sewer walker has the following trait:

**Acid Absorption.** When the Sewer Walker is subjected to acid damage, it instead regains hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.

All of a shambling mound’s actions are all replaced with the following:

**Multiattack.** The shambling mound makes two lash attacks. If both attacks hit one Medium or smaller creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the sewer walker uses Drown against it.

**Lash.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Drown.** The sewer walker drags a Medium or smaller grappled creature under its body. The creature is restrained, rattled, can’t breathe, and moves with the sewer walker. At the start of each of the sewer walker’s turns, the target takes 11 (2d6 + 4) acid damage. When the grapple ends, the creature is no longer being drowned. The sewer walker can only be drowning one creature at a time.

## Avenging Archetypes

### Charging Shield (Fighter Archetype)

#### Shield Fighting

At 3rd level when you select this archetype, you gain proficiency with shields as weapons. In addition, you gain proficiency with the Charge maneuver, and when you are wielding a shield and no other weapons you do not have to spend exertion to activate it.

#### Inspiring Traditions

Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following combat traditions of your choice: Biting Zephyr, Rapid Current, Tempered Iron. When you gain this feature you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from your newly chosen combat tradition.

#### Shield Throwing

Starting at 7th level, you treat all shields except tower shields as having the throwing property (light 60/120 feet, medium 50/100 feet, heavy 40/80 feet). In addition, you gain proficiency with the Ricochet combat maneuver, and when you use a shield with it you do not have to spend exertion to activate it.

#### Galvanizing Charger

At 10th level, whenever you use the Charge maneuver and are wielding a shield and no other weapons, choose one creature within 60 feet that can see you.

At 18th level, you can use an action and move at least 20 feet to make an epic charge. While making an epic charge, you can move through the spaces of creatures and objects of up to one size larger than you without provoking opportunity attacks. When you move into a creature’s space it makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC (with disadvantage if it is your size or smaller), taking 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and remaining standing on a success.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Quickstepper (Adept Archetype)

#### Quips

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to get in the heads of your opponents. After you have observed a creature in combat for at least 1 round, you can make a quip at it. Make an Intimidation check opposed by the Wisdom saving throw of a creature within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. On a failed save the creature is compelled to attack you. On its turn, the creature moves towards you and makes as many attacks against you as it can. If the creature failed its saving throw by 5 or more, it has disadvantage on these attack rolls. Additionally, you do not have to spend exertion to use Patient Defense while a creature is under this effect.

The effects of this feature end after the creature hits you with an attack, when you attack a different creature, or if the creature is unable to attack you. Once you have

used this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Taunter

Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Intimidation. If you are already proficient, you gain an expertise die. In addition, you may always choose to use Wisdom when making an Intimidation check.

#### Deft Steps

Beginning at 6th level, you gain proficiency with the Expert Tumble combat maneuver, do not need to spend exertion to activate it, and can benefit from its effects even if you only move half your speed. In addition, you gain proficiency in Acrobatics. If you are already proficient, you gain an expertise die.

#### Entangling Throw

At 11th level, at the end of each short rest, you can put together a number of bundles of such materials equal to your proficiency bonus, each costing 5 silver worth of raw materials. Alternatively, if the Narrator determines the environment is suitable, you can collect the maximum amount of such materials at no cost on a successful Survival check to Hunt and Gather, while gaining half the usual amount of supply (rounded down).

Once each turn, you can spend 1 exertion to make an entangling throw at a target within 20 feet with a ranged weapon attack you are considered proficient at, either expending a bundle of material or using what is available in the environment (at Narrator discretion). You do not have disadvantage from making an entangling throw at a creature you have hit with a melee weapon attack since the start of your last turn from being within its reach. On a hit, the target makes a Strength check against your maneuver DC or becomes grappled. At the start of each of its turns, the target repeats the check, ending the effect on itself on a success. The material from the entangling throw can also be

destroyed (AC equal to your maneuver DC, hit points equal to your adept level).

Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Sharpened Tongue

Also at 11th level, you regain the use of Quips at the end of a short or long rest. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks.

#### Deadly Momentum

At 17th level, you can use an action and spend 8 exertion to make a melee weapon attack against a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier within 30 feet of you, making a separate attack roll for each target. For each subsequent hit after the first, you deal an additional 1d6 damage.

This still counts as a single Attack action for the purpose of Flurry of Blows or similar abilities.

#### Tireless

Also at 17th level, choose one of the following:

* Your speed increases as though you had taken the Adept Speed technique.
* You gain the Instant Step technique (as long as you meet the prerequisites).
* You only need to spend 2 exertion to use the Instant Step technique (if you have previously chosen it).

Additionally, once per short rest when you would gain a level of fatigue, you can choose not to gain that level of fatigue.

### Fantastic Fletcher (Ranger Archetype)

#### Fighting Style: Archery

Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make

with ranged weapons.

#### Augmented Arrows

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to craft ammunition for the job at hand. At the end of each short rest, you can craft a number of augmented arrows equal to twice your proficiency bonus, each costing 1sp of materials and an equal amount of ammunition. When you craft each augmented arrow, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. On a successful hit, the ammunition deals the usual amount of damage, but of the chosen type.

Additionally, you can use a bonus action to affix an item of Tiny size that weighs 3 pounds or less and can be used as an improvised weapon (such as an acid vial, alchemist’s fire, or unstable arcanum) to the end of a piece of ammunition. This increases the item’s range to that of your weapon’s normal range and allows you to roll as though it were a ranged attack with which you are proficient, though it only deals the damage and effects of the item, not the ammunition utilized.

#### Simple Trick Arrows

Beginning at 7th level, at the end of each short rest, you can craft a number of trick arrows equal to your proficiency bonus, each costing 1 gold worth of raw materials, as well as an equal amount of ammunition (augmented arrows cannot be used for this purpose). When you craft each trick arrow, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. On a successful hit, a trick arrow deals 1d8 damage of the chosen type (which counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity) in addition to that of the ammunition.

Due to their bulky nature, you can only use one trick arrow per Attack action (though you can still make your remaining shots with normal ammunition) and can only hit targets within your weapon’s normal range. Additionally, the materials of a trick arrow are unstable and lose their efficacy when you next take a short rest, though the

materials can be repurposed for a new trick arrow.

#### Advanced Trick Arrows

Starting at 11th level, when you craft a trick arrow, you may choose from force, necrotic, or radiant damage. In addition, on a critical hit the damage dice of extra damage from a trick missile increases from d8 to d12.

#### Impossible Shots

At 15th level, you gain an additional number of uses for your Accuracy Bonus equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, you can gain your Accuracy Bonus as a free action. they aren’t on the artificer spell list.

### Mutant (Warlock Archetype)

**TABLE: MUTANT EXPANDED SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **SPELL LEVEL** | **SPELLS** |
| 1st | *shield, thunderwave* |
| 2nd | *blur, force of will* |
| 3rd | *blink, haste* |
| 4th | *freedom of movement, stoneskin* |
| 5th | *storm kick, warrior’s instincts* |

#### Specialized Spellcasting

As your power stems from your inherent aberrancy and force of personality, you must choose Charisma as your spellcasting ability for this class. In addition, when you choose your Pact Boon at 3rd level, you can only choose from Pact of the Blade or Pact of the Tome, with the following alterations:

**Pact of the Blade.** When you summon your pact weapon it is infused into one of your hands and cannot be disarmed or removed until you dismiss it.

**Pact of the Tome.** You do not have a physical Book of Shadows but otherwise gain the benefits of this pact boon.

#### Catch Magic

Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, you gain the ability to touch magic itself and change its structure. When you are hit by a spell attack, you can use your reaction to absorb it, distilling it into a primal form of magic called mana, which you can eventually learn to harness. Make a spellcasting ability check opposed by the spellcaster. On a success, you negate the spell and convert it into a number of mana points equal to the level of the spell, regardless of the level of the spell slot it was cast with. Cantrips count as first level spells for this purpose. On a failure, or if you are unable to absorb the mana points that would be gained from the spell, it resolves normally.

The maximum number of mana points you can absorb equals your proficiency bonus. This resets at the end of a long rest and any remaining mana points disappear.

#### Infused Blasts

Starting at 6th level, you learn how to harness the power you’ve stolen. Once each round when you use eldritch blast, you can expend 1 mana point to alter its structure as a free action. Choose one of the following:

* You can push more power into the ability, increasing your eldritch blast’s damage by one die.
* You can alter the probability around the target. In addition to taking damage from the eldritch blast, it has disadvantage on its next roll.

If the attack is unsuccessful, the mana is lost. Expending mana does not allow you to absorb any additional mana points. These effects stack with any Eldritch Invocations you can use (though the damage is added and not multiplied in the case of abilities like Eldritch Squall).

#### Magical Manipulation

Starting at 10th level, your ability to affect magic and probability increases. When you or any ally you can see within 30 ft must

make a saving throw as the result of a spell attack or effect, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the saving throw.

One you have used this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, you cannot use it again until you have finished a short or long rest.

#### Inflict Aberrance

At 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can inflict aberrance upon it. It takes 10d10 psychic or radiant damage (your choice) as its mind or body is overloaded with the sensation of pure magic. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest.

## Well-Equipped: Steampunk Gadgets and Gear

### Mundane Equipment

###### Assassin’s Teapot. This

innocuous-looking teapot has two internal chambers. You can choose which chamber to pour from simply by covering the corresponding hole in the handle with your finger or thumb. True to its name, a common use of this device is to surreptitiously serve poisoned tea to someone, though benign uses are not unheard of. Pouring a cup of liquid (poisoned or not) from the teapot takes an action. (10 gp, 1 lb.)

**Autominer.** The autominer consists of a backpack with a small clockwork engine and two arms: a control arm and a working arm. The control arm has several small buttons and levers and is used to set the operation of the working arm.

The working arm is typically fitted with a mining pick with the breaker (stone) property, which deals 2d6 piercing damage on a successful hit. Axe variants, which have the breaker (wood) property and deal slashing damage, are popular with lumberjacks and adventurers alike.

To use the autominer, the clockwork engine must first be wound as an action either by you or another creature, enabling it to operate for 1 hour. Then, you must spend an action to target an adjacent square.

Immediately after, the autominer begins making a single attack per round on your turn against whatever is in the square, using an attack bonus of 4 + your proficiency bonus. Any creature passing through the square is also attacked once as if it had provoked an opportunity attack (there is no limit to the number of times this can happen). Attacks against creatures, including opportunity attacks, are made with disadvantage.

Once the autominer’s target is set, it swings continuously until its hour runtime is expended or the kill switch is activated. This

happens automatically if you use any movement, on account of the autominer’s safety feature. You can also trigger it manually as a reaction, which can prevent the opportunity attack above. Retargeting requires another action. While the arm is swinging, you effectively only have the use of one hand. (175 gp, 60 lbs.)

**Folding Glider.** This set of folding wings is worn as a backpack. You can extend or retract the wings as an action. While the wings are extended, you can move 30 feet horizontally for every 15 feet you descend vertically and cannot gain altitude. They are typically used to glide safely down from cliffs, airships, or high structures, and occasionally for reconnaissance. (40 gp, 30 lbs.)

**Parasol.** A cousin of the rain umbrella, parasols are smaller, lightweight folding shelters primarily used to keep the sun off. You gain an expertise die on saving throws due to extreme heat or sun exposure while using a parasol. You can open or close it as an action. (8 sp, 1 lb.)

**Spring-Heeled Boots.** These obviously-mechanical boots have a set of extremely high-powered springs built into them. While wearing them your jumping

distance increases 5 feet vertically and 10 feet horizontally. Additionally, you gain an expertise die on checks to reduce falling damage. (50 gp, 10 lbs.)

**Straight Razor.** A straight razor is a small folding shaving razor. If you use it as a weapon, it deals 1d4 slashing damage and has the finesse property. It is considered a simple weapon. (2 gp, 1/2 lb.)

**Sword Cane.** A sword cane is a stout wooden cane with a rapier concealed inside. The cane is clearly sturdy, but is frequently overlooked by security checks as a status symbol or fashion accessory. If you have the Cosmopolitan culture, you can increase the size of the expertise die granted by your Discreetly Armed ability by one step for checks related to retaining your sword cane. The head of the cane forms the pommel of the sword when drawn, and is often carved or otherwise decorated.

With the sword inside it, the cane counts as a mace with the stealthy property. Once the rapier is drawn, the scabbard counts as a club with the finesse property. Some users wield the scabbard and sword as paired weapons, others drop or cast it aside. (125 gp, 6 lbs)

New Vehicle Mechanics

**Medium Size:** A Medium vehicle has Strength and Constitution scores of 12 (+1), can carry up to 2 passengers along with the driver, up to 15 supply, and up to 5 bulky items in addition to 500 lbs. of carrying capacity. If a collision occurs, medium vehicles deal and take 2d6 points of damage.

However, a medium vehicle must be specifically created for occupants of at least a size smaller than the vehicle itself to hold passengers. If it instead has the personal property, a driver of the same size as the vehicle can operate it without penalty, while those one size smaller or larger than the vehicle must use an action to take the Drive or Maneuver vehicle actions. Creatures beyond that size range cannot operate it at all

**Small Size:** A Small vehicle has Strength and Constitution scores of 10 (+0), can carry up to 2 passengers along with the driver, up to 10 supply, and up to 2 bulky items in addition to 300 lbs. of carrying capacity. If a collision occurs, small vehicles deal and take 1d6 points of damage.

However, a small vehicle must be specifically created for occupants of at least a size smaller than the vehicle itself to hold passengers. If it instead has the personal property, a driver of the same size as the vehicle can operate it without penalty, while those one size smaller or larger than the vehicle must use an action to take the Drive or Maneuver vehicle actions. Creatures beyond that size range cannot operate it at all

**Muscle-Powered.** A muscle-powered vehicle relies on the strength of its rider for propulsion, so its movement speed is determined by that of the driver, except in the case of particularly ponderous vehicles. Multiply the base walking speed of the driver by the indicated value to get the speed of the vehicle, rounding the result down to the nearest 10 feet. For example, a muscle-powered (x3) vehicle operated by a creature with a speed of 35 has a speed of 100 ft/ 10mph. Most such vehicles are built to be operated by bipedal creatures.

Because these vehicles rely on physical strength to move, their carrying capacity is limited to double that of the driver unless otherwise specified. This limit includes any gear the driver or any passengers are carrying but not that of the creatures themselves. Most muscle-powered vehicles are personal and follow the

carrying-capacity rules for that property. In the rare cases they can have passengers, muscle-powered vehicles can only carry half the amount of supply and bulky items their size otherwise allows (rounded down).

**Special:** Muscle-powered vehicles do not have a standard journey speed. Instead, treat any journeying as a forced march with no DC increase for a normal pace and +1 for a fast/mounted pace. Additionally, the driver gains an expertise die on checks made to avoid fatigue on such a forced march. Any relevant benefits the driver has, such as the Forced Marcher exploration knack, apply.

### Enchanted Gear

#### Defensive Umbrella

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 1,800 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Shards of a +1 weapon

This is an unassuming-looking black umbrella, but it can provide impressive protection when needed. As a bonus action when the umbrella is open, you can press a button in the handle. The canopy immediately flattens and hardens into a *+1 light shield* and the handle transforms into a

*+1 rapier*. You count as already wielding both and are considered proficient as long as you are attuned to the *defensive umbrella*. You can return the sword and shield to umbrella form as an action by bringing the two parts together and speaking the command word. Opening or closing the umbrella requires an action.

#### Bicycle Bell of Flight

*Wondrous Item, rare (cost 3,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** A bicycle bell made of fine mithral and inlaid with gold filigree

This beautifully-filigreed bell can turn into a mundane bicycle of Small or Medium size (chosen at the time of creation) when you activate it as an action. Returning the bicycle to bell form also requires an action.

While riding this bicycle, you can ring its bell to gain a flying speed of 50 feet and the ability to hover. You can use the bike to fly for 2 hours, expending at least 10 minutes worth of time with each use. If you are flying when the time runs out, you fall at a rate of 60 feet and take no damage from landing.

The bell regains 1 hour of flying time for every 12 hours it is not in use, regardless of which form it is in.

**Curse.** While you are using its flying speed the bell frequently rings of its own accord, giving you disadvantage on Stealth checks.

#### Murderous Straight Razor

*Weapon (straight razor), rare (requires attunement*; *cost 3,500 gp),*

**Crafting Components:** A vial of blood taken by force from an innocent

This otherwise gleaming implement has dark stains that cannot be polished or scrubbed off. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this razor. A number of times per day equal to half your proficiency bonus, when you hit with a melee attack you can use a bonus action to channel the inherent hatred of the razor, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage.

***Curse.*** Once attuned to this weapon, you are cursed until you are targeted by *remove curse* or similar magic. Your appearance and manner have a hint of murderous rage at all times, giving you disadvantage on Charisma checks and making beasts hostile towards you.

Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with any other weapon and must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to willingly part with the razor, even temporarily.

#### Spectral Camera

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** A glass lens tempered on the Ethereal Plane

Favored by those who deal with hauntings, a *spectral camera* can capture the image of spirits on film. Any creature with incorporeal movement or on the Ethereal Plane (visible or not) that passes in front of the camera’s open aperture (up to 30 feet away) will trigger the camera to immediately take a monochrome picture. This has no effect on creatures affected by an *invisibility* spell.

You can also take a picture manually as a reaction. Once a picture is taken, you must spend an action to prepare the camera for another.

Unlike physical objects, incorporeal beings do not need to stay still to appear on the resulting photo, though the entire process takes 1 minute to complete. Such photos do not need to be developed and show ghostly subjects in crisp detail, while all mundane aspects (chairs, corporeal creatures, etc.) are at best mildly blurry.

Each picture taken with a spectral camera costs 2 gp in materials, which are significantly rarer than those for a mundane photograph. (300 gp, 15 lbs.)

#### Spirit-Trapping Camera

*Wondrous item, very rare (cost 50,000 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Glass lens immersed in holy water on a Celestial Plane for at least a year and a day, then blessed by a celestial associated with a god of life or protection.

Not to be mistaken for a simple *spectral camera*, this plain-looking but obviously finely-made piece gives off a subtle but reassuring feeling of peace. As an action, you can use one charge to focus the camera’s lens on a single creature within 30 feet and take its picture. If the targeted creature is an undead or a fiend, it must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be instantly captured in a glass photographic plate. If the target is not an undead or fiendish creature the charge is wasted. Any other creatures shown in the photograph are unaffected, even if they are undead or fiends. The *spirit-trapping camera* can produce as many plates as it has charges,

though each must be removed as a bonus action before you can use another charge.

A trapped creature can be released by breaking the plate or it can be sent to its final judgment (in the case of an undead creature) or back to its native plane (in the case of a fiend) by immersing the plate in holy water for 1 hour, at which point it disappears. Creatures banished in this way cannot return to the plane they were sent away from for a year and a day by any means short of divine intervention. If neither of these actions are performed within 24 hours of the photograph being taken, the creature is banished as above, though it has no limitations on returning.

The *spirit-trapping camera* has 3 charges and regains 1 each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, it becomes a mundane photochemical camera.

#### Useful Top Hat

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Hatband made of giant spider silk.

This stylish and sturdy top hat conceals a useful feature: a small pocket dimension. You may store up to 50 pounds worth of items in the extradimensional space.

Retrieving an item stowed this way requires a bonus action (to remove the hat) and an action (to retrieve the item). If you have never interacted with a specific *useful top hat* before, the first time you use it, it requires 1d4 rounds to take stock of its contents before anything can be retrieved from the bag.

As with all extra-dimensional storage, food or drink placed inside immediately and permanently loses its nourishing qualities, and a body placed in it cannot be restored to life by *resurrection, revivify,* or similar magic. Living creatures cannot be placed in the space and are merely stowed as though in a mundane top hat if it is attempted. The pocket dimension cannot be accessed until the creature is removed. The hat cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal hat of its apparent size or any item with the

Bulky quality. If the hat is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane.

Placing a *useful top hat* inside another extradimensional storage device such as a *bag of holding* results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.

At the Narrator’s discretion, you may keep the expertise die to Intimidation until the end of the scene.

Adventures and Advancement

The entity responsible for your curse may press you to complete specific tasks, such as transporting a mysterious item, defeating a hated enemy, or stealing important documents. Work with your Narrator to determine how your curse is leveraged in these situations. After you complete several such tasks, your infamy grows. You are known by all people within 100 miles of your Prestige Center, many of whom hold you in fearful respect. You and your companions are given a moderate lifestyle in settlements within this area by those who dare not risk your curse.

Whatever the location, the windows are shuttered and the doors secured with *arcane lock*. Inside, the armor stands to one side of the entrance, a suit of **animated armor** on one side and a mundane replica on the other.

A DC 10 Perception check means an adventurer hears a hollow moan from within, while a result of 14 or more reveals the glowing runes on the armor. A DC 15 Religion check alerts an adventurer that the runes are meant to bind incorporeal undead

When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, a **specter** emerges. After a quick attack to drain the attacker’s life, the specter then slips incorporeally through a wall, fades to invisibility, and harasses those already weakened by the animated armor’s attacks.

### The Coup de Gras

##### Level 4 Hard Encounter

This creation works best in some necropolis or mausoleum, walls lined with jagged spears or stony spikes (dealing 1d4 piercing damage to any creature forced into an adjacent space). A skeleton lies on the floor with its skull shattered and one arm outstretched, red paint on the floor meant to resemble a dying blood scrawl reads, “Coup de gras.”

In an archaic dialect of the Common tongue, coup de grâce is a ‘blow of mercy,’ to finish someone off. An adventurer who makes a DC 12 check translates this as ‘blow of fat.’

Beyond the warning, an oddly-wide sarcophagus stands upright and alone.

#### Trapped Sarcophagus

1st tier (constructed)

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); **DC** 15/14

**Area** Immediate

Surely there must be something valuable inside.

**Falling Doors.** When the pressure plate is triggered, both doorways into the room are blocked by heavy stone doors, each weighing 2,000 lbs. The switch to raise them again is inside the sarcophagus.

**Sarcophagus Lid.** When the pressure plate is triggered, the lid explodes off in an intense gust of wind. Any creature on the pressure plate takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and pushed back 5 feet. A DC 15 Dexterity save halves the damage and avoids the other effects.

**Trap.** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 15 or with a Perception check to notice the plate. If the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a critical failure.

Possible Solutions

Even if the adventurers notice the trap, there are multiple parts to this puzzle. Rolling or sliding something heavy enough (30 pounds or more) onto the plate will safely trigger the lid portion, but the falling doors still drop without a successful DC 14 Engineering or thieves’ tools check to disarm them.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer who stepped onto the plate must roll to avoid the sarcophagus lid. Failure on the saving throw also causes a level of fatigue.

**Failure.** The adventurer who stepped onto the plate must roll to avoid the sarcophagus lid.

**Success.** The adventurer disarms the trap.

**Critical Success.** The adventurer disarms the trap but has the option to leave the trap active for someone else to deal with.

Once triggered, cloud of dust and sand fills a 10-foot radius around the sarcophagus.

Immediately, the **mummy** within emerges and attacks, its cloth wrappings bulging outward like they’re holding in some great pressure. This gives the mummy a chubby, almost comical shape. While its bandages remain intact, the mummy has disadvantage on all checks to avoid or escape a grapple maneuver.

When the mummy is bloodied (reduced to half its hp), the remaining cloth wrappings are torn apart as the **air elemental** trapped inside bursts free, leaving the desiccated corpse of the mummy still standing.

The elemental looks like a tornado, and if the doors are open it attempts to flee. If the doors are still closed, it will use *whirlwind* to pick up PCs and drag them into the spikes on the wall, then deposit them beside the mummy so it can punch and curse them.

A DC 14 Perception check locates the mechanism to reopen the room’s doors inside the sarcophagus.

### The Stuffed Crab

###### Level 6 Deadly Encounter

This encounter takes place in an island warehouse, at the edge of the water, elevated on wooden pilings.

The warehouse is 30 foot wide and 70 feet long, and the interior is dark and smells of rotting fish. Chains dangle from the

30-foot ceiling, meant to help haul seafood catches in for processing. In the center two rows of 3 sluices: 5-foot patches of the floor are open to the swamp below so fish guts can be swept into the water. In the far corner, stairs lead up to an elevated office that overlooks the warehouse floor, and lantern light within casts the shadow of moving figures. Below it is a second office with darkened windows.

**Operated Trap.** The gnome cook is standing by in the second floor office to drop a portcullis over the door once the party enters. The apparatus can be spotted before entry with a Passive Perception of 15 or a Perception check and can be disabled

with a DC 14 Engineering or theives’ tools check.

Whether the party finds and disables the trap, magical lights flare around the room and a large mirror lowers from the ceiling. A wizard’s mocking face appears there, “I hope you’re hungry, because I’ve got some stuffed crab for ya!” Smashing the mirror reveals it is a **mimic**.

That’s when the **stuffed crab** (see below) bursts out of the lower office and scuttles toward them. The undead monster is stuffed with 7 **ghouls**.

Due to the huge crab’s state of decay, the location struck matters. Adventurers who attack it must choose one of the squares it occupies that they can target. On a successful hit, a ghoul falls prone into that space. If that space is over one of the gaps in the floor, the ghoul falls through, taking 7 (2d6) damage.

#### Fouled Sluice

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); **DC** 15/14

**Area** Immediate

Some unfortunate surprises lurk under this warehouse.

***Noxious Stench.*** All adventurers must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 round by the awful smell of rotting seafood.

***Solo Challenge.*** Each adventurer decides for themselves how to navigate the sluice.

***Swampy.*** The area under the floor is considered difficult terrain.

***Trap.*** This trap can be detected by a passive Perception of 15 or with a Perception check to notice the plate. If the trap is not detected, it automatically triggers a critical failure.

###### Possible Solutions

An Acrobatics or Athletics check allows an adventurer to safely drop to the swamp below. On a failure they fall and take 7 (2d6) damage.

**Critical Failure.** The adventurer falls and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage from the spikes and rolls the saving throw for noxious stench at disadvantage.

**Failure.** The adventurer falls and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage from the spikes.

**Success.** The adventurer successfully navigates the spikes.

**Critical Success.** The adventurer successfully navigates the spikes and rolls the saving throw for Noxious Stench with advantage.

However, even if an adventurer manages to drop down safely, the outer edge of this basement level is ringed with rusted metal wire. Clearing a space wide enough to squeeze through requires spending an action and a successful DC 10 Strength check. The crab can and will reach through the holes in the floor to pincer would-be escapees and pull them back up to the warehouse level.

When the crab is reduced to 0 hit points, any ghoul still inside takes crawls out on its turn.

STUFFED CRAB CHALLENGE 6

HUGE UNDEAD (2,300 XP)

**AC** 14 (natural armor)

**HP** 104 (16d12; bloodied 52)

**Speed** 40 ft., swim 40 ft.

**STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA**

20(+5) 4(-3) 10 (+0)10 (+0)1(-5) 8(-1)

**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver DC** 16 **Damage Immunities** poison **Damage Resistances** necrotic **Damage Vulnerabilities** bludgeoning

**Condition Immunities** fatigued, poisoned

**Senses** blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9

ACTIONS

**Multiattack.** The huge skeletal crab makes two *pincer* attacks.

**Pincer.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit; reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage. On a success, the target must make a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw or become grabbed (escape DC 16). The crab can grab up to two creatures.

BONUS ACTIONS

**Stuffing.** If the crab has a Medium or smaller creature grappled, it stuffs the

creature into its shell, taking 5 points of damage itself but trapping its target. The creature moves with the crab, but is considered restrained (escape DC 16). Every turn the creature remains restrained, each ghoul that is still inside the crab can make an attack against it with disadvantage.

**Combat**

The crab prioritizes grappling creatures and stuffing them into its exoskeleton, despite the damage it takes.

# Paths of Courtly Intrigue

### Optional Mechanic: Favor Points

Whether it’s a lavish gift given or a good turn done, favor points represent the social and economic obligations that can tie people together along with the information and services they can offer. These can be used in place of or in conjunction with the optional Prestige rule Calling in Favors.

The most important thing to remember about favor points is that they can only be spent in the region in which they are gained. You should keep track of the favor points you accrue in different areas as these persist until they are spent, though the Narrator may rule that they may diminish if you do not return to a region for a year or more.

Favor points do not reset to 0 after a long rest, but the maximum amount of favor points you can have per area is equal to your Charisma modifier.

#### Spending Favor Points

Favor points can be spent in a number of different ways. They don’t need to be tied to a specific debt owed or action taken, but it’s often more interesting if you provide a compelling reason behind spending a favor point. While the Narrator can grant the use of favor points in any number of ways, here are some common uses.

***Enticing Offer.*** You’re not just

well-known, you’re well-connected. When you would make a Prestige check to utilize the Calling in Favors mechanic, you may spend a favor point to gain advantage.

***Rumor Has It.*** You can suddenly recollect something interesting that could give you the upper hand. You can spend 1 favor point (at the Narrator’s discretion) to gain a 1d6 expertise die on an appropriate check before it is rolled. This is often (but not necessarily) during a social encounter, and the Narrator may rule that only so many favor points can be used with an NPC or during a scene.

***Smooth Over.*** You’ve made a mistake, but you have just the right explanation, convenient distraction, or charming mannerism to cover it up. After making an ability check for a social interaction but before the outcome of the result is known, you may spend 2 favor points to roll a second time and choose whichever result you wish. Favor points can only be spent on Smooth Over once per scene.

#### Gaining Favor Points

When you finish a long rest while in your Prestige Center and have no favor points remaining, you regain 1 favor point. If you are in your stronghold, you instead regain a number of favor points equal to half your stronghold’s grade (minimum 2 favor points). While outside of your Prestige Center, you must either gain favor points by performing notable deeds, impressive roleplay (granted at the Narrator’s discretion), or through the Network journey activity.

Journey Activity Favor Points Gaining influence doesn’t come without work. You can undertake a new journey activity: Network. At the Narrator’s discretion, you can also gain a favor point on a critical success for the Busk and Gossip journey activities, proving you are particularly competent or

well-informed.

New Journey Activity: Network Success on a Deception or Persuasion check allows an adventurer to make connections that will come in handy later. You can gain an expertise die on this check by making a bribe (or equivalent gift) of a number of gold pieces equal to 5 × twice the region’s tier (minimum 5 gold).

**Note:** To perform this journey activity, the party must be in a populated area such as a Country Shire, Open Roads, or Urban Township.

***Critical Failure.*** The adventurer commits some taboo or crosses a serious

social line and is firmly reprimanded or ostracized, suffering a level of strife.

***Failure.*** The adventurer simply isn’t engaging enough to be memorable.

***Success.*** The adventurer has made or reinforced a meaningful social connection or attained some level of influence, gaining 1 favor point.

***Critical Success.*** The adventurer has proven themselves exceptionally

well-connected, competent, or generous, gaining 2 favor points.

### New Equipment

***Candy.*** Typically sweet, these small bits of food (sold in packages of four or five pieces) are always flavorful and ideal for adventurers as their contents make them naturally preserved. Candy cannot be used as Supply.

***Tea.*** Also called a tsaine or infusion, these are specific leaves, herbs, and roots selected for their calming qualities. Quality of tea varies wildly depending on the desired ingredients. Those listed only include mundane ingredients with no notable medicinal qualities. Suitable, if crude, ingredients can be collected with the Harvest journey activity, granting 2 portions on a success or 4 on a critical success.

***Tea Set.*** Such sets vary greatly depending on culture and social class, but at minimum consist of a pot for brewing the tea with 6 matching cups. Depending on make and decoration, the price can vary greatly from those listed.

Also at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to make a Deception check opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated. On a success,

for the next minute you can use Sneak Attack against the creature even if you don’t have advantage, though not if you have disadvantage. This effect ends early if you use Unreadable Moves against a different creature.

fear, knowledge, law, obscurement. Your spell save DC is increased by 2 when casting a spell from the chosen school.

#### Stern Rebuke

At 10th level, you inflict mental harm upon a creature when it makes a saving throw against an enchantment or illusion spell you

have cast. A creature that fails its saving throw takes an amount of psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, twice as much psychic damage if it succeeds. A creature can only be damaged by your Stern Rebuke once every 24 hours.

#### Deceptive Mastery

At 14th level, choose one of the following.

#### Takes One to Know One

You have advantage on saving throws made against enchantment spells and illusion spells.

#### Well-Worn Deception

You can cast an enchantment or illusion spell using a spell slot that is one or more levels lower by spending 1 favor point. For example, you could cast *mislead* (a 5th-level illusion spell) by using a 4th-level spell slot and 1 favor point or with a 3rd-level spell slot and 2 favor points. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Militarist (Fighter Archetype)

#### Courtly Training

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills: Culture, History, or Insight. If you are already proficient, you instead gain an expertise die.

#### Prior Tactics

Also at 3rd level, you become superlative at preparing your fellows for battle. Your allies must spend at least 10 minutes a week discussing strategy with you to benefit from this feature, at which point you spend a number of gold pieces equal to twice your proficiency bonus on materials. At the Narrator’s discretion, these may be collected with a successful Hunt and Gather journey activity.

When taking the Attack action, you can forgo one attack to choose a number of allies equal to or less than your proficiency

bonus that are within 30 feet that can hear and see you, and spend an equal amount of exertion. On their next successful weapon attack, the chosen allies deal an extra 1d8 damage as they enact your recommended strategy. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Adept Coordinator

At 7th level, when using Prior Tactics the chosen allies gain an expertise die on their next spell or weapon attack.

In addition, damage dealt by an attack that benefits from your Pior Tactics counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistances and immunities.

#### Commander of Armies

At 10th level you learn a marshal lesson of war. Also, whenever you learn a new soldiering knack or replace an existing one, you can instead choose a lesson of war.

Additionally, using Prior Tactics costs 1 less exertion (minimum 1 exertion) and you can now choose for the extra damage dealt by it to be acid, fire, or poison damage.

#### Lead from the Front

Beginning at 15th level, when you use your Indomitable feature, you may immediately use Prior Tactics without spending exertion (no Attack action or attack to forgo required), its range increases to 50 feet, and you need not choose allies able to hear you.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws made to resist spells of the compulsion school.

### Tranquil Master (Adept Archetype)

#### Head of Ceremonies

Starting at 3rd level, you can spend 2 exertion to cast *ceremony* by way of ritualistically preparing a soothing drink for yourself and any creatures or corpses involved. This does not require any further material components and does not otherwise affect the spell.

#### Serene Mind

Also at 3rd level, your mental training helps you see the way forward. When you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check, you can add your martial arts die.

In addition, choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. When you fail a saving throw for the chosen ability score, you can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and reroll.

#### Unassuming

At 6th level, you gain an expertise die on Deception checks to appear less than you are and on Stealth checks. In addition, when you are hit by a melee attack you can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion to exude tranquility, rolling your martial arts die and adding the result to your AC (including against the triggering attack) for 1 round.

#### Reader of Leaves

Starting at 11th level, after a long rest during which you are able to consume and read the dregs of a warm drink, you roll a d20 and use a bonus action to choose a creature you can see within 30 feet, including yourself. The next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw that the creature makes, it uses the result instead of rolling a d20. Once you have used this feature after a long rest each additional use requires 3 exertion (and an additional d20 roll), and after using this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you may take 10 minutes to prepare and consume a soothing drink, after which you can spend 3 exertion to cast *divination* with no other material components.

#### Mastery of the Leaf

Beginning at 17th level, the gods bless you with a celestial talisman in the shape of a cup. In your hands it becomes a physical cup that provides all the hot drink (though not all the cups) needed for any of your features.

Once between long rests you can call upon the blessings of the gods and drink from the cup. Afterwards, you are immune to the blinded, deafened, charmed, and poisoned conditions. In addition, you can spend 1 exertion to use your Serene Mind feature on any ability check. Finally, once per combat you can use a bonus action to drink from the cup and roll your martial arts die, regaining an equal amount of exertion. These effects all last until the end of your next long rest.

If your talisman is destroyed, the gods provide another after you complete a worthy task to prove your continued dedication.

# Mount Jino

#### Exploration Challenges Sucking Bog

*1st tier (terrain)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100XP); **DC** 15/14

**Area** Intermediate (3 hours)

Mist hangs heavy in the air filled with the stench of rotting vegetation. Underfoot the soft peat shifts with a squelch and with each step the ground seems less willing to release a traveler's boots. Fetid pools block the way, requiring exhausting detours and backtracking.

***Arduous Trek.*** When traveling through this area at faster than a slow pace, at the end of every hour each adventurer and mount makes a Constitution saving throw or suffers a level of fatigue.

***Grasping Mire.*** When a creature is knocked prone, it makes a Dexterity saving throw or sinks into the mud and becomes restrained. A successful Strength (Athletics) check is required to fight their way free.

***Limited Visibility.*** The maximum range of any sight-based senses is 10 feet. In addition, Perception checks are made with disadvantage, and all passive scores (including passive Perception) are reduced by 5.

***Persistent Pests.*** Creatures that sleep in the same hex as the sucking bog without lavender paste or mosquito netting only regain half the usual number of hit dice and cannot reduce their levels of strife or fatigue.

#### Possible Solutions

Navigating the sucking bog requires a group Athletics or Survival check.

***Critical Failure***. The party becomes hopelessly turned around, losing 8 (1d5+3) hours of travel time. They each lose 4 (2d4) Supply and gain a level of fatigue.

***Failure.*** Each adventurer that fails becomes stuck in the bog and loses 2

(1d4) Supply. Additionally, the stench of the bog clings to them, giving disadvantage on Stealth and Persuasion checks until they can properly clean themselves.

***Success***. The adventurers make it through, filthy but unharmed.

***Critical Success***. The adventurers cross safely and swiftly, discovering something of interest at an abandoned campsite along the way. Roll on the Boons and Discoveries table.

#### Crumbling Masonry

*1st tier (constructed)*

**Challenge** 5 (1,800XP); **DC** 15/14

**Area** Immediate (less than 1 hour)

Part of the road has crumbled away, leaving this ruin to block the path ahead. There are abundant handholds in the crumbling 40 ft wall, making for easy climbing. However, the shattered stone strewn about suggests anyone falling may bring the wall with them.

***Heads Up.*** At the end of every 10 minutes spent within 30 feet of the wall, a random creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are struck by falling stonework and take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

#### Possible Solutions

The party needs to make a group check.

Engineering checks can be used to discern the most structurally sound part of the wall, or to dismantle part of it to create a passage. For the latter, the use of a block and tack, hammer, or crowbar provides an expertise dice for this check. Using damage dealing spells, black powder charges, or a portable ram gives disadvantage on the check.

Athletics checks can be made to climb the wall. Adventurers with a climb speed or with a set of climbing gear make this check with advantage. The use of a rope provides all connected adventurers with an expertise dice for this check. However, if one fails all others must make a Strength saving throw or also fail.

***Critical Failure***. The adventurers are buried in falling masonry, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, and are restrained, requiring an Athletics check to escape the debris. At the end of the next round, a rock troll arrives to investigate the noise.

***Failure.*** Each adventurer takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the debris and loses 2 Supply amongst the rubble.

***Success.*** The party makes it past the wall.

***Critical Success.*** The party creates a permanent hole in the wall or has identified an area that does not crumble. In either case, they do not require checks to pass the wall in this location in the future.

### Monster Variants

#### Troll Variant: Rock Troll

The rock troll is CR 6 (2,300 XP), has an AC of 18, and loses its keen smell. It has the following trait and version of the Regeneration trait:

***False Appearance.*** When motionless, the rock troll is indistinguishable from a typical boulder.

***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes thunder or cold damage, this trait doesn’t function on its next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

The rock troll has the following additional action:

***Ambushing Shove.*** The rock troll targets one Large or smaller creature within reach that either has not taken a turn in the combat yet, is within 5 feet of another enemy, or against whom the rock troll has advantage. The target makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the rock troll shoves the target up to 30 feet horizontally and knocks it prone. If the target strikes an object, such as a wall, it takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target would strike another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity

saving throw or both take the same damage and are knocked prone.

#### Manticore Variant: Canicore

The canicore is CR 2 (450 XP) and has 51 (6d10 + 18; bloodied 25) hit points. It does not have a tail spike volley action and loses its fly speed, but gains the following traits:

***Pack Tactics.*** The canicore has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the creature and not incapacitated.

***Gliding 30ft.*** Gliding allows the canicore to move horizontally 1 foot for every 1 foot it descends, falling if it moves less than 5 feet each turn.

***Poison Stinger.*** A creature that takes damage from the canicore’s tail must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Manticore Variant: Aracnecore

The aracnecore is CR 5 (1,800 XP), has 85 (10d10 + 30; bloodied 42) hit points, an AC of 16, and a proficiency bonus of +3. The aracnecore does not have the tail or tail spike volley actions and loses its fly speed, but gains the following traits:

***Spider Climb.*** The aracencore can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.

***Web Walker.*** The aracencore ignores movement restrictions imposed by webs.

In addition, the following replace their equivalent actions:

***Multiattack.*** The aracencore makes one bite and two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the paralysis on a success.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d4 + 3) slashing damage. If the manticore moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack, the target makes a DC 13 Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure.

# Cunning Curses

#### Cipher Sword

*Weapon (any sword)*, *very rare (requires attunement, costs 18,750 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** A quill from a phoenix, pressed in the pages of a spellbook with no fewer than three spells of 7th level or higher, which it consumes in fire over the course of a month.

This sword’s blade is plated with alchemical silver, its hilt stylized to resemble an open book from which the blade emerges.

Despite its masterfully-crafted appearance, however, a *cipher sword* is uncomfortable to hold and strangely unwieldy. It has the

two-handed and heavy properties and deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, but you feel this is only a fraction of its potential.

***Curse.*** There are other *cipher swords* owned by a variety of creatures across the planes. Most wielders consider themselves part of an exclusive group and expect the loyalty and cooperation of those with less mastery, regardless of other alliances. Attaining even a novice level of mastery attracts the attention of other wielders, who may have expectations of you.

The cipher sword also has the following properties:

* You are not considered proficient with this weapon.
* While wielding this weapon, you don’t benefit from any feature that would grant you additional attacks.

***Escalation.*** This weapon is immensely powerful for those willing to solve the riddle of its use. Once per week, if you’ve successfully reduced a dangerous enemy (as determined by the Narrator) to 0 hit points with it since the last time you finished a long rest, make a DC 14 Intelligence check to meditate on the sword’s secrets. On a failure, you gain +1 to future attempts at this check. On a success, your level of mastery increases, you lose any bonus gained from failed attempts, the DC to advance again increases by 4, and the time between

attempts increases by 1 week. If you ever willingly end your attunement to this weapon, you take 8 (4d4) psychic damage that cannot be negated or reduced and lose all mastery you’ve gained.

The levels of mastery are as follows: *Novice:* You now are proficient with this weapon, and it gains the finesse property. However, wielding anything else begins to feel wrong to you, and you suffer disadvantage on all melee weapon attacks made with a different

weapon.

*Apprentice:* You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. You can also now attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action with this weapon on your turn. Additionally, you now suffer disadvantage on all weapon attacks with other weapons.

*Expert:* Your bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon increases to +2 and it gains the Vicious property.

When you make a weapon attack with a different weapon, you now also take 4 (2d4) psychic damage. This damage cannot be negated or reduced by any means.

*Master:* Your bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon increases to +3, and you can summon it to your hand as a bonus action so long as you are on the same plane as it. Additionally, once per short rest, when you successfully attack a creature with it, you immediately learn about any special defenses or weaknesses that creature possesses as the blade imparts the wisdom of previous wielders.

Additionally, the psychic damage you take from making a weapon attack with a different weapon increases to 8 (4d4).

#### Circlet of the Apprentice

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement, costs 2,200 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Iron from shackles that a prisoner died wearing, powdered and combined with quicksilver.

This simple circlet has the color of lightly-rusted iron and is highlighted by a

large violet gem in its center, which appears to contain a slowly-moving metallic fluid.

While attuned to this circlet, you gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws. Additionally, when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can’t use this property again until the following dawn.

***Curse.*** The true name of the creature who crafted this circlet is forever instilled within it, and it becomes aware of you upon attunement. If that creature forces you to make a saving throw, you automatically fail, and you can’t use this circlet to succeed. You can learn the name of the creature with *legend lore* or similar magic. Short of powerful magic (such as *wish*), only the maker’s willing touch or death (yours or theirs) allows you to end your attunement to the circlet. If you willingly end your attunement after the maker’s death, the circlet loses all magical properties.

#### Crown of the Crystal Sovereign

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Unique (uncraftable)

This crown looks like a braid of pure crystal and its front is a set of three pointed, curling spires that give its wearer an imposing, regal silhouette. Once worn by the monarch of an ancient crystal palace deep underground, the crown was lost after its wearer’s grasping schemes brought calamity on their people. The power, ambition, and ruthless might of the Crystal Sovereign of Coranaal still lingers, granting the wearer the following properties:

***Crystal Skin.*** Your skin takes on a jagged, shimmering appearance and feels firm and cold to the touch. You gain +2 to your Armor Class. Additionally, when you’re hit by a ranged spell attack, roll 1d4. On a 3, you are unaffected and the spell is reflected back at its caster, rolling again to see if it hits.

***All-Seeing.*** You gain truesight out to 30 feet. Additionally, you can use this trait to cast *clairvoyance* at will, using the crown as your material component.

***Lord Under The Mountain.*** Your Prestige Rating is increased by 2, or 4 if you’re underground.

***Regal Bearing.*** A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier you can, as an action, target one creature that can see you within 60 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier) or use its next turn to fall prone in supplication, taking no other actions.

Additionally, when you’re targeted with any attack by a creature within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make this saving throw as a reaction. On a failure it has disadvantage on the attack and then falls prone as above.

***Greed of Coronaal.*** It’s said that, even as their palace crumbled, the Crystal Sovereign still coveted and guarded their treasures. You can use an action to summon an item from the hoard of Coronaal, an endlessly enormous extra dimensional space that you can access remotely. You instinctively know what’s inside, and when you first access the hoard, roll on Treasure for Challenge Ratings

23-30 to determine what’s already there. This doesn’t mean that you have any desire to share, however, and must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to willingly part, even temporarily, with any item that has been in the hoard.

You can also use an action to touch an item of up to Large size and send it to the hoard. However, the crown shuns items it deems unworthy, casting them into the Astral Plane if you attempt to store them. This includes magic items of common or uncommon rarity and any mundane items worth less than 500 gp. Additionally, as a security feature, creatures cannot enter this space; even the wearer can only access it remotely.

Otherwise, the hoard has the limitations of any other interdimensional space in regards to Supply and dead creatures. Placing another interdimensional item, such as a *portable hole*, in the hoard destroys the lesser item, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane. Additionally, 4 (2d4)

random valuables from the horde are also lost in this way, though the *crown of the crystal sovereign* is otherwise unaffected.

***Curse.*** When you attune to this crown, your Destiny immediately changes to Dominion if it’s not already, and you can only fulfill it by reclaiming the Crystal Palace of Coronaal, which is lost to time and overtaken by creatures from the depths. You lose any existing Destiny features. In addition, if you have a chance to advance this Destiny (as determined by the Narrator) and do not take it, you lose all benefits from the crown and suffer a level of strife each week until you pursue the opportunity, at which point you lose all strife gained this way and regain the benefits of the crown. These levels of strife cannot otherwise be removed.

The crown remains firmly affixed to your head and cannot be removed in any way, nor can your attunement be broken, unless you are beheaded, at which point you can never attune to the item again, even if you are brought back to life. The only other exception is if you reclaim the Crystal Palace and then choose to, in the presence of 4 sentient creatures, formally renounce your title while sitting on the throne of Coronaal, at which point the palace and crown begin to crumble, ending your attunement and destroying the item.

***Escalation.*** When you fulfill this destiny, the save DC of Regal Bearing and the Armor Class bonus of Crystal Skin increase by 2, while the range of your truesight increases by 60 ft, your Prestige bonus is increased by 2, and you can cast *scrying* at will using the crown as a focus.

#### Glory’s Glaive

*Weapon (glaive), uncommon (400 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** Hair from the mane of a lion, taken while it’s feeding on a fresh kill.

A red sash with gold trim adorns the haft of this glaive, the steel head of which is always polished to a mirror shine. The counterweight is made of brass and resembles a snarling lion, giving the

weapon a regal appearance that belies its prideful, capricious nature.

This glaive’s blade is dull, and cannot be sharpened by any whetstone, causing it to deal only 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. As a bonus action, you can attempt to flatter the weapon with a DC 13 Persuasion check. On a failure, you take 1d4 psychic damage that cannot be reduced or negated. On a success, the blade becomes sharp for 10 minutes. While sharp, it deals 1d12 slashing damage, grants +1 to attack and damage rolls made with it, and gains the flamboyant property. If it’s used in inglorious ways, such as for the execution of an unarmed foe or being used to cut down brush, it will immediately turn dull and refuse to become sharp until properly placated, as determined by the Narrator.

You can forgo your journey activity to spend time polishing, admiring, or training with *glory’s glaive* to gain a bonus equal to your Proficiency bonus on Persuasion checks to flatter it for the next 24 hours.

***Escalation.*** If you strike the killing blow in battle with a mighty or storied foe (as determined by the Narrator) with *glory’s glaive*, its ego can grow a maximum of twice. When its ego grows, its bonus to attack and damage rolls increases by +1, the DC to flatter it increases by 3, and the psychic damage taken on a failure increases by 1d4.

#### Ring of Battered Courage

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement, costs 2,500 gp)*

**Crafting Components:** The heart of an azer forgemaster killed in battle, encased in obsidian.

This jagged black ring made of volcanic rock is streaked with orange veins and uncomfortable to wear. While wearing this ring, you are immune to the frightened condition. Additionally, while you are bloodied, it grows hotter and grants the following benefits:

* Your AC increases by 1 for each hostile creature (squads and swarms count as single creatures for this

purpose) within 5 feet of you, to a maximum of +5.

* When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, roll 1d8. Add the result to the attack’s damage and gain the same amount of temporary hit points.

***Curse.*** You fail death saving throws on a roll of 12 or lower. Additionally, this ring despises what it sees as cowardice. If you don armor or use a shield defensively, you lose all benefits of this ring for 1 week.

***Escalation.*** When you show extraordinary courage in the face of certain death and emerge victorious, this ring’s power can evolve, gaining one of the following features. For each power it gains, the threshold for successful death saving throws increases by 2.

*Charge Into Danger.* As a bonus action while bloodied, you can move up to your movement speed toward a hostile creature.

*Coward’s Bane.* Creatures never gain advantage from being unseen on attack rolls against you and you always have resistance to poison damage.
