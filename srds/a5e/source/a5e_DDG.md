# Exploring the Dungeon

## Heritages

Many of the species that dwell in Underland’s winding caverns are little known on the surface world. Only the most well-traveled mycelials, oozefolk, rockborn, or motley have seen the light of the sun.

Ratlings and doppelgangers, on the other hand, are familiar to, though rarely welcomed by, aboveground communities.

**Size.** In their true form, doppelgangers can stand anywhere from 3 to 6 feet tall, but they can adopt the size and build of any Small or Medium humanoid. Your true size is Small or Medium.

**Speed.** 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** You have darkvision out to 60 feet.

**Age.** Mycelials grow from spores and mature quickly. In mycelial communities, a sporeling is considered an adult by the age of 3. They usually live about 30 years, although mycelials who form bonds with longer-lived creatures have been known to live as long as the creatures they’re bonded with.

**Size.** Small.

**Speed.** 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** You have darkvision out to 60 feet.

**Soft Bodied.** You can squeeze or contort through spaces as if you were one size category smaller than you are.

**Spore Cloud.** Mycelials naturally produce poisonous spores, which they can use to attack or defend themselves.

You can use a bonus action to release a puff of poisonous spores in a 5-foot-radius area centered on you. The

spores lightly obscure the area and linger in air or water for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind or current. Non-plant creatures that enter the area for the first time on a turn or start their turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The poison damage increases to 2d6 at 4th level, 3d6 at 9th level, 4d6 at 14th level, and 5d6 at 19th level.

Once a creature has been affected by the spores, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# Archetypes

## Adept: Arachnid Guardian

### Guardian’s Arsenal

Starting at 3rd level, you become proficient with hand crossbows, longbows, rapiers, scimitars, shortbows, and whips. These weapons count as adept weapons for you.

You also gain proficiency with poisoner’s kits. When you use a poisoner’s kit to harvest poisons, you do not poison yourself on a failed roll (though you still do not collect any poison).

### Lurking Spider

Also at 3rd level, you gain some of the sneakiness and vigilance of a spider. You become proficient with the Stealth and Perception skills, and you can move through magical and mundane webs without treating them as difficult terrain or risk of becoming stuck.

Finally, you gain tremorsense with a range of 10 feet.

### Wall Crawler

Starting at 6th level, you gain a climb speed equal to your Speed, as well as the ability to walk on walls and upside down on ceilings.

### Ambush Predator

Also at 6th level, once per turn when you hit a creature that is unaware of your presence with an unarmed strike or weapon attack made with an adept weapon, you can spend exertion to deal additional damage to it.

Each point of exertion you spend increases the additional damage you deal by an amount equal to your martial arts die. When

you use this ability, you can spend a number of exertion points up to your proficiency bonus.

### Web Spinner

At 11th level, you gain the ability to spin ropes and nets from magical spider silk. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 exertion point to conjure one of the following magical webs:

* **Rope:** You conjure a 50-foot-long rope made of magical spider silk. The rope weighs 1 pound but can support up to 8,000 pounds. It has an AC of 14, 10 hit points, and can be burst with a Strength check equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus.
* **Net:** You conjure a net made of webs. It weighs 1 pound and functions as a normal net weapon, with the following modifications: It has a range of 20/60, can trap creatures of up to Huge size, and has an AC of 14 and 20 hit points. The DC of the Strength check to escape the net is equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus. You can create a stronger net by spending more exertion; for every additional point you spend, the net’s hit points increase by 10.
* **Whip:** You conjure a whip made of spider silk. The whip functions as a

*+1 whip*.

Regardless of what form your webs take, they dissolve after 1 hour.

### From Nowhere

At 17th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 3 exertion points to shift to the Ethereal Plane. At the end of every minute you remain on the Ethereal Plane, you must spend 1 exertion point; otherwise, you immediately shift back to the Material Plane. You can return to the Material Plane deliberately as a bonus action, and doing so costs no exertion.

## Bard: Sound Sculptor

#### Sound Sculptor’s Tools

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Performance skill and two musical instruments of your choice. If you are already proficient in Performance, you gain an expertise die instead. You also learn the *message, minor illusion,* and *thaumaturgy* cantrips, and they do not count against your maximum cantrips known.

#### Eyes of the Ears

At 3rd level, you learn to use sound to locate objects and creatures around you. As an action, you can sing, chant, or play a musical instrument, concentrating on your music as if it were a spell. Until the start of your next turn, any creature within 300 feet of you that can hear you automatically detects your presence, but you also gain blindsight with a range of 30 feet. If you already have blindsight, its range increases by 30 feet.

#### Blast of Sound

At 6th level, you learn to use sound not just as a tool, but as a weapon. As an action, you can emit a powerful blast of sound in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the blast must make a Constitution save against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 2d8 thunder damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn’t deafened. The damage increases to 3d8 at level 11. At 17th level, the damage increases to 4d8 and the blast becomes a 30-foot cone.

#### Wall of Sound

At 14th level, you gain the most potent sound sculptor ability: the creation of walls of sound. As an action, you can create a

wall of solid sound. The wall is composed of twenty 5-foot-square, 10-foot-tall sections of solid sound.The sections must be contiguous, and all sections must be within 120 feet of your position; otherwise, you can form the wall in any shape you desire. The wall’s space is difficult terrain, and reverberations in the air make objects on the opposite side of the wall lightly obscured. Ranged attacks fired through the wall are made at disadvantage. A creature that enters the wall’s space for the first time on a turn or that starts its turn inside the wall must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target loses concentration (if applicable) on any spell or effect they are concentrating on and is deafened for one minute. On a success, the target has disadvantage on Perception checks relying on hearing until it exits the section of wall, but is not deafened and does not lose concentration. You must concentrate to maintain the wall (as if concentrating on a spell), and it vanishes if you lose concentration. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish a long rest.

## Berserker: Troll Slayer

Trolls, particularly cave trolls, are reasonably common in Underlands, and so too are troll slayers. This much is known.

What enjoys less consensus is whether “troll slayer” means “one who slays trolls” or “one who slays in the manner of a troll.” There is plenty of evidence to support both interpretations. Certainly, a troll slayer’s flaming weapons and acidic blood make short work of trolls, but their ability to manifest troll-like physical traits (such as rapid healing, claws, and a keen sense of smell) show an affinity, not an animus, for troll-kind. What everyone agrees upon, however, is that these berserkers are exceedingly dangerous.

#### Trollrage

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel your fury in a manner that trolls find both terrifying and familiar. You learn a maneuver from the Tooth and Claw tradition that you meet the prerequisites for, and it does not count against your maneuvers known. When you enter a rage, choose one of the following options:

Fiery Armaments

Your melee weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 fire damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at 15th level.

Troll Claws

You grow long, sharp claws like a troll, which allow your unarmed strikes to deal 1d6 slashing damage and count as weapons with the finesse and dual-wielding properties. At 10th level, the damage of your claws increases to 1d8. While your claws are manifested, Tooth and Claw maneuvers have their exertion cost reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.

When you reach level 11, you can manifest both effects simultaneously.

#### Keen Smell

Also at 3rd level, you have advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.

#### Acidic Blood

At 6th level, your very blood becomes anathema to the regenerative abilities of trolls. You gain immunity to acid damage. In addition, whenever a creature damages you with a bite attack, it takes 3d6 acid damage from your acidic blood.

#### Self-Knitting Flesh

Also at 6th level, you become extraordinarily resilient, gaining powerful healing abilities and allowing you to shrug off effects that would make harm done to you persistent.

You are immune to effects that would prevent you from regaining hit points or that would lower your hit point maximum.

While you are raging, you can use a bonus action to expend one of your hit dice, rolling it and recovering hit points equal to the roll’s result + your Constitution modifier. Any hit points gained in excess of your normal hit point maximum are converted to extra rage hit points instead. This does not increase the number of rage hit points you can have at one time.

#### Withering Wrath

At 10th level, your fury magically suppresses the regenerative abilities of your foes. While you are raging, a creature with a regeneration ability that starts its turn within 10 feet of you regains only half as many hit points as normal (rounded down).

You also gain the supernatural ability to devour life force from downed foes. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you recover one expended hit die. For you to do so, the creature’s CR must be at least half your character level (rounded down).

#### Troll Slayer Apotheosis

At 14th level, when you rage, the reach of your melee weapon attacks increases by 5 feet. In addition, other creatures can no longer detect you using their sense of smell.

## Cleric: Labyrinth Priest

**TABLE: LABYRINTH PRIEST SPELLS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **CLERIC LEVEL** | **SPELLS** |
| 1 | *floating disk*, *skeletal hands (DDG)* |
| 3 | *knock*, *magic map (DDG)* |
| 5 | *gaseous form*, *passwall* |
| 7 | *stone shape*, *thunder bolt (DDG)* |
| 9 | *escape (DDG)*, *passwall* |

#### Light Step

When you choose this archetype at 1st level, your Speed increases by 10 feet while you are unarmored or wearing light armor. Also, armor you wear does not impose disadvantage on your Stealth checks.

#### Inspired Explorer

Also at 1st level, you always know which direction is north. You gain proficiency in Survival, and you gain an expertise die on Survival checks you make to navigate through mazes.

Additionally, whenever you cast a divination spell of 1st-level or higher, you gain an expertise die that you can apply to one Intelligence or Wisdom ability check you make within the next 10 minutes. You can possess only one expertise die gained in this way at a time.

#### Channel Divinity: Forge Ahead

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to remove afflictions from creatures you can see. As an action, you present your holy symbol and call out for guidance that removes the blinded, charmed, deafened, and frightened

conditions, or one level of fatigue or strife, from one creature you choose within 30 feet of you.

#### Blessed Exploration

At 6th level, you gain darkvision to a range of 90 feet. Additionally, choose one of the following benefits:

Minotaur’s Memory

You can perfectly recall any route you have traveled.

Shadow Sustenance

If you haven’t been in an area of sunlight for 24 hours, your body begins to fade and you no longer need to eat. This benefit ends when you enter an area of sunlight.

#### Insightful Knack

At 8th level, you can spend 1 minute studying your environment and attempt a DC 15 Insight check. On a success, you notice something of significance, such as a coded message, a secret door, a hidden chest, or the tracks or other signs of a nearby creature. The nature of the information you intuit depends on the location you are in—the Narrator can always decide there is nothing for you to intuit about your current location or may offer a clue leading to a more relevant location instead. Once you have used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

#### Labyrinth

Starting at 17th level, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to cast the *maze* spell.

## Druid: Decomposer

#### Life at the Bottom

At 2nd level, you are immune to ingested poisons. This also allows you to eat and drink spoiled provisions without consequence. In addition, whenever you would make a Survival check to forage, you can make the check with advantage. If you do, any food you find is rotting and spoiled, making it inedible for most creatures.

#### In the Cracks

Also at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to assume a wild shape. In addition, you gain an additional form you can assume using your Wild Shape feature: a Medium swarm of Tiny beasts. When you adopt this form, you don’t gain temporary hit points, and while in this form you can’t gain hit points or temporary hit points. In this form, you can move through other creature’s spaces and pass through any space a Tiny creature could without squeezing. The only actions you can take while in this form are the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions.

Your game statistics are unchanged, except for one of the following benefits, which you choose when you shift:

* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* You don’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving out of a creature’s reach.
* You have a climb speed equal to your Speed, and you can walk on walls and upside down on ceilings.
* You have a fly speed equal to your Speed.
* When you enter a creature’s space for the first time on a turn, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking piercing damage equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier on a failure, or half damage on a success.

If you revert to your normal form before 1 minute has passed, you regain the use of Wild Shape you expended to take this form.

#### Decomposing Touch

At 6th level, you learn to use your unique connection to the cycle of death and rebirth to your advantage. While in your normal form or swarm form, you can use an action to touch the corpse of a Medium or larger creature that has been dead for 10 days or less and magically regain one expended spell slot. The spell slot you regain can’t be higher than 5th level or half your character level, whichever is lower. When you use this ability, the corpse you touch rapidly decomposes and becomes unrecognizable. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Virulent

At 10th level, you can repurpose disease as a tool of decomposition. When you would contract a nonmagical disease, you can choose to become a carrier of the disease instead. You can be a carrier of only one disease at a time. While you are a carrier of a disease, the disease does not affect you, but it remains dormant in your system.

When you touch a bloodied creature or hit it with a melee weapon attack, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature contracts the disease you carry.

Additionally, you always have the *contagion* spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you’ve cast *contagion* in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. When you cast *contagion*, you can choose to spread the disease you’re carrying, instead of one of the diseases presented in the spell’s description.

#### Vermin Master

At 14th level, adopting swarm form no longer expends a use of your Wild Shape, and you gain all the listed benefits, instead of choosing one. Additionally, you can cast spells while in swarm form even if they don’t have a range of Touch or Self.

## Fighter: Dungeoneer

#### Close-Quarters Fighting

Starting at 3rd level, you have adapted to the confined conditions found in dungeons, and you fight best with a wall at your back.

When you gain this feature you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from your newly chosen combat tradition.

#### Dungeon Crawler

Starting at 7th level, your experience exploring dungeons has made you a veteran of the depths, able to smash your

way through common obstacles with ease or endure whatever hazards you encounter.

Choose one of the following options:

Aggressive Delving

* You gain the Close-Quarters Fighting feature you did not select at level 3.

#### Dauntless Delver

Starting at 18th level, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as to acid, necrotic, and poison damage, until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish a long rest.

## Herald: Stone Warden

#### Tenets of the Stone Warden

All stone wardens hold similar tenets, regardless of the deity they serve.

* **Enduring Stone.** Those you defend must be able to trust in your resilience.
* **Stable as Stone.** You must be consistent, dependable, and fair in your dealings. Let no hint of caprice or pique cloud your judgment, but cleave to what is right.
* **Strong as Stone.** You must be willing to shoulder far more than your “share” to walk this path.
* **Will of Stone, Not Heart of Stone.** You must be incorruptible, implacable, and uncompromising, but this must be tempered with empathy and compassion. Strength without goodness is worse than weakness.

#### Archetype School

Add the protection school of magic to your list of herald spells.

#### Channel Divinity

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

**Earthen Resolve.** When you are subjected to an effect that would alter your behavior, (such as becoming charmed, confused, or frightened) or that would allow another creature to dictate your actions (such as the command spell), you can use your reaction to negate that effect on you.

**Rock Skin.** You can use an action to cover yourself in a magical layer of gray stone plates. You gain temporary hit points equal to your herald level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). The temporary hit points last up to 1 hour. While the temporary hit points remain, critical hits against you are treated as normal hits.

#### Rooted Defense

At 7th level, while you are standing on a solid surface, you can use a bonus action to root yourself in place. While rooted, your Speed becomes 0, but whenever an effect would move you or knock you prone, you ignore that effect, and the ground within 10 feet of you becomes difficult terrain. In addition, while you are rooted, a creature you hit with a melee weapon attack must make a Strength save against a DC of 10 +

your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the creature’s Speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. You can end your rooted state as an action.

#### Shield of the Vulnerable

At 15th level, when a creature you can see damages you or a creature within 5 feet of you with a weapon or spell attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to 1d6 + half your herald level (rounded down). You must be using a shield to use this feature.

#### Immovable Object

At 20th level, you can become a living fortification—immovable and unbreakable. You can use a bonus action to become an immovable object, gaining the following benefits for the next minute:

* You gain resistance to all damage.
* You can’t be moved unless you choose to be, even if targeted by an effect that would teleport you or if the surface you are standing on gives way.

## Marshal: Expedition Leader

Lead By Example

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, choose one of the following benefits:

On Guard

When you use your Rallying Surge to allow a creature to regain hit points, that creature also gains an expertise die on one saving throw it makes in the next minute. The creature chooses whether or not to

use the expertise die before making the save, and the die is wasted if not used before the effect ends.

On the Watch

Allies within the radius of your Commanding Presence gain an expertise die on ability checks made to avoid, locate, or disable traps.

Got Your Back

Starting at 7th level, when an ally falls unconscious while within range of your Commanding Presence, that ally has advantage on the next death saving throw they make (either as a result of taking damage or at the end of their next turn).

Explorer's Code

Also at 7th level, you learn to communicate with your allies using coded language, allowing you to hide additional messages in normal conversation. During the light activity portion of a long rest, you can teach this code to any friendly creature with which you share a language. It takes twice as long to convey a message this way. Observers might be able to detect that you're speaking in code, but only creatures who've been taught the explorer's code understand it.

Follow the Leader

At 11th level, choose one of the following benefits:

Mindfulness

You attune your breathing to the vibrations of the world around you, increasing your ability to sense your immediate surroundings. You and creatures you choose within the radius of your Commanding Presence gain tremorsense to a range of 10 feet.

Team Tactics

## Ranger: Tenebrous Stalker

#### Pierce the Dark

At 3rd level, your senses sharpen to allow you to perceive your lightless environment. If you have the ability to see, you gain darkvision to a range of 120 feet and the ability to see through magical darkness. If you have blindsight, the range of your blindsight increases by 30 feet.

#### Embrace the Dark

Beginning at 7th level, you can enshroud yourself in darkness. As an action, you can activate your shroud of darkness. Your shroud remains active for 1 hour, until you fall unconscious, or until you use a bonus action to deactivate it. While your shroud is active, light within 30 feet decreases from bright light to dim light, from dim light to

darkness, or from darkness to magical darkness. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Wield the Dark

Starting at 7th level, when you start your turn in an area of darkness or magical darkness, you gain a Darkness die, a d6. You can have only one Darkness die at a time. At any time, you can roll your Darkness die and apply the result to one of the following: your AC against one attack made by a creature you can see, an attack or damage roll you make with a weapon, or a Stealth skill check.

## Rogue: Shadow Stalker

#### Hidden Attacker

Starting at 3rd level, you excel at staying hidden from your enemy’s sight even when on the attack. If you start your turn hidden from one or more creatures, you can activate this power to remain hidden from

them until the start of your next turn. Attacking does not reveal your position, and you do not need cover to remain hidden.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Shadow Stealth

Also at 3rd level, you are nearly undetectable when in the shadows, cloaking yourself in inky darkness and dampening the sounds of your movements. You gain advantage on Stealth checks when in darkness.

#### Deadly Blades

Starting at 9th level, you specialize in dealing killing blows when you catch your enemy unaware or on the back foot. You deal an additional 2d6 Sneak Attack damage when you hit a creature with a melee weapon and have advantage on the attack roll.

#### Stash the Evidence

Also at 9th level, you are adept at disposing of the corpses of your victims and squirreling away valuables you find on your adventures. Perception and Investigation checks made to find items you have hidden are made with disadvantage.

#### Vanishing Words

Starting at 13th level, your words have the power to make people forget their interactions with you. As an action, you can make a Deception check contested by the Insight of one creature who can hear and understand you within 30 feet. If you win the contest, the target forgets anything you have said over the last 5 minutes. You can

choose for the target to believe instead that you were either silent the entire time or engaged in meaningless small talk. The first time a bystander reminds the target of your interaction with them, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw to recall the conversation. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

Once you’ve used this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

#### Erase from Memory

Starting at 17th level, you can draw on the power of darkness to literally disappear and make your enemies forget you were ever there. You can use a bonus action to magically become invisible for 1 minute.

Attacking does not break this invisibility.

In addition, each creature within 60 feet that sees you use this ability must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + you proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the creature’s memories of you over the past hour are erased; while they still remember the basic events of that time, their memories have been altered not to include you. The target’s memories of actions you take after you use this ability are not affected.

Once you’ve used this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

#### Earthen Flesh

you choose this archetype at 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. In addition, when you choose this archetype, choose either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If you end your turn without moving, you gain resistance to nonmagical damage of that type until the start of your next turn.

#### Stonestrider

Also at 1st level, you ignore difficult terrain caused by stone or earth. Additionally, standing up from prone costs you no movement when you’re on unworked ground.

You can speak, read, write, and sign the Terran dialect of Primordial.

#### Quake

At 6th level, the very earth on which you walk reacts to your magic. When you cast a

spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one of the following:

* Choose a point you can see within 60 feet. Large or smaller creatures on the ground within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, falling prone on a failure.
* Sprouting rock formations erupt around you in a 5-foot radius. The ground in this area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you until the end of your next turn.
* Choose a Large or smaller creature you can see within 30 feet that is on the ground. The creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Glide

At 14th level, you can pass effortlessly through natural stone. You gain a burrowing speed equal to half your walking speed. You can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth, and when you burrow in this way, you leave no tunnel behind you. If you’re burrowing through stone and you end your movement inside the stone, you take bludgeoning damage equal to your level as it attempts to crush you.

Additionally, stone in all its forms is no longer a hindrance to you. You ignore difficult terrain caused by molten rock, can walk on it as though it were solid, and take no damage from it unless submerged.

Finally, your spells that manipulate stone can now be used on worked stone.

#### Heart of the Mountain

At 18th level, when you cast a spell from the earth school (or that has “earth” or “stone” in its name) that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it as a bonus action instead.

Additionally, you gain tremorsense to a range of 60 feet. If you are touching unworked stone, you can use an action to expand your consciousness through it, increasing your tremorsense to a range of 500 feet until the start of your next turn. This provides you with insight into the layout of nearby caves and any creatures on the ground in that area.

Finally, you can use an action to magically petrify yourself. While petrified in this way, you are aware of your surroundings and immune to all damage. You do not age, nor do you need to eat, sleep, or drink. While petrified in this way, you aren't incapacitated, but you can't take actions or reactions except to end this petrification as an action. You can’t be petrified by any other effect, unless you choose to be.

## Warlock: Fatewoven

#### Tangled Destiny

When you take this archetype at 1st level, your connection to the weave of fate begins to manifest in tangible ways. You learn the *guidance* cantrip and choose one of the following:

Destined Curse

You can use a bonus action to place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you or the target dies, if you are incapacitated, or if you use another bonus action to end the curse. The curse has the following effects:

* When you deal damage against the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 force damage. This extra damage increases by 1d4 at

10th level, and again at 15th and 20th level.

* You gain a pool of destiny dice, which begins empty. Each destiny die represents a small adjustment you can make to the web of fate. Whenever the cursed creature rolls with advantage or disadvantage, add one destiny die to this pool. When a creature other than you that you can see rolls a d20, you can spend a destiny die (no action required) to add 1d4 to the roll or subtract 1d4 from it. The pool disappears when you finish a short or long rest.

Once you have used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

Step Through the Web

You can use a bonus action to teleport up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Cautious Premonition

At 6th level, you can focus your connection to fate to determine the outcome of an action you are about to take. After you declare your action but before you resolve it, you can choose to have a premonition. Roll a d20. This roll will be used as the first attack roll or ability check you make during the action, if you perform the action. You can then decide whether to proceed with the planned action, accepting the rolled result, or take a different action, discarding the result.

If you choose not to proceed with the action, you can either take a completely different action (casting a spell or making an

ability check instead of making a weapon attack, for example) or do nothing, but you can’t take another action of the same type (such as casting a different spell or attacking with a different weapon). Your premonition only reveals the result of a single d20 roll; if you roll with advantage or disadvantage, you learn the result of only one of the two dice. Similarly, if you have an ability that would allow you to reroll, you do not get to see the reroll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but never more than once per turn. You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Overwhelming Visions

At 10th level, you can open a creature’s senses to the full scope of possibilities before it. As an action, you force vivid visions of discarded pasts and possible futures into the mind of a creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 8d8 psychic damage and is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn’t stunned. Furthermore, a creature that successfully saves against the effect finds the wash of possibility insightful, gaining advantage on the next ability check or saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

Once you have used this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

#### Pluck the Strands

At 14th level, you gain the ability to influence fate directly. As a bonus action, you can select a number of creatures that you can see up to your spellcasting modifier. Until the start of your next turn, the creatures you choose have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Once you have used this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

## Wizard: Oozemancer

#### Ooze Familiar

When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you master the conjuration of tame oozes. You add the *find familiar* spell to your spellbook. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or choose a **gray ooze**. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own.

In addition, oozes you summon move extremely quickly, increasing their Speed to 25 feet.

#### Ooze Within

Also starting at 2nd level, your body becomes more ooze-like, allowing you to thwart attackers. Whenever you are subjected to a critical hit, the hit is treated as a normal hit instead. In addition, you are immune to Sneak Attack damage from class features or traits. Finally, you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws you make to escape a grapple.

#### Improved Ooze Familiar

Starting at 6th level, when you cast *find familiar*, you can choose to summon a **gelatinous cube** or **ochre jelly**. At 9th level, you can summon a **euphoria cube** (DDG) or **flash jelly** (DDG).

#### Liquid Form

At 10th level, you learn revolting arcane secrets that allow you to transform your body into slime. As a bonus action, you can adopt a liquid form. You revert to your normal form after 1 minute, if you are incapacitated, or if you use another bonus action to end the effect early. Once you have used this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again. In liquid form, your statistics are

unchanged except for one of the following options, which you choose when you transform:

* You liquefy your bones, organs, and equipment to gain an amorphous form. While you are amorphous, you can pass through an opening as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. While in this form, you can’t use or gain any benefit from your equipment.
* You liquefy your skin, causing your body and equipment to become covered with a viscous, sticky slime. While you are coated in this way, you leave slimy, wet prints on objects and surfaces you touch or walk upon. You gain a climb speed equal to your Speed and can walk on walls and upside down on ceilings. Additionally, when a creature within 5 feet hits you with a melee attack, it is covered with slime. The creature has disadvantage on the next attack it makes before the end of its next turn.

#### Ooze Without

Starting at 14th level, while you are bloodied, you can use a bonus action to cause your viscous blood to coalesce into a **black pudding** that appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This ooze takes its turn immediately after yours and obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the ooze only defends itself. It disappears after 1 hour, when reduced to 0 hit points, or if it can’t sense another creature at the end of its turn. Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

# Equipment

#### Uses for Existing Equipment

**Climbing Kit.** This is the gold standard for parties venturing into underground environments. Not only are caves rife with surfaces that must be navigated by climbing, the individual components of a climbing kit are useful in their own right. In particular, a climbing kit contains crampons and pitons.

**Crampons.** Crampons is the more technical name for the spiked “boot tips” mentioned in the climbing kit. While wearing crampons, you are unaffected by difficult terrain caused by ice. Crampons can also deliver a nasty kick; once per turn when you make an unarmed strike while wearing crampons, the attack deals 1d6 piercing damage. Crampons are awkward when walking on flat surfaces, however. While wearing crampons, you have disadvantage on Stealth checks and you cannot use the Dash action.

**Pitons.** These heavy-duty metal spikes have a myriad of uses. They can be driven into the seams of doors to jam them shut or used to hang various things (such as pulleys or anything one wants kept dry in a flooded area). They can also be used to secure tripwires or as anchor points for tie downs.

**Hammer or Miner’s Pick.** In addition to being suitable improvised weapons, these tools can be used to carve handholds, drive pitons, or even create makeshift ladders or stairs, though this process is both noisy and slow. Hammers and picks are also highly effective at smashing locks, doors, and similar objects. When used as improvised weapons, these implements are considered

to have the Breaker property, dealing double damage to unattended objects.

**Waterskins.** As long as they don’t leak, waterskins can be used as impromptu air bladders. A typical 1-gallon waterskin holds enough air to allow a Medium or smaller humanoid to catch their breath twice.

### New Equipment

**Air Bladder.** An air bladder is similar to a waterskin but can hold up to 2 gallons of air when fully inflated, allowing for four breaths. It has a valve at the opening, eliminating the need for removing and replacing a cover or cap. When at least half inflated, an air bladder can also function as a flotation device, granting a creature holding it advantage on Athletics checks to avoid sinking.

**Alchemical Weapon Oils.** These oils can be applied to a weapon, increasing the damage the weapon deals and sometimes providing other benefits. Applying an alchemical weapon oil requires an action, and the effect lasts for 1 hour.

* **Corrosive Oil.** A weapon coated with this pungent green liquid deals an additional 2d6 acid damage.
* **Frigid Oil.** A weapon smeared with this bluish-white paste deals an additional 1d6 cold damage.
* **Glaring Oil.** Sometimes called “portable sunlight,” this cloudy, silvery-white oil sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. A weapon treated with glaring oil deals an additional 2d6 radiant damage.
* **Lifebane Oil.** This viscous black liquid trails thin, mist-like tendrils of darkness at all times. A weapon coated with lifebane oil deals an additional 1d8 necrotic damage.
* **Scorching Oil.** This thin red oil ignites when exposed to air. A weapon coated with scorching oil

deals an additional 1d6 fire damage and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

* **Shocking Oil.** This vibrant yellow oil arcs with a powerful electrical current. A weapon coated with shocking oil deals an additional 1d4 lightning damage and sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius.

**Ascender/Descender.** These small metal devices allow better control of ropes when climbing up (ascender) or sliding down (descender), granting a creature using them an expertise die on Athletics checks to move in the corresponding direction.

Despite their similar names, ascenders and descenders work differently. Ascenders are mechanical devices that assist in climbing. Descenders are small metal loops that facilitate better control of ropes while rappelling. A creature can use only one of these devices at a time. The listed price is for a set of one of each device.

**Boat, Collapsible.** When deployed, this two-person boat resembles a kayak or canoe. It can hold up to 500 pounds without sinking and can fold up enough to be carried by a single humanoid. (While folded, the boat has the Bulky property; a creature can carry a number of bulky items equal to one plus its Strength modifier.) Setting up the boat (which comes with two folding paddles) or collapsing and packing it takes 20 minutes.

**Cave Tent.** This tent has a padded base and anchor points at the peak. It dampens sound and minimizes the vibrations produced by its occupants, which many underground predators use to hunt.

Creatures sleeping or performing light activities inside the tent are invisible to tremorsense. However, a cave tent can keep out rain for only an hour before it starts to leak.

**Luminescent Compass.** The needle and directional markings of this compass are

treated with a luminescent compound. It can be read easily in dim light or darkness.

**Pole (10-foot), Collapsible.** This lightweight but sturdy metal pole can telescope to a length of 10 feet but can also be locked at 3, 5, and 7 feet if desired. At its 5- and 7-foot lengths, it functions as a quarterstaff. At its 3-foot length, it functions as a club.

**Rope Ladder.** This collapsible ladder is made from two ropes connected to a series of rungs, with a pair of hooks at the top to anchor it. Rope ladders are easier to climb while carrying a lot of gear and can be used by creatures who lack the strength or coordination to scale a rope. A rope ladder must hang from a solid anchor point to be useful.

**Basic Rope Ladder.** This rope ladder has hempen ropes and wooden rungs. It is 10 feet long when deployed and can support up to 500 pounds of weight without breaking.

**Heavy-Duty Rope Ladder.** This model has silk rope and metal rungs. It is 25 feet long and can support up to 750 pounds, but thanks to the lighter materials it weighs the same as the 10-foot model.

**Snorkel.** This sturdy, angled tube allows a creature swimming beneath the surface of a body of water to breathe, provided the snorkel can poke above the water level.

Snorkels are invaluable for cave swimming, where there may be pockets of air but the ceiling is too close to the water for a swimmer to position their head above the surface.

**Spore Netting.** Based on mosquito netting, spore netting is made from giant spider silk, allowing for an even finer weave. It can keep out toxic fungus spores as well as biting insects.

**Spring Holster.** This bracer-like device allows a creature to draw a very small weapon such as a dagger, shuriken, or derringer from a concealed position up the

creature’s sleeve. Drawing a weapon from a spring holster requires a reaction but can be done at any time.

**Underwater Lantern.** This sturdy metal lantern uses bioluminescent fungus in a sealable glass box to shed bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. As long as the fungus is tended once every 7 days, it remains useful indefinitely.

**Underwater Lantern, Alchemical.** Using the same compounds as alchemical torches, this lantern can burn for 1 hour, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. It can be refueled for 25 gp.

**Wand Bracer.** This leather bracer has several channels (the usual number is five) along the underside. Each channel is sized to hold a wand or similarly shaped item, such as a throwing dagger or an individual lockpick. Once on your turn, you can draw an item stored in the bracer without using an action or interacting with an object.

Stowing an item in the bracer requires an action.

### Cultural Equipment

Underground dwellers carry specialized gear that helps them carve out an existence in the unforgiving depths. Aboleth, deep dwarves, shadow elves, grimlocks, sewer ratlings, and tinker gnomes all create unique equipment that they rarely share with outsiders.

An adventurer with the appropriate culture can buy cultural equipment during character creation. Beyond that, cultural equipment is available at the Narrator’s discretion, either for sale from a friendly settlement or as treasure wrested from foes.

Aboleth Equipment

Adventurers with the sunless mariner background can buy aboleth equipment during character creation.

**Gill Symbiote.** This bizarre, collar-like mask fits like a sleeve over the user’s lower face and neck. It extends tendrils down the user’s throat when donned, a process that requires the wearer to make a DC 11 Wisdom save to avoid gaining a level of strife. Once in place, the symbiote allows the user to breathe air and water, but it also distorts the wearer’s voice. Whenever the wearer speaks, other creatures must make

a DC 10 Intelligence check to understand what they are saying. In addition, a creature wearing a gill symbiote must make a DC 10 Intelligence check to cast a spell with vocalized components. On a failure, the creature expends the spell slot to no effect.

**Octopack.** This bulbous, fleshy mass attaches itself to the wearer’s back and can sprout four tentacles on demand. The tentacles aren’t able to hold items, but they grant advantage on checks to maintain a grapple and grant an expertise die on Athletics checks related to climbing.

**Parasite Launcher.** This bracer-shaped creature has ray-like skin and several rows of glowing, fluid-filled membranes on its “back,” which typically sits atop the user’s forearm. Swimming in the fluid are small, snake-like creatures with nasty, tooth-filled maws. The launcher is a ranged weapon with a range of 30/60. It is fired via mental commands rather than a physical trigger. On a hit, the parasite deals 1d4 piercing damage. A creature hit by the parasite launcher can use its reaction to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the target tears off the parasite before it gains purchase. If the creature does not remove the parasite, the parasite begins burrowing into the target’s flesh, dealing 1d4 piercing damage and 1d4 psychic damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. A creature can use action to cut out the parasite, dealing 2d6 slashing damage to the target but ending the piercing and psychic damage. Unless removed, the parasite continues to burrow for a number of rounds equal to the proficiency bonus of the creature that fired the launcher. The parasite then dies inside the target, and the target suffers a level of strife from the trauma of the experience. The parasite launcher does not cover the user’s hand, leaving it free to wield other devices or weapons. A parasite launcher can be fired from an arm that is wielding a weapon, but not a shield. The launcher holds eight parasites, and the “ammunition” regrows after 24 hours.

**Sleepless Mask.** This disturbing, fleshy mask covers the upper half of the wearer’s face and features three, vertically placed eyes in the manner of an aboleth. While the mask is worn, each eye takes an 8-hour turn sleeping while the others remain awake, effectively sleeping for the wearer and allowing them to stay awake indefinitely. The wearer must still sleep or meditate to receive the benefits of a long rest. In addition, the tendrils that the mask sends into its wearer’s brain subtly influence them toward obedience to aboleths. The wearer suffers a -1d4 penalty on saving throws against aboleth abilities and the Sea Change disease.

**TABLE: ABOLETH EQUIPMENT**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Item** | **Cost** | **Weight** |
| Gill Symbiote | 50 gp | 2 lbs. |
| Octopack | 25 gp | 5 lbs. |
| Parasite Launcher | 500 gp | 3 lbs. |
| Sleepless Mask | 125 gp | 1lb. |

Grimlock Equipment

**Air Ink.** An odorless, pitch-black gas that blocks light, air ink is usually deployed in grenade form. As an action, a creature can throw an air ink grenade up to 30 feet at a point it can see. When it lands, the grenade detonates, filling a 10-foot-radius area with inky darkness.

Two varieties of air ink exist: a “safe” version that merely blocks light and a “dangerous” version that also interferes with breathing. A creature inside an area of dangerous air ink must hold its breath or it begins to suffocate. In either case, the air ink lasts for 10 minutes. While the ink remains, the area it fills is heavily obscured. Only blindsight can penetrate the ink; even creatures with traits such as Devil’s Sight can’t see through it.

**De-Scenting Powder.** Available in either a shaker or a “bomb” that fills a 10-foot square, de-scenting powder rapidly absorbs scents from everything it touches, making creatures to which the powder has been applied impossible to detect or track by scent for up to 1 hour. A shaker contains 10 uses, each enough to cover a Medium or smaller creature.

**Portable Telegraph.** This boxy device is usually worn on a belt clip. When activated, it emits a high-frequency sound that most humanoids can’t hear. Grimlocks use these telegraphs as either echolocation devices or communication tools. When used for echolocation, the range of the grimlock’s echolocation or blindsight increases by 10 feet, provided the grimlock doesn’t move more than 10 feet on their turn. When used for communication, the telegraph can produce a sequence of long and short beeps, similar to those of traditional telegraphs. When used in this manner, the telegraph can transmit messages up to 500 feet. An experienced operator can use an action to transmit up to six words that only by grimlocks or other creatures with echolocation-based blindsight can hear.

**Sonic Tripwire.** Made up of two small metal boxes, a sonic tripwire can be used to trigger any trap or alarm that a normal tripwire could. Between the boxes, the device emits a beam of high-frequency sound that grimlocks can hear but most other creatures cannot. The tripwire triggers when the beam is interrupted.

Deep Dwarf Equipment

**All-Purpose Pick.** This pick is obviously well-made, but the shape of its head and handle are a bit unusual. The wielder can treat the pick as a war pick or a miner’s pick as they choose.

**Folding Armor.** This finely made plate armor is designed to work in conjunction with the wearer’s size-altering magic. If the wearer is subjected to the enlarge effect of an *enlarge/reduce* spell, in addition to altering its size, the armor deploys vicious spikes concealed in the unfolding mechanisms, gaining an improved version of the Spiked property: a creature that begins its turn grappling or grappled by the wearer takes 1d4 piercing damage.

If the wearer is subjected to the reduce effect of an *enlarge/reduce* spell, the armor instead folds in on itself, reinforcing vulnerable areas and raising its AC bonus by 1.

**Stone of Resolve.** This brittle, cloudy orange crystal is found only in the deepest mines, but it is widely coveted for its

mind-stabilizing properties. A creature can use an action to crush the crystal and inhale

the dust, gaining advantage on saving throws against fear for 1 minute.

| All-Purpose Pick | 20 gp | 6 lbs. |
| Folding Armor | 3,000 gp | 70 lbs. |
| Stone of Resolve | 50 gp | — |

Ratling Equipment

**Food Cannon.** Named for its most common ammunition, this tube-shaped weapon uses black powder charges to fire whatever is packed into it. When loaded with foodstuffs or dirt, the food cannon blasts everything in a 15-foot cone with the contents of its barrel. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity save or be blinded until the end of its next turn. A creature can use an action to scrape off the debris from an affected creature, ending the condition early. The cannon isn’t powerful enough to deal severe damage, but if hard debris is packed among the soft shot, each target also takes 1d4 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, depending on the nature of the debris.

**Thing-Thing.** One of the most distinctly ratling pieces of gear is the thing-thing, a generic name for two items combined into one. Examples include the

quarterstaff-ladder (a quarterstaff with pop-out rungs) and the dagger-lockpick

(thieves’ tools on strings packed into the hilt of a dagger), but the possibilities are endless and frequently seem nonsensical to non-ratlings. A thing-thing costs as much as both items combined and weighs as much as its heaviest component. If one item is smaller than the other, the smaller item may be unobtrusive, requiring a DC 18 Perception check to find. Neither piece of a thing-thing can be consumable.

Tinker Gnome Equipment

Some tinker gnome inventions are automata that can move on their own. Each automaton comes with a necklace or other piece of jewelry that can be used to control it. A creature wearing the jewelry can use a bonus action to make an automaton move up to its Speed or perform an action listed in its description. An automaton is an object that is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage. It automatically fails all saving throws, but it is immune to all conditions except prone. An automaton’s AC, hit points, and Speed are listed on the table below. A creature proficient in Engineering or with tinker's tools can restore all hit points to a damaged automaton during a long rest.

**Clockwork Mule (Automaton).** About 6 feet long and 4 feet wide, this automaton is little more than a Large cart with tracked treads. It has a carrying capacity of 1,000 pounds and is most often used to haul equipment, freeing up adventurers to carry only their most important gear.

**Life Detector.** This hand-held device helps answer one of the most important questions an adventuring party can ask: “*What’s behind that door?*” As an action, a creature can use the device to detect creatures that aren’t constructs or undead within 60 feet, displaying their current locations on a crystalline matrix. The device can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. This device is an exception to other tinker gnome items, as it is powered by divination magic (and so can be disrupted by *dispel magic* or thwarted by *nondetection*)*.* Once the life

detector has been used, it can’t be used again for 4 hours.

**Lock Master.** This metal gauntlet has small probes and picks affixed to its fingertips.

The wearer gains an expertise die on Dexterity checks made to open locks and disarm traps when using the lock master.

**Map Minder (Automaton).** Mapping the labyrinthine tunnels and passages of lost ruins is one of the most tedious yet vital jobs of an adventuring party. The map minder is a Small device that measures distances and directions, using parchment and an automated pen to map the surroundings it can see within 60 feet of it. Highly accurate, the map minder all but eliminates the chances of a party losing its way. It can be programmed to utilize special colors and symbols to indicate the location of doors, slopes, traps, and other features.

**Rope Minder (Automaton).** Rope is one of the most indispensable but cumbersome items in an adventurer’s arsenal. A rope minder allows parties to venture into the unknown with a near-unlimited supply of rope and a solid base upon which to secure it. A Medium, quadrupedal cube, the rope master measures about 3 feet to a side and carries inside it a powerful winch outfitted with up to 2,000 feet of sturdy silken rope. Its sharp legs and arcano-mechanical hydraulic system allow the rope minder to scuttle up sheer surfaces and anchor itself in place. The rope minder can then dispense rope to its owners, allowing them to climb or descend.

**Torchbearer (Automaton).** A Tiny clockwork device typically shaped like a dog or cat, the torchbearer functions as a permanent mobile light source. The torchbearer emits a cone of nonmagical bright light from its eyes to a distance of 30 feet, and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The automaton’s owner can use a bonus action to activate the light, dim it, or shut it off entirely. The light shines until it is shut off.

**Trapmaster (Automaton).** The trapmaster is unusual in that it is specifically designed to take damage and remain functional.

Measuring 4 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 2 feet high, it is nothing more than a heavily armored, tracked automaton. The trapmaster can be sent forward to trigger traps, allowing parties to proceed safely.While it is of little use against trapped chests, locks, or other minor hazards, the trapmaster can be a true boon against more powerful traps, as its heavy armor is treated with alchemical substances that grant it resistance to acid, cold, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, and thunder damage, in addition to the normal immunities of a tinker gnome automaton.

Shadow Elf Equipment

**Dark Iron.** Found only in the most lightless depths of the world, dark iron is comparable to adamantine in many respects. Though incredibly durable, the metal has a critical weakness: it dissolves almost instantly in sunlight. Dark iron weapons or armor that spend 1 round in direct sunlight become pitted and obviously worn. A second round causes the item to acquire the broken condition (a broken weapon deals half damage and broken armor provides half its AC bonus, rounded down). A third round

causes the item to disintegrate to nothingness.

**Mycelium Stakes.** These stakes are just as effective at destroying vampires as those made of wood, but they have an additional benefit: when driven into the corpse of a creature, the mycelium in these stakes creates a fungal colony that slowly consumes the corpse, preventing it from returning as an undead. The fungus can consume the corpse of a newly dead creature in 1d6 days, but it works much faster on undead flesh, destroying such remains in a mere 1d4 hours.

**Radiant Trap.** This metal sphere is perforated with dark iron plugs and filled with pressurized holy water. When the sphere is rubbed with glaring oil, takes at least 1 point of radiant damage, or enters an area of natural or magical sunlight, the plugs dissolve, spraying holy water in a

10-foot radius around the trap. Undead and fiends in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 radiant damage on a failed save or half the damage on a success.

**Spider Silk.** This incredibly light and strong cloth is made from woven spider silk. It can be used to create light armor and textiles. Cloth and rope made from spider silk has twice the usual number of hit points, and the AC and the DC to break spider silk rope

increases by 2. The difficulty of weaving with spider silk accounts for its high price.

**Spiderweb Bomb.** A creature can use an action to throw the bomb up to 30 feet at a point it can see. When it lands, the bomb detonates into a mass of sticky webs in a 10-foot radius. If there are at least two solid surfaces within 10 feet of the bomb, the strands adhere to them, creating a lightly obscured area of difficult terrain. The webs dissolve after 30 minutes. A creature in the bomb’s detonation radius or that enters the area while the webs remain must make a DC 12 Dexterity save or be restrained. A restrained creature can escape the webs by using its action to make a DC 14 Strength check. Each 5-foot cube section of the webs can be hacked through (AC 11, 12 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage) or burned. A creature restrained by the webs when the webs are burned takes 2d4 fire damage.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Material** | **Description** | **Cost** | **Properties** | **Repairability** |
| Dark Iron | Comparable to adamantine in its physical characteristics, dark iron is an inky black metal with a faint purplish iridescence. | ×4 | Hardy, lightweight | Repair DC 25 smith’s tools, access to a forge |
| Spider Silk | Spider silk is the spun webbing of giant spiders. It is incredibly light and strong. It can be used to make light armor. | 800 gp + 10 ×  the usual price of the item | Comfortable, fortified | Repair DC 25 (sewing kit) |

Material Properties

***Comfortable.*** Armor with this property is comfortable enough to sleep in without penalty.

***Fortified.*** Fortified armor increases the Armor Class it grants by 1.

***Hardy.*** While wearing hardy armor, the first critical hit against you since your last short rest becomes a normal hit. You cannot use this feature again until you make adjustments to the armor during a short or long rest.

***Lightweight.*** If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the lightweight version of the armor doesn’t.

## Dungeon Mounts

While horses are poorly suited to dungeons and caverns, dungeon denizens tame and ride many other creatures. Besides mules and mastiffs, which can thrive as underground mounts, the following creatures can be used as mounts by those who can tame them. Their riders gain the advantage of their different forms of movement.

| Giant Toad | 200 gp | 20 ft., swim 40 ft. | 420 lbs. | 14 |

#### Dungeon Vehicles

Underland boasts many of the same vehicles that ply surface roads and seas. Shadow elf couriers use giant spider-drawn chariots, and galleys sail the Midnight Sea. Safe from inclement weather, airships fly through mammoth caverns and miles-long ravines.

A few vehicles are unique to the Underland. Aboleth-built submarines ferry treasure and thralls to underwater cities. Armed with torpedoes, aboleth submarines fight a never ending war against the fleets of sunless mariners.

\* Torpedoes can fire only through water. They cannot be launched above the surface.

Special Feature

***Submersible.*** Submersible vehicles seal themselves and travel safely below the surface of the water, providing sufficient air and pressure protection to keep their crew safe from the hazards of undersea travel. They can move in three dimensions underwater or travel along the water’s surface.

#### Shocking Grasp rare spell: Amber Prince’s Shocking Grasp

*Cantrip (evocation; affliction, arcane, attack, lightning)*

**Classes:** Sorcerer, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet

**Target:** 1 creature **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

Electricity arcs from your hand to shock the target. Make a ranged spell attack (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal). On a hit, you deal 1d8 lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn as the electricity courses through its body.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Antimagic Zone

*9th-level (abjuration; arcane, divine, negation, planar, protection)* **Classes:** Cleric, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Area:** 10-foot cube

**Components:** V, S, M (opal worth at least 1,000 gp, consumed by the spell) **Duration:** Permanent until dispelled

A permanent, immovable zone of antimagic fills the area, suppressing all magical effects within it. At the Narrator’s discretion, sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the zone’s effects.

The zone is dispelled only if more than 10 percent of its area overlaps with that of another *antimagic zone* spell (which is also dispelled).

**Area Suppression:** When a magical effect protrudes into the zone, that part of the effect’s area is suppressed. For example, the ice created by a *wall of ice* is suppressed within the zone, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.

**Creatures and Objects:** While within the zone, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic temporarily wink out of existence, reappearing immediately once the space they occupied is no longer within the zone.

**Dispel Magic:** The sphere is immune to *dispel magic* and similar magical effects, including *antimagic field* spells.

**Magic Items:** While within the zone, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the zone.

**Magical Travel:** Whether the zone includes a destination or departure point, any planar travel or teleportation within it automatically fails. Until the spell ends or the zone moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a *bag of holding*) within the zone are closed.

**Spells:** Any spell cast within the zone or at a target within the zone is suppressed and the spell slot is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within the zone. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent suppressed counts against it.

#### Arcane Mirror

*4th-level (divination; arcane, communication, divine, scrying, utility)* **Classes:** Bard, cleric, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Target:** A mirror on the same plane of existence as you

**Components:** V, S, M (mirror worth at least 500 gold)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

You choose a mirror you’ve seen on the same plane of existence as you. You create

a scrying sensor inside that mirror. You can instead name an area, such as a specific building or city: you create a scrying sensor inside a random mirror within that area. If there is no mirror in the area, the spell fails.

You can see and hear from the mirror as if you were within it. If there is at least one creature within sight of the mirror when you cast the spell, you can take control of that creature’s reflection in the mirror. You can cause the reflection to act as you wish and to speak. Apart from the reflection’s appearance in the mirror and the words it speaks, it has no effect on the real world.

#### Awaken Portal

*4th-level (transmutation; arcane, architecture, divine, protection)* **Classes:** Bard, cleric, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Target:** Huge or smaller door or window **Components:** V, S, M (gold key worth at least 250 gp, consumed by the spell) **Duration:** Until dispelled

You impart sentience to a door, window, gate, lid, or other object that can be opened, closed, and locked. You grant it an Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma of 10. The door retains its hit points, AC, and other characteristics, and is considered an object. If the door is reduced to 0 hit points, it is killed and the spell ends.

The door is able to open, close, lock, and unlock by itself, and can speak and understand one language that you know. If *arcane lock* is cast on the door, the door can activate and deactivate the spell at will. The door is friendly to you and follows your orders.

#### Conjure Aberration

*6th-level (conjuration: arcane, divine, evil, planar, summoning)*

**Classes:** Cleric, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Medium (60 feet)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration (1 hour) You wrench open a hole in reality and summon a creature from the cracks

between the planes. This creature uses the statistics of a conjured aberration (detailed below). In addition, roll 1d4 or choose the aberration’s general appearance.

1. Squid-like
2. Writhing ball of body parts
3. Humanoid with featureless face
4. Translucent worm

The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only defends itself. The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the aberration, which becomes hostile and attacks you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** For each slot level above 5th, the aberration’s AC increases by 1, its hit points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra damage.

***Rare: Vornift’s Ecstatic Conjure Aberration.*** The conjured aberration has an additional 20 hit points and its attacks deal an additional 2d4 damage. However, when you first conjure it, you must immediately succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or lose control of the aberration.

**CONJURED ABERRATION** Challenge — LARGE ABERRATION

**AC** 13 (natural armor)

**HP** 90 (bloodied 45)

**Speed** 30 ft., fly 30 ft. (hover), swim 30 ft.

ACTIONS

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack bonus to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus extra damage equal to spell slot level. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (your spell save DC to escape).

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack bonus to hit, reach 5 ft., one target grappled by the aberration. *Hit:* 25 (6d6 + 4) piercing damage plus extra damage equal to spell slot level.

#### Escape

*5th-level (conjuration; arcane, teleportation)*

**Classes:** Bard, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 10 feet

**Target:** You and up to 5 willing creatures **Components:** V, S, M (silken cord) **Duration:** Instantaneous

If you cast this spell while underground or inside a building, you teleport to the outdoor space you occupied most recently within the last 24 hours. You are teleported whether or not the destination is hazardous.

The spell fails if there is 100 contiguous feet of earth or stone or a thin layer of lead in a direct line between you and the destination.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** For each spell slot above 5th, you can teleport two additional creatures along with you.

#### Invisible Object

*3rd-level (illusion; arcane, obscurement, shadow)*

**Classes:** Bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch **Target:** One object **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 1 hour

A Medium or smaller object becomes invisible, as do any inanimate contents inside it when the spell is cast. Objects removed from the spell’s original target become visible. Objects placed in or on the target after the spell is cast remain visible, and dirt, dust, and other markings may reveal the invisible object’s location. The spell ends if the object deals damage.

Attacks made with an invisible melee weapon are made with advantage.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** When cast with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 day. When cast with a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is permanent until dispelled.

#### Magic Map

*2nd-level (divination; arcane, knowledge, nature)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid, warlock, wizard **Casting Time:** 1 action (ritual) **Range:** Short (30 feet)

**Area:** Special

**Components:** S, M (blank parchment and special inks worth at least 25 gp, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a map with yourself at the center, or update a map previously created with this spell. When creating a map, you choose its scale, from 100 by 100 feet to 100 by 100 miles. As part of the spell, you can make notes or other annotations on the map. The map only includes locations that you’ve seen and traveled through. The map doesn’t show areas at a significantly different elevation from your current location. If you cast the spell while you are lost, the spell fails.

At the Narrator’s discretion, some magical areas can’t be mapped with this spell.

#### Metabolic Stasis

*6th-level (transmutation; arcane, divine, nature, negation)*

**Classes:** Bard, cleric, wizard **Casting Time:** 10 minutes **Range:** Short (30 feet) **Area:** 50-foot cube

**Components:** S, M (diamond-dust-filled hourglass worth at least 1,000 gp, consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

Creatures in the area when the spell is cast no longer age or require sustenance or Supply. The effect ends for a creature the first time it leaves the area.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** When cast with an 8th-level spell slot, affected creatures no longer need to breathe.

#### Ravaging Roots

*6th-level (evocation; arcane, earth, nature, plants)*

**Classes:** Druid, sorcerer **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** 30-foot square

**Components:** V, S, M (dried willow tree root)

**Duration:** Concentration (1 minute)

Roots erupt out of an earth or stone surface that you can see within range, swelling as they smash stone and displace earth. When the spell ends, the roots wither away, but the damage remains.

**Creatures:** A creature that starts its turn in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw or is restrained by the roots, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature already restrained by the roots automatically fails this saving throw. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself or another creature on a success.

**Ground:** Ground and floors in the area (and underneath ceilings in the area, if you cast the spell on a ceiling) become difficult terrain.

**Walls and Ceilings:** Constructed walls and ceilings in the area take 5d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns while the spell lasts. A structure reduced to 0 hit points by this spell collapses. Most structures of worked stone have around 27 (5d10) hit points per

10-foot-square section, while natural walls and ceilings have half as many hit points.

When a wall or ceiling collapses, the spell ends early. Each creature in or directly beneath the spell’s area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried by rubble. A creature buried by rubble that is underground is also unable to breathe. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself or another creature on a success.

#### Skeletal Hands

*1st-level (necromancy; arcane, control, divine, necrotic)*

**Classes:** Cleric, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Short (30 feet) **Target:** 1 creature

**Components:** S, M (finger bone) **Duration:** Concentration (1 minute) Dozens of skeletal hands reach from a wall or other vertical surface to grasp a creature within 5 feet of the surface. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and is restrained until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the hands can use a bonus action to make a

Strength saving throw to escape, ending the spell early on a success. On a failure, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage. When the spell ends, the hands withdraw into the wall.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** The spell’s initial damage and damage on a failed escape

attempt increase by 1d8 per slot level above 1st.

***Rare: Finor’s Imprisoning Skeletal Hands.*** If you maintain concentration on the spell for the full duration, the target remains trapped by the hands until the magic is dispelled or you dismiss the spell as an action.

#### Stonesense

*3rd-level (divination; arcane, divine, earth, nature)*

**Classes:** Cleric, druid, paladin, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch **Target:** 1 creature

**Components:** V, S, M (a rough figure of an earth elemental)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You imbue the target with a preternatural understanding of stone. The target gains tremorsense out to a distance of 60 feet.

Whenever the target makes a History check related to the origin of stonework, it is considered proficient in the History skill and gains an expertise die on the check. If the target already has the Stonecunning trait, it makes the check with advantage.

Additionally, if the target is underground, it can make a DC 10 Intelligence check to correctly determine the distance between itself and the surface, or to perfectly recall any path it has traveled in the past week.

#### Thunderbolt

*4th-level (evocation; arcane, attack, nature, sound, storm, thunder)*

**Classes:** Bard, druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Long (120 feet) **Area:** 20-foot-radius sphere

**Components:** V, S, M (tiny sheet of metal)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Saving Throw:** Dexterity halves and negates deafness

A peal of thunder ripples from a point you can see within range. Each creature in the area takes 8d6 thunder damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. If the area contains Large or larger nonmagical wood or stone objects, the objects take 8d6 thunder damage and creatures in the area that fail their saving throw take an additional 2d6 slashing damage from flying splinters. The thunderclap can be heard from 600 feet away.

***Cast at Higher Levels.*** For every slot level above 3rd, the thunder and slashing damage increase by 1d6, and the thunderclap can be heard from an additional 100 feet away.

***Rare: Elvatar’s Thunderous Entrance.*** After the spell deals damage, you can teleport to the center of the area.

# Building a Dungeon

Dungeon Theme Mundane Dungeons Ancient Dungeons

While some dungeons are bustling with monsters, others are old and uninhabited (or contain uninhabited sections). Unless there’s a magical effect preserving a dungeon in a pristine state, organic materials rot and metals degrade over time. You can use the following guidelines to evoke the sense of the passage of time in your dungeon. Most dungeons are fairly well-sealed against weather, so decay is slow. In a wet environment, objects can decay ten times faster; in an unusually dry environment, objects can last ten times as long.

After 20 years, corpses turn to skeletons. Unsealed foodstuffs rot.

After 200 years, paper and parchment yellows. Cloth and leather look worn. Copper develops a green patina and silver a black tarnish. Iron and steel can become discolored and spotted with rust. Sealed and preserved foods and drinks, such as wine, may spoil.

After 2,000 years, only fragments of paper and parchment survive. Cloth and leather have rotted away. Copper is coated with a green or black patina, and silver is black with tarnish. Pure gold remains bright,

though gold alloys may darken. Steel and iron are brown with rust. Stone, glass, pottery, and bones remain well-preserved.

Mundane Dungeon Themes

The most common types of mundane dungeons are bastions, laboratories, mines, ruins, sewers, temples, tombs, and the caverns of Underland.

**Bastions** run the gamut from gleaming citadels to traditional prison dungeons to simple bandit lairs. An active bastion dungeon is well-patrolled and features only a few entrances and exits (some of which may be hidden).

A **laboratory** is any place used for magical research. Wizards are most commonly associated with laboratories, but any spellcasting class—and even

non-spellcasters such as alchemists and sages—might use a laboratory. A laboratory is a place of experiment and knowledge and typically includes workrooms, classrooms, and libraries. More often than not, a laboratory also contains magical guardians and spell effects unique to that location.

A **mine** holds, or once held, valuable ore, gemstones, or more esoteric magical resources. Dwarves, humans, deep gnomes, and kobolds are traditionally miners.

The past inhabitants of a **ruin** are more important than the current ones. A ruin might house intelligent inhabitants, but no one group dominates the dungeon: large sections of it are abandoned to time or unintelligent monsters, such as undead, or unliving guardians like constructs. Most areas haven’t been used since the original inhabitants left. Depending on the ruin’s age, surfaces might be dusty or moldy; wood and cloth might have rotted away; and

metals might be rusty, tarnished, or covered with patina.

Traversable **sewers** may not have been terribly common in real medieval cities, but vaulted sewers like those in

18th-century Paris are a fantasy trope for a reason. Sewers provide a private highway for thieves and a ready-made dungeon beneath every major city. They can be home to amphibious threats like aboleths, hidden menaces like cultists and assassins, and the occasional hapless guard patrol.

Like mines, they tend to be high-tech, with pumps and water locks.

A **temple** can vary wildly depending on its inhabitants. A religious abbey, sanctioned by the local government, looks very different from a hidden shrine inhabited by evil cultists. In either case, small chapels and the central worship area will display all the wealth and magnificence the local priests can muster. Holy relics are protected by magical or mundane means

Many adventures hinge on quests to recover lost relics, which as often as not end up in **tombs**. A tomb’s defenses rely on traps and, of course, the dungeon’s undead occupants.

**Cavern** systems in general, and the vast network of caves called Underland in particular, were created by geological forces, not intelligently designed. The deepest caves are often the most dangerous.

#### Mythic Dungeon

Mythic dungeons are designed more to engender a specific experience than to simulate a realistic location.

Presented roughly from most supernatural to most natural, here are some rationales for a mythic dungeon:

* The dungeon is a dreamland that operates on its own principles.
* A mad wizard did it.
* The dungeon itself is alive and has specific abilities like changing its own layout and summoning monsters. The dungeon is aware of and hostile to the characters.
* The adventurers are on an alternate plane of existence with its own learnable rules, or at a planar junction between two planes. A dungeon in the Dreaming will contain fey creatures and feature bargains and promises. A planar junction with the Far Realms might include melting architecture, sloppy slime that sprouts eyes and tentacles, and twisted and horrific inhabitants.
* The adventurers are in an area that’s under a specific set of spell effects or monster abilities that follow all the rules of the game (operating as expected with *detect magic*, *dispel magic*, and so on).

Bonus points if the effects are well-known and available to the players, like *guards and wards*, *programmed illusion,* and so on.

Mythic Dungeon Rules

When building a mythic dungeon, among the most important design elements are the dungeon’s unique rules that set it apart from other subterranean places. The following example rules can be used to change the tone of your dungeon. You can even combine several rules in the same dungeon.

Each mythic dungeon rule comes with an optional non-supernatural explanation, such as its affinity with a certain plane of existence, or the net effect

of vast quantities of magical stone used to build the dungeon. If you want your dungeon to be a solvable mystery, you can allow characters to discover these explanations. If you want your dungeon to be a dreamlike space, you don’t need the explanation.

**Dungeon Rules and Challenge Rating**: In mythic dungeons, rules generally only penalize visitors to the area, including the adventurers. Permanent inhabitants are not affected by the rules’ negative effects. If one or more rules makes a battle harder for the adventurers, increase the Challenge Rating of the encounter by 1.

Adventurers can exploit this effect. If adventurers adopt a mythic dungeon as a home base, they can eventually come to ignore the negative effects of the dungeons’ supernatural rules (seeing normally in Darkest Dark, for instance). If the adventurers use this to gain an advantage in a battle against invading monsters, lower the encounter’s CR by 1.

**Clockwork Dungeon.** Within the dungeon, objects reset when the adventurers aren’t present. Doors re-lock themselves, sprung traps reset, levers return to their original position, and so on. This rule is useful for a deathtrap dungeon that has confounded numerous intruders over its history, such as a demilich’s lair. It’s good for fostering an uneasy sense that the adventurers are being watched and countered by hostile forces.

**Explanation:** Clockwork devices, reloading gremlins, small constructs like *animated objects*, and intelligent inhabitants can reset devices when the adventurers aren’t looking.

**Darkest Dark.** In this dungeon, places that would be areas of dim light are instead dark, and bright light is instead dim. Furthermore, visitors’ darkvision doesn’t work in such dungeons. This dungeon rule is good for fostering claustrophobic dread and also for imposing logistical considerations on the party. In a darkest-dark dungeon, someone needs to bring a light source—preferably multiple someones, since a torch’s 20-foot radius of light won’t let the characters see very far.

**Explanations:** The dungeon might be in or near the plane of shadow.

**Dungeon of Chaos.** The layout of a chaos dungeon changes periodically—perhaps every week or month. Passages, chambers, or even entire levels appear and disappear, and mazes re-route themselves when no one is looking. When new dungeon areas appear, new monsters, obstacles, and treasures appear as well. Who made all these changes to the dungeon? Who knows?

A chaos dungeon defies efforts to map or conquer it. A place without predictable rules, it forces players to accept the strange and novel as a standard part of the environment. A chaos dungeon provides the perfect excuse for an eternally fresh megadungeon, where every chamber contains new challenges for the characters to overcome, even when the characters revisit them.

**Explanation:** The dungeon might be connected to some source of chaos magic or a chaos plane. The dungeon itself might be alive, rerouting itself to repel (or lure in) adventurers who seek to claim it. Other dungeon rules, like Eternal Menagerie and Darkest Dark, might apply to a living dungeon, as well. On the other hand, a living dungeon’s ever-changing layout may

be a completely mechanical affair, with machine-driven walls that reconfigure themselves on a periodic schedule.

**Eternal Menagerie.** The inhabitants of this dungeon don’t seem to age or require food or water. An Eternal Menagerie lends itself to dungeons whose only purpose is to challenge the characters with a dizzying array of opponents, possibly as some sort of magical gauntlet or proving ground.

**Explanation:** The menagerie might be the creation of a powerful creature like a sphinx or archfey. Alternatively, the dungeon might be made of an arcane stone called bluestone, which slows the passage of time nearby, or it might be close to the Plane of Time, a reality in which all times collide.

**Evil Dungeon.** Within this dungeon, undead and fiends make saving throws with advantage. Furthermore, magical healing is reduced: whenever a spell or magical effect would allow a creature to regain hit points, that creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or the spell has no effect. An evil dungeon can make an adventuring party feel decidedly unwelcome. If the characters venture inside in pursuit of an evil creature like a vampire or demon, they can easily find themselves turning from the hunters to the hunted. This rule gives a strong boost to undead and fiendish creatures, making them far less likely to be affected by effects such as *banishment* and Turn Undead. It may be worth adding more than +1 to the Challenge Rating of encounters with undead or fiendish monsters.

**Explanation:** The area might be the cursed sanctum of an unholy temple or lie on a dangerous plane of existence.

**No Long Rests.** Within this dungeon, sleep is troubled by bad dreams and offers little comfort. While long rests are still necessary to prevent exhaustion, they give only the benefits of short rests. This dungeon rule prevents characters from using game elements that provide havens. It creates a timer for a dungeon, forcing creatures to complete its challenges without the benefit of refreshed spell slots or other abilities that recharge on a long rest. This rule can be particularly dangerous and should be used with caution. If players can neither escape nor rest when they’re out of resources, they may become trapped.

**Explanation:** The dungeon walls are made of a disturbing arcane stone called dreamstone, or the area is suffused with the corruption of the Far Realm.

Alternatively, long rests can be prevented by adding a time limit to dungeon exploration.

**No Teleportation.** Within certain areas of the dungeon, visitors can’t teleport, plane shift, or access extradimensional spaces like *bags of holding*. At high character levels, this rule is almost a necessity for dungeons in which the Narrator wants to control the characters’ access to certain areas or prevent easy escape.

**Explanation:** The dungeon walls are carved from holystone, an arcane stone that prevents teleportation. Alternatively, the walls are covered with phase crystals.

**Unfriendly Doors.** For visitors, the DC to break or pick locked doors increases by 10. Inhabitants of the dungeon can pass through doors without a key. This dungeon rule is good for creating puzzle mazes in which finding the proper key or password for each door is an important part of the challenge.

**Explanation:** Every locked door is affected by *arcane lock*. It can be dispelled as normal.

## Stocking the Dungeon

#### The NODES System

Most locations in a dungeon are physical nodes. Every room or corridor with multiple exits is an intersection of paths. More broadly, every place of interest is a story node, where characters make one choice or another.

NODES is also a mnemonic you can use to populate your dungeon rooms with entertaining variety. Your dungeon comes alive when it’s filled with **Novelties**, **Obstacles**, **Discoveries**, **Escalations**, and **Set-pieces**.

When designing a dungeon, stock most of your rooms with items from the NODES checklist. Fill other rooms with theme-supporting scenery and logistical necessities like barracks. You don’t need to hit everything in the checklist, especially in a smaller dungeon. A larger or themed dungeon can have multiples of a single type of node: a death trap could be made of mostly trap obstacles with few or no combat encounters, and a campaign-defining megadungeon might have multiple factions, bosses, sub-bosses, and puzzles on each of its floors.

#### Novelties

Novelty is the driving force of tabletop RPGs. Every dungeon should offer something that the players haven’t seen before in the campaign, or a twist on a familiar idea.

One of the best ways to introduce novelty into your game is with a fantastic vista.

* **Grand scale.** Dungeons are usually cramped, and it’s nice to give breathing room to an important area by placing it against a huge backdrop. Give your players a view of vast caverns, endless corridors, subterranean oceans, and towering spires.
* **Dizzying depths.** Chasms are great, especially when spanned by narrow bridges. What’s at the bottom? Blackness? Twinkling lights of unknown origin? Glowing lava?
* **Light.** Darkness is the default state underground, which makes light an even more effective tool. Bright, colored lights are a great aid to the imagination. Fill rooms with phosphorescent moss, glowing crystals, blazing braziers, dancing motes of fairy light, or stranger light sources like strobing lightning flashes from an underground storm, or the distant, burning skeleton of an immense giant. Large, bright spaces are especially welcome after long journeys through dark, constricted tunnels.
* **Violation of natural laws**. Examples include Escher-like altered gravity, with furniture, stairs, and doors on the walls and ceiling; objects slowed or frozen in time, like unmoving torch flames; underground wilderness, such as forests; weather, such as snow or mist; and spell effects, like *fly* and *detect thoughts*, applied to all who enter. Mythic dungeon rules, such as Darkest Dark and Dungeon of Chaos, also apply here.
* **Art.** Memorable, large-scale artwork, such as tapestries, carvings, and statues, are a dungeon classic for a

reason (particularly statues, which can also be monsters in their own right or signs of nearby medusas). Magical artwork, like illusions, can be even more spectacular. The most memorable dungeon art is the most unsettling! Why is there a mosaic of a hero being devoured by stirges, or a statue of a creepy clown whose juggling balls are suspended motionless in the air?

* + **Strange materials.** Dungeons or dungeon sections made of bones, stained glass, flesh, or walls of force.

Not every novelty has to be visually impressive! Here are some less photogenic novelties that can spice up a dungeon:

* + Travel by teleporter
  + A dungeon populated by ghosts from the characters’ past
  + A regular, repeating noise, such as an echoing crash, the grinding of stone, or sinister giggling
  + Claustrophobic or underwater tunnels
  + Timed elements, such as dungeon levels that can only be reached at low tide
  + Unusual architecture: odd-shaped or tilted rooms, balconies or bridges looking down on other levels.

#### Obstacles

Obstacles are non-combat challenges that block the way forward. They may require characters to think critically, pay a cost, or even retrace their steps and come back later. The most common types of obstacles are **locks**, **puzzles**, and **traps**.

Every obstacle should allow multiple solutions. Consider what happens to the adventure if the players don’t think of a

puzzle’s clever solution. They should be able to bypass it or use brute force to solve it, usually at a cost.

#### Discoveries

In the NODES dungeon framework, “obstacles” and “discoveries”—problems and solutions—often go hand in hand. A discovery is something that makes traversing the dungeon easier or is a reward for its own sake, like treasure. The most common types of discoveries are **keys**, **treasure**, **social interaction**, and **secrets**.

A **key** is anything that allows the characters to progress past an obstacle elsewhere in a dungeon. Most often it’s a literal key, but it can also take the form of a password, a magic medallion that dispels a *wall of force*, or even a disguise that allows passage through a guarded door.

**Treasure** often takes the form of a traditional, level-appropriate treasure hoard, but it’s useful to grant smaller amounts of treasure as well.

Many parties value **secrets** as much as or more than wealth. Just as people keep watching television dramas for the steady stream of plot twists, an RPG adventure is more engaging when it offers mysteries and revelations.

Even players that prefer fighting and puzzle-solving might find that non-combat **social interactions** breathe life into a dungeon. An adventure’s stakes are always heightened if it includes NPCs that the party cares about.

| 11 | **Map.** A map of this dungeon or another dungeon level; directions to |

#### Escalation

Escalation demonstrates and heightens the danger of the dungeon. In an escalation scene, players discover that defeat is closer than they realized.

Combat Escalation

By far the most common type of escalation is an encounter with hostile creatures. A combat encounter drains hit points, spell slots, and other resources; can signal entry into a more dangerous area; and, if enemies escape or sound the alarm, can lead to a raised alert level throughout the dungeon.

Non-combat Escalation

Non-combat escalation can include failing a Stealth roll and setting off an alarm, becoming aware of a time limit, entering a more dangerous area, or spending resources.

While traps are usually classified as obstacles, elite traps can be used to escalate tension. Like a puzzle, a normal trap can slow down the pace as players figure out how to navigate it safely. An elite trap, on the other hand, is an active threat that attacks over several rounds: it functions more like a combat than a puzzle. When players get locked in a room that slowly fills with water, or are forced to flee from a rolling boulder, they discover that the dungeon is more dangerous than they had realized.

The Escalation Clock

You can manage the pacing of the dungeon adventure without tracking the dungeon’s

escalation level. You can do this by feel, having things generally get harder as the adventure goes on. You can also track a literal escalation level over the course of the adventure, using a countdown dice pool with a pool of 4 dice to measure a bastion’s alert level or the time left until the evil cultists’ ritual is complete. As the countdown advances, each combat encounter includes extra monsters, or a monster is replaced with a tougher one. When the countdown reaches zero, the dungeon’s toughest monsters come looking for the adventurers!

When you track escalation, the dungeon grows more dangerous the longer the players explore it. Whenever they spend time resting, engage in combat, or leave signs of their presence, the dungeon responds. If you’re tracking escalation level, you may wish to have random checks for monsters every few game minutes or every time the players take a rest. Roll a d20 and add the current number of dice in the countdown dice pool, with a random encounter occurring on a result of 1–6. Or you can create a custom table of

dungeon-specific effects that occur at each escalation level.

Escalation Rewards

While an escalation scene doesn’t always lead to a reward, it often grants incidental treasure. When players defeat foes or disarm an elite trap, you can grant incidental treasure or roll on the Discoveries table.

#### Set Pieces

While an escalation scene offers a glimpse of danger, a set piece is a battle, chase, or other action scene with a real chance of failure. It’s often the climactic scene in a dungeon or dungeon level, and success

often means the characters have reached their goal. For instance, triumphing in a set piece battle might allow characters to descend to the next level of the dungeon (or escape it), defeat the evil creatures menacing the area, or free the prisoners they are searching for.

Set Piece Rewards

A set piece encounter usually guards a major reward like a treasure hoard. If the set piece is a combat encounter, determine the contents of the treasure hoard ahead of the battle. Many intelligent foes are able to use magic weapons and other items against the party.

#### Dungeon Scenery

The NODES checklist is useful for the dungeon as a whole, but not every room needs to contain a risk, a reward, or a never-before-seen wonder! Some contain the prosaic living areas needed to make the dungeon work as a habitation. Bedrooms, kitchens, and the like might house monsters and hide treasure, but they might just be themselves.

As a general rule, you can stock 25 to 50 percent of dungeon rooms with theme-supporting scenery (shrines in a temple, burial niches in a tomb, etc).

## Running the Dungeon

When players first enter an area, describe elements roughly in order of importance. You can use the mnemonic DICE to organize the area’s description.

* **Description:** A *brief* room description should come first,

because it lets the players mentally place everything that comes next. One to three words—“kitchen,” “wide hallway,” “big throne room,”—are enough to start. Unless mapping is very important to the game, room dimensions can be described later, or not at all.

* **Inhabitants:** In most cases—especially if they’re trying to kill the characters—the creatures in the room are its most important feature.
* **Contents:** Only mention important features the characters can interact with or investigate, such as chests, levers, a pit filled with purple flame, and so on. It’s vital that you mention any feature that might be trapped or hazardous.
* **Exits:** Knowing where the exits are isn’t as important as what’s in the room, but they should be mentioned once you’ve described the area’s more relevant features.

When you’ve run through this list, you may have left many room elements unmentioned! Players get a better sense of an area if they actively ask questions about it, rather than trying to focus on a long monologue. Players should be able to discover every element in the room by asking questions about things mentioned in your initial room description.

# Traps

The traps presented here are **exploration challenges**. The exact size and placement of a trap is up to the Narrator. Each trap uses the following format:

**Tier.** A trap of a specific tier is most suitable for characters in that tier. For example, second-tier traps are challenges for characters of level 5 through 10.

**Challenge.** A trap with a challenge rating equal to the party’s level is usually a suitable challenge. You can heighten or reduce the danger by using a trap with a challenge rating 50 percent higher or lower than the party’s level. Outside of this range, a trap might be too difficult or too trivial.

**DC.** Unless noted elsewhere, all ability checks and saving throws use the trap’s DC. Each trap has two DCs separated by a slash; the first is for a check by a single character, and the second is for group checks. If you wish, you can also use the group check DC if several characters take different actions to disable an elite trap during the same round.

**XP.** The XP the characters receive for overcoming the trap. Disabling or avoiding a trap without a die roll (through a spell or action that automatically succeeds) or by scoring a Critical Success on a check grants the trap’s full XP. Partially overcoming a trap, or doing so with one or more Successes but no Critical Successes, or failing to disarm a trap and suffering its full effects, grants half the trap’s XP.

**Trap Description.** An italicized description of the trap’s appearance. You can read or paraphrase this description to the players, or you can vary the description to match the trap’s specifics. In any case, each trap’s

description should telegraph the trap’s presence and list important elements the characters can investigate further.

**Trap Features.** A list of the trap’s key features, along with the ability checks characters can make to learn further information about them.

**Possible Solutions** Most traps allow a character to make an ability check, or occasionally an attack roll, to bypass or disarm the trap. Unless otherwise noted, a successful check triggers the trap’s Success, Critical Success, Failure, or Critical Failure conditions (see below). The most obvious skill uses are listed under Possible Solutions, but players may think of other skills to use, as well.

Some traps list no Possible Solutions: there is no obvious way to defeat such a trap with an ability check. It must either be defeated with specific spells or actions (see below) or avoided altogether. Traps like this might be missing Success or Failure conditions as well.

**Critical Failure.** The listed effect occurs when a creature triggers the trap’s Critical Failure, usually by failing an ability check by 5 or more or by rolling a 1 on a check while trying to solve the trap. A group check in which all the characters fail also triggers a Critical Failure.

**Failure.** The listed effect occurs when an attempt to disable or avoid a trap results in a failure.

**Success.** The listed effect occurs when an attempt to disable or avoid a trap results in a success.

**Critical Success.** The listed effect occurs when a creature triggers the trap’s Critical Success, usually by succeeding on an ability check by 5 or more or by rolling a 20 on a check. A group check in which all

the characters succeed also triggers a Critical Success.

A Critical Success usually disables a trap. On a Critical Success, you can also allow adventurers to bypass a trap but leave it active (to hide evidence of their passing or to slow down pursuit).

#### Searching an Area

Players can search for traps, hazards, and other dangers in different ways. One player might ask questions about what their character sees, hears, and smells. Another might describe their character taking specific actions, such as tapping the walls or floors. Some players use spells and class features to discover threats, while others make ability checks (or rely on their Passive Perception score) to examine their surroundings. All these approaches are valid and can be used in concert. The best traps can be discovered and disarmed using multiple strategies.

#### Exploration

Ability checks are tools players can use to learn more about a trap. For instance, a successful Investigation or Perception check against a trap’s DC reveals the hidden pressure plate that activates the trap.

Generally, an Intelligence or Wisdom check doesn’t trigger a trap or result in a Success or Failure. For instance, recalling lore about a cursed altar might require a History check, while a successful Perception check reveals a clue carved into the altar’s base. Such a check doesn’t activate the altar’s magic; it merely provides information or it doesn’t.

The exception to this is an Investigation check. Unless a player specifies otherwise, an Investigation check involves approaching, examining, and moving objects. If such activities could be dangerous, failing an Investigation check triggers the trap’s Failure or Critical Failure conditions. To compensate for these risks, Investigation offers greater rewards. A successful Investigation check can uncover clues that can’t be found in other ways (such as revealing a key hidden in a drawer or a trap door concealed beneath a carpet).

A character can also use tools and a steady hand to search for clues. When appropriate, allow a character proficient in thieves’ tools to make an ability check with their thieves’ tools as an alternative to making an Investigation check.

If a player says “I search the area” but doesn’t offer specifics, treat this as an Investigation check made to inspect every feature in the area. Normally, a failure on such a search triggers a trap’s Failure condition (the character brushes a tripwire while inspecting the floor, for instance).

However, if the character takes appropriate precautions while investigating (“I cast *levitate* and search the area from three feet up”), they can sometimes avoid such Failures.

Once a character has failed a search check, they’ve learned all they can about the area and can’t search with that ability again until the situation changes.

#### Solving a Trap with Spells and Other Actions

Many traps can be bypassed or disabled without a check.

A trap’s description specifies actions and spells that let a creature automatically avoid a trap’s dangers. Players might also

think of other ways to bypass a trap. Based on how appropriate the solution is, you can decide that it doesn’t work, requires a check, or automatically succeeds.

Sometimes certain elements of a trap can be destroyed. Many trap elements are objects with a listed Armor Class and hit points. When a character attacks an object without these stats, you can decide whether the object is vulnerable to attacks.

Sometimes, attacking a trap element without destroying it outright triggers the trap!

Many traps can be discovered and disabled with magic. *Find traps* and *detect magic* provide information about all sorts of traps, and most magical traps can be disabled (or at least suppressed) with *dispel magic* and *antimagic field*. Many other spells can be used to circumvent or disable traps. Some of these solutions are listed in the trap’s description; you can adjudicate others as they arise.

#### Traps as Combatants

A trap can be combined with a combat encounter. If it’s likely to be triggered during the battle, add the trap’s challenge rating to the encounter as if it were a combatant.

#### Elite Traps

An elite trap functions like a combat encounter. It typically poses a threat to multiple characters for multiple rounds. Just as an elite monster is twice as dangerous as a standard monster of its challenge rating, an elite trap can threaten and test every member of the party.

While it's possible to disable or circumvent an elite trap through clever play alone, more commonly the characters must spend several turns using ability checks,

attack rolls, and spells to overcome such traps. A sufficiently dangerous elite trap can even act as a dungeon set piece, such as a gallery filled with scything blades that guards an archmage’s sanctum or lich’s treasure vault.

When combining an elite trap with a combat encounter, treat the trap as two normal traps of its challenge rating.

#### Creating Traps

When creating a trap, decide how it is triggered and what happens when it activates. Once activated, the trap might target one or more creatures, or an entire area. The trap might make an attack roll, or the affected creatures might be forced to make a saving throw.

Think of several ways that the trap could be foiled, using checks, tool uses, spells, and other actions.

Finally, create a clue, hint, or significant detail that alerts observant players that something might be amiss before the trap activates.

Most elite traps call for an initiative roll and require some combination of successful ability checks, attack rolls, or other actions to deactivate. Decide what initiative count the trap acts on. Elite traps grant twice as many experience points as a standard trap of their challenge rating. An elite trap usually targets most or all of the creatures in the area. An elite trap that deals damage each round uses the Multiple-Target Damage column; one that deals damage once, like a Crushing Room Trap, uses the Single-Target Damage column.

**List of Traps**

Acid Bucket Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*A faint, acrid smell wafts through the half-open door.*

A bucket filled with acid balances precariously on top of the door. Opening the door triggers a Critical Failure.

***Exploration.*** A Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals pockmarks where the acid has eaten away the stone (or, if the Narrator prefers, the footprints of small creatures that have slipped through the doorway without opening the door further). An Investigation check or an examination of the top of the door reveals the acid-filled bucket.

***Keeping Clear.*** Magic (such as the *mage hand* cantrip), a long pole, or a similar item can be used to trigger the trap from a distance, resulting in a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A Medium creature can make an Acrobatics check to slip through the partially open door. A Small creature automatically succeeds on the check.
* A Sleight of Hand check removes the bucket from the door.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The bucket spills its contents across the threshold. Each creature within 5 feet of the door when the bucket falls makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 5 (2d4) acid damage, plus an additional 5 (2d4) acid damage at the end of its next turn. A creature can use an action to wipe off the acid, preventing the damage on the second turn.

**Success.** The bucket spills acid into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the door.

**Critical Success.** The trap is not triggered, and the creature obtains the bucket of acid, which can be thrown up to 20 feet as an improvised ranged weapon. A target hit by the bucket takes 2d4 acid damage, plus an additional 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn.

Black Dragon Pool Trap

2nd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); **DC** 17/15

*The floor of this area is sunken like a tiled pool or bath and filled with three feet of cloudy water. Half submerged in the liquid are three stone cylinders sitting on their edges like wheels.*

What seems to be water is actually acid. A creature or object that enters the acid triggers a Failure.

***Pool.*** The pool’s liquid is cloudy, but not so much that it obscures the enameled tiles that line the bottom of the pool, which are painted with black dragon heads. A Perception check, or sniffing the air, reveals a sharp, acidic smell.

***Cylinders.*** The stone cylinders are four feet in diameter and one foot long. They can be rolled in straight lines back and forth across the pool. An Investigation check reveals a footprint on one of the cylinders.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Dexterity check to jump on a cylinder and roll it across the pool.
* If the adventurers gather suitable materials, they can make an Engineering check to build a bridge or arrange stepping stones across the pool.
* A creature can jump over the pool.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Metal objects, as well as organic objects such as wood, cloth, or rope, also take this damage.

Other inorganic materials, such as glass and stone, are unaffected.

A creature takes full damage from the trap only if partially or completely submerged in the acid. A creature that is merely touched or splashed by the acid instead takes 7 (2d6) acid damage or half damage on a success.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature avoids the pool.

**Black Dragon Pool Trap Variant: White Dragon Pool Trap**

This room is freezing. Instead of acid, the pool is filled with water covered with a sheet of ice. No stone wheels are present.

If the total weight on the ice exceeds 300 pounds (for instance, if two Medium creatures or one Large creature moves onto the ice), the ice breaks. A creature that falls in the icy water triggers a Failure.

The trap has the following features: ***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by transmutation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the ice requires a

spellcasting ability check and causes the ice to melt, disabling the trap.

***Pool.*** The ice is cloudy, but not so much that it obscures the enameled tiles that line the bottom of the pool, which are painted with white dragon heads. An Investigation, Nature, or Perception check, or testing the ice, reveals that it is weak and may collapse under heavy weight.

Cold damage dealt to the pool thickens the ice, allowing it to support an additional pound for each point of cold damage dealt. Fire damage weakens the ice by one pound per point of fire damage dealt.

The trap has the following conditions: **Critical Failure or Failure.** A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature avoids the pool.

Black Tentacles Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); **DC** 16/14

*A tapestry depicts a ship being pulled beneath the waves by the tentacles of some huge, aquatic beast.*

The tapestry conceals a door. Touching the door’s handle triggers a Failure.

***Exploration.*** A Perception or Investigation check, or moving the tapestry, reveals a locked door of black iron behind the tapestry. (At the Narrator’s discretion, the door may lead either to another area or an alcove containing a Boon or Discovery.)

Once the door is discovered, an Arcana, Investigation, or Perception check, or examining the door, reveals a small magical *glyph of warding* on the door’s handle.

Characters that make a Stealth check to hide may eventually see denizens of the dungeon pass through the door, speaking a password that disables the trap for 1 minute.

***Keeping Clear.*** Opening the door without touching the handle, such as with *mage*

*hand* or a similar effect, doesn’t trigger the trap.

***Spell Effect.*** This is an evocation effect created by a 4th-level spell. Casting *dispel magic* on the tapestry triggers a Critical Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Arcana or thieves' tools check to weaken the glyph.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The glyph casts *black tentacles* on a

20-foot square next to the door. The trap is then disabled.

**Success** The trap is temporarily weakened. For 1 round, each Success counts as a Critical Success.

**Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

Bookcase Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP); **DC** 15/14

*On one wall is a bookcase bearing a brass plaque that reads, “Give a book, take a book”. Against the opposite wall stands a statue of a wizard with hand outstretched towards the bookcase.*

The bookcase has 18 books on it. A Failure is triggered at the end of a creature’s turn if that creature possesses a book from the bookcase and the bookcase has less than 18 books on it. The trap isn’t triggered if the statue’s vision of the bookcase is blocked with a blindfold or similar item.

***Bookcase.*** Each of the books is a rare book worth 100 gp.

***Spell Effect.*** This is an evocation effect created by a 5th-level spell. Casting *dispel magic* on the statue disables the trap.

***Statue.*** An Investigation check or an examination of the statue reveals a glowing glyph on the statue’s outstretched palm. A

creature that makes an Arcana check recognizes the glyph as a *glyph of warding* that triggers an unknown spell under unknown conditions.

The statue is an object with AC 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A creature that damages the statue without destroying it outright triggers a Critical Failure.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a *S*leight of Hand check to take a book without the statue sensing it.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** A *magic missile* spell fires from the glyph on the statue's palm, targeting the triggering creature. It fires seven missiles for 1d4 + 1 force damage each. The trap resets after 24 hours. **Success or Critical Success.** The trap is not triggered.

Bright Mirror Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); **DC** 16/14

*In a dark room, a frame on the wall contains a mirror. When dim light falls on the metal, it begins to glow.*

When bright light falls on the mirror, a Failure is triggered.

***Exploration.*** While in dim light, the mirror’s glow correlates to the amount of light that falls upon it. A creature that makes an Arcana or History check recalls that dangerous energy imbalances are sometimes associated with such glowing mirrors.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the mirror requires a spellcasting ability check and triggers a Success.

***Mirror.*** Turning the mirror towards the wall or covering it with an opaque object such as a cloth prevents light from falling on it. The

mirror is a 600-pound object with AC 10 and 1 hit point. Breaking it triggers a Critical Failure. Using a second mirror to reflect the metal’s light back at it also destroys the mirror without triggering a Critical Failure.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength check to remove the mirror from the wall and set it down without breaking it.

**Critical Failure.** As Failure, but it creates a 60-foot sphere of burning light centered on the mirror.

**Failure.** A 30-foot cone of burning light shines from the metal. Each creature in the area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) radiant damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. The trap is then disabled for 24 hours.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is permanently disabled.

Brown Mold Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); **DC** 16/14

*In a frigid room, a frost-covered glass bottle rests on a table.*

The bottle is filled with **brown mold**.

The area 30 feet around the bottle is unnaturally cold. When a source of heat, such as a warm-blooded creature, comes within 5 feet of the brown mold, a Failure is triggered. If a flame comes within 5 feet of the brown mold, a Critical Failure is triggered.

A Boon or Discovery may be at the bottom of the bottle.

***Exploration.*** Examining the bottle from a distance reveals that it is filled with a brown, furry mold. A creature that makes an Arcana or Nature check recognizes the brown mold

and knows that it grows rapidly in heat and is vulnerable to cold.

***Keeping Clear.*** The bottle can be broken or moved from a distance with magic or a long object, or simply avoided.

***Spell Solve.*** Cold damage destroys the brown mold.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Acrobatics check to move through the area quickly enough to avoid negative consequences.

**Critical Failure.** As a Failure, and the bottle breaks. The mold expands over surfaces to surround the heat source in a 10-foot radius.

**Failure.** The triggering target is subject to the effects of brown mold. **Success or Critical Success.** The brown mold isn’t disturbed.

Caltrops Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*The black-tiled floor is speckled with silvery glints in the dim light.*

Metal caltrops cover a stretch of floor. The first time a creature moves in the area, it triggers a Failure.

***Exploration.*** A Perception check or an examination of the source of the silvery glints reveals the nature of the trap. A creature that attempts an Investigation check automatically discovers the caltrops. The caltrops can be spotted easily in bright light.

***Navigating the Caltrops.*** A creature aware of the trap can avoid its effects by moving carefully at half speed, spending 10 feet of movement for each 5 feet moved. A creature can use an action to collect or sweep the tiny metal objects from a

5-foot-square space.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Acrobatics check to move at full speed through the area.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The triggering creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and its walking speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its turn. Thereafter, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet until it regains at least 1 hit point.

**Success or Critical Success.** The triggering creature avoids the trap.

**Caltrops Trap Variant: Slippery Floor**

The floor is covered with steel ball bearings, greased with glistening lard, or sparkles with ice. Any reference to caltrops refers instead to ball bearings, grease, or ice. Replace the Failure or Critical Failure condition with the following:

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The triggering creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone.

Chaos Crystals

*4th tier (elite supernatural trap)*

**Challenge** 18 (40,000 XP); **DC** 22/17

*A cyclone of flame and frost engulfs the area.*

A pair of crystals suffused with elemental energy orbit one another in the center of the area. Surrounding them is a 60-foot-radius, opaque, spherical cyclone of fire and ice. The cyclone spreads around corners but may be contained by at least 1 foot of stone. The area inside the cyclone is difficult terrain. A creature triggers a Critical Failure when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn inside the area. Nonmagical objects that are not worn

or carried are destroyed when they enter the cyclone.

***Exploration.*** A creature that makes an Arcana or Nature check recognizes that the energy is magical or elemental in nature. An Investigation check reveals that the energy emanates from a central point.

***Eye of the Cyclone.*** A creature that reaches the center of the cyclone discovers a 5-foot-diameter area of safety. In the middle of this area, two elemental crystals are locked together in a close orbit. A creature that makes an Arcana check determines that mental power might be able to control the crystals.

A creature that touches one of the crystals, or starts its turn holding a crystal, triggers a Failure. Together, the crystals are treated as a single object with AC 20, 60 hit points, and immunity to all damage except bludgeoning, slashing, and force damage. Destroying the crystals triggers a Success; each attack against the crystals that doesn’t destroy them outright triggers a Failure.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the crystals while within the eye requires a spellcasting ability check and triggers a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength or thieves' tools check to remove a crystal from its orbit.
* A creature within 5 feet of the crystals can make an Intelligence check to mentally separate the crystals.

**Critical Failure.** The creature makes a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 27 (5d10) fire damage and 27 (5d10) cold damage, is pushed 30 feet away from the center of the cyclone, and is knocked prone. On a success, it

takes half damage and is not pushed or knocked prone.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, but the creature takes either the fire or cold damage, not both.

**Success.** The crystals’ connection is weakened. Another Success counts as a Critical Success.

**Critical Success.** The crystals are separated, and the trap is disabled. While the crystals are small, they are difficult to move: as an action, a creature can make a Strength to move a crystal physically or an Intelligence check to move a crystal using mental power. If the crystals are reunited, the trap resets.

Collapsing Dungeon

*2nd tier (elite constructed trap)* **Challenge** 7 (5,800 XP); **DC** 16/14 *Cracks criss-cross the ceiling. With each motion and loud noise, tremors shake the floor.*

When a creature disturbs or destroys a focal point central to the dungeon (such as a pillar, a sacred object, or a magic rune), the dungeon begins to collapse. Once the collapse begins, it can’t be undone. Creatures in the dungeon must escape before the dungeon is completely destroyed.

***Exploration.*** An Engineering check or an examination of the dungeon’s focal point reveals that the dungeon’s structure is unstable, and that it could be shored up with support beams. An examination of the ceiling or floor reveals cracks along the ceiling, as well as dust and dirt that sifts down to the floor. When a creature touches the dungeon’s focal point, creatures within 30 feet of it feel a faint tremor.

***Collapse.*** Roll initiative. On initiative count 20, a 40 by 40-foot unstable area appears centered on the focal point. Each successive turn on initiative count 20, the size of the unstable area increases by 20 feet in all directions.

A creature that starts its turn inside the unstable area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure or success, the creature triggers this challenge’s Failure or Success effect. A roll of 1 triggers a Critical Failure.

Once the unstable area completely encompasses the dungeon, the dungeon’s ceiling collapses, burying all creatures and objects in rubble. Each creature in the dungeon suffers a Critical Failure, and the effect ends. If the dungeon is composed of multiple levels, a collapse occurs once the unstable area encompasses a level but affects only that level until the unstable area spreads further.

Once the collapse begins, a Large object (such as a statue or a *wall of stone*) propped against the ceiling in the unstable area prevents the area from growing for 1 round.

***Shoring Up.*** Before the collapse, a creature can spend a minute and make an Engineering check to shore up the dungeon’s structure. If the dungeon’s structural integrity relies on magical energy, an Arcana or Religion check may be made instead. If the dungeon is shored up, there is a 50 percent chance it does not collapse when the focal point is disturbed.

Once the collapse begins, a creature can make a Strength check to hold up the ceiling or an Engineering check to prop it up. Doing so temporarily halts the collapse, preventing the unstable area from growing for 1 round. A creature must be in the unstable area to prop up the ceiling.

**Critical Failure.** The creature is knocked prone and becomes

trapped under the falling rubble, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. While trapped, the creature can’t breathe and doesn’t need to make Dexterity saving throws against this challenge. As an action, a creature can make a Strength check to free a trapped creature.

Once freed, a creature’s escape route might be blocked by fallen rubble, at the Narrator’s discretion. **Failure.** The triggering creature is struck by the falling rubble, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature avoids the falling rubble.

**Collapsing Dungeon Variant: Deeper Dungeons**

The collapse of deep and ancient dungeons can be particularly catastrophic.

**Deep Collapsing Dungeon:** The deep collapsing dungeon is CR 10 (11,800 XP) and has a DC of 18/15. On a Failure or Critical Failure, a creature takes an additional 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. **Deeper Collapsing Dungeon:** The deeper collapsing dungeon is CR 13 (20,000 XP) and has a DC of 19/16. On a Failure or Critical Failure, a creature takes an additional 31 (9d6) bludgeoning damage.

On each turn, the unstable area increases by 30 feet instead of 20 feet.

**Deepest Collapsing Dungeon:** The deepest collapsing dungeon is CR 17 (36,000 XP) and has a DC of 21/17. On a Failure or Critical Failure, a creature takes an additional 52 (15d6) bludgeoning damage. On each turn, the unstable area increases by 40 feet instead of 20 feet.

Commanding Voice

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*A bas relief of an angry deity glowers from the wall.*

Approaching within 10 feet of the bas relief without displaying the god’s holy symbol triggers a Critical Failure.

***Exploration.*** A creature that makes a Religion check identifies the name and holy symbol of the depicted god. A Perception check or an examination of the bas relief reveals a tiny magic glyph near the god’s mouth. A creature that makes an up-close Investigation check automatically finds the glyph but may trigger the trap.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by enchantment magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the bas relief requires a spellcasting ability check and triggers a Critical Success.

***Mark of Favor.*** A creature wearing or holding the appropriate holy symbol as it approaches the bas relief triggers a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves’ tools check to scrape away the glyph, or make an attack roll with a bludgeoning weapon against AC 15 to destroy the bas relief.

**Critical Failure.** The bas relief casts *command* (DC 13) on each creature within 60 feet, ordering them to "Flee!" The booming voice can be heard up to 300 feet away.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, except only the triggering creature is affected.

**Success.** The trap is disabled but resets after 1 minute.

**Critical Success.** The trap is permanently disabled.

**Commanding Voice Variant: Holy Writ**

A passage from the god's sacred text is etched beneath the bas relief. For example: "All who are wounded shall serve." A creature that makes a Religion check knows the appropriate ritual response, such as "All who serve shall be healed." A creature that speaks the ritual response aloud as it approaches the bas relief triggers a Success.

Contagion Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP); **DC** 17/15 *The lid of the sarcophagus is carved to resemble a recumbent skeleton.*

The mummified remains inside the sarcophagus are cursed. Touching the cursed remains, either directly or with an object, triggers a Failure.

***Sarcophagus.*** Smaller carvings on the sarcophagus depict animated skeletons going about daily life: worshiping in temples, tilling fields, or marching to war. Inside the sarcophagus, an inanimate mummy grips a rune-covered scroll. A creature that makes a History or Religion check identifies the runes as the names of ancient plagues.

***Scroll.*** The scroll is a *spell scroll* of *contagion* or some other Boon or Discovery. ***Spell Effect.*** This is a necromancy effect created by a 5th-level spell. Casting *remove curse* or a successful *dispel magic* on the mummy triggers a Critical Success.

***Spell Solve.*** The mummy’s grip on the scroll is too tight to release with *mage hand*, but it’s possible to do so with *telekinesis*.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Sleight of Hand check to remove the scroll without touching the mummy.
* A creature can smash the remains with an attack with a bludgeoning weapon.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The triggering creature is targeted by a *contagion* spell (flesh rot).

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Contagion Trap Variants: Other Contagion Traps**

Instead of a sarcophagus and mummy, the room contains:

* A wine rack holding two bottles of wine. One bottle's label identifies it as "Talasay '47." The other is "Mindfire '47." The Mindfire bottle is cursed. A creature that makes a History check identifies the Talasay as a rare vintage worth 250 gp. A creature that makes a Medicine check recognizes “mindfire” as the name of a disease. A creature that makes an Investigation check notices that the inner surface of the Mindfire label has a spell written on it. A creature that uncorks and wafts either bottle can make a History check to identify its contents. Both bottles contain Talasay wine, but the contents of the Mindfire bottle are cursed. A creature that drinks the Mindfire wine is targeted by a *contagion* spell (mindfire).
* A fingerbone floating inside a vial filled with murky liquid. The vial is labeled "Fingerbone of Gaz'Ak the Blind." A creature that makes a History check recalls that Gaz'Ak was an evil prophet of times past. The first creature to touch the fingerbone is targeted by a *contagion* spell (blinding sickness).

Crossbow Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*A ragged painting of an epic battle hangs on the wall.*

Hidden behind the painting is an alcove containing a heavy crossbow (and a 50 percent chance of a Boon or Discovery). A floor-level tripwire stretches from the wall below the painting to the opposite wall. A creature that walks across the floor trips the wire, triggering a Critical Failure.

***Exploration.*** A distant examination of the painting reveals that it is riddled with punctures. A creature that makes an

up-close Investigation check automatically discovers the alcove behind the painting but may trigger the trap. A Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals a taut wire strung across the floor.

***Tripwire.*** Sweeping the floor with a pole or other object triggers the trap harmlessly. A creature aware of the tripwire may simply step over it.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature aware of the tripwire can make a thieves’ tools check to disarm it.

**Critical Failure.** The crossbow makes a ranged attack with advantage against the triggering creature, attacking with a +4 bonus and dealing 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit. Once fired, the crossbow can’t fire again until the trap is reset.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, but the attack is not made with advantage. **Success or Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Crossbow Trap Variant: Ballista Trap**

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); **DC** 16/14

A curtain (instead of a painting) conceals a Large ballista. The trap has the following alternate Critical Failure effect:

**Critical Failure.** The ballista makes a ranged attack with advantage against each creature in a 5-foot-wide line, attacking with a +7 bonus and dealing 27 (5d10) piercing damage on a hit. Once fired, the ballista can’t fire again until the trap is reset.

**Crossbow Trap Variant: Cannon Trap**

*4th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 19 (22,000 XP); **DC** 22/17

A paper screen depicting a nautical scene (instead of a painting) conceals a Large cannon. The trap has the following alternate Failure or Critical Failure effect:

**Failure or Critical Failure.** The cannon fires shrapnel in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage and 22 (4d10) slashing damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

Objects take this damage as well. Once fired, the cannon can’t fire again until the trap is reset.

**Crossbow Trap Variant: Poison Crossbow Trap**

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

A creature hit by the crossbow also takes 5 (1d10) poison damage.

Crushing Pit Trap

*2nd tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 6 (4,600 XP); **DC** 16/14

*One of the exits from this room is a metal door bearing a sign that reads “Invited Guests Only.”*

***Door.*** A character that makes an Engineering or Investigation check discovers that the door’s insides contain complex machinery.

The door is locked. Opening the door without using the proper key causes the room’s floor to collapse. A creature can

make a thieves' tools check to pick the door’s lock. On a failure, the door remains locked and the floor collapses. On a success, the door unlocks but the floor still collapses. On a critical success, the door unlocks and the floor doesn’t collapse.

Opening the door in any other manner (except for using the proper key) causes the floor to collapse.

***Floor.*** A successful Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals unobtrusive seams and hinges, as if the entire room is the lid of a pit trap.

When the floor collapses, all creatures in the room plummet into a 30-foot-deep pit, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall. Two opposite walls inside the pit then begin

moving inward. Roll initiative. Each round on initiative count 10, the pit narrows by 5 feet. When it reaches 0 feet, each creature inside the pit takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. The trap is then disabled. After 1 hour, the walls of the pit retract to their starting position and the floor snaps back into place.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature that can reach both walls of the pit (most creatures have a reach approximately equal to their height) can make a Strength check to keep the walls apart.
* A creature using an object wide enough to reach both walls makes its Strength check to prop open the walls with advantage. On a Critical Failure, a nonmagical object is destroyed, and a magical object is damaged. A magical object damaged a second time is destroyed.
* A creature can make an Engineering check to determine how best to slow the walls. Success or failure on this

check doesn’t result in a trap Success or Failure. A success on this check grants advantage to the next ability check made against the trap within the next minute.

* With a Strength check, a creature can jam spikes under the walls of the pit, triggering a Success.
* The pit’s walls are smooth and slippery. A creature climbing them must make an Athletics or Acrobatics check, making no progress on a failure. Success or failure on this check doesn’t result in a trap Success or Failure.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The walls continue closing.

**Success.** The walls stop moving until the end of the triggering creature’s next turn.

**Critical Success.** The pit’s walls move 5 feet apart. Moving the walls back to their starting positions disables the trap.

**Crushing Pit Trap Variant: Statue Pit Trap** Against one wall stands a statue of an armored ape giving the thumbs up.

Instead of a door, the trap has the following feature:

***Statue.*** An Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the statue, reveals that the statue is bolted to the wall and that the ape’s hand can be rotated at the wrist. Spinning the ape’s hand so that its thumb points down causes the room’s floor to collapse. A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable the mechanism inside the statue. On a failure, the floor collapses. On a success, the floor doesn’t collapse.

Crushing Room Trap

*2nd tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 10 (11,800 XP); **DC** 18/15

*Beyond a metal door lies a 15 by 15-foot room, its walls and floor covered in brownish stains. On the far side of the room is a 2-foot-tall alcove.*

The metal door automatically snaps shut and locks 30 seconds after it is opened. When the door closes, two opposite walls begin moving inward. Roll initiative. Each round on initiative count 10, the room narrows by 3 feet. When the room reaches a width of less than 5 feet, Medium creatures must squeeze. When it reaches 0 feet, each creature inside the room takes 49 (14d6) bludgeoning damage. The walls then retract to their starting position, the door unlocks, and the trap resets.

***Alcove.*** The alcove is wide enough to fit a single Small creature or a Medium creature that makes a DC 15 Dexterity check. A creature inside the alcove avoids the crushing walls.The alcove contains a treasure hoard or a Boon or Discovery.

***Door.*** The iron door is an object with AC 17, 100 hit points, and immunity to piercing, slashing, lightning, poison, and psychic damage. Forcing open the door requires three Strength checks. The door has no lock, but it has two hinges. Each hinge can be removed with a thieves’ tools check. The door falls off when both hinges are removed.

***Exploration.*** A Perception check or an examination of the door before it closes reveals that the door is on a spring and closes by itself. An Engineering check or an examination of the lock or handles reveals that it has an automatic locking mechanism that prevents it from being opened from the inside. An Investigation check or an examination of the floor or walls reveals that the brownish stains are dried blood, and that the floor and walls aren’t mortared together; rather, the walls seem to rest on the floor.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature that can reach both walls (most creatures have a reach approximately equal to their height) can make a Strength check to keep the walls apart.
* A creature using an object wide enough to reach both walls can make a Strength check with advantage to prop open the walls. On a Critical Failure, a nonmagical object is destroyed, and a magical object is damaged. A magical object damaged a second time is destroyed.
* A creature can make an Engineering check to determine how best to slow the walls. Success or failure on this check doesn’t result in a trap Success or Failure. A success on this check grants advantage to the next ability check made against the trap within the next minute.
* With a Strength check, a creature can jam spikes under the walls, triggering a Success.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The walls continue closing.

**Success.** The walls stop moving until the end of the triggering creature’s next turn.

**Critical Success.** The walls move 3 feet apart. Moving the walls so that they are 15 feet apart disables the trap.

Cursed Altar

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

*A black stone altar is carved with the symbol of a death god. Atop the altar are 14 tarnished silver coins and a golden chalice.*

Removing an item from the altar, or knocking an object off with a weapon, pole, or similar item, triggers a Critical Failure.

***Exploration.*** A Religion check reveals that many altars are enchanted to punish interlopers. An Investigation check, or an examination of the coins, reveals that the coins are also stamped with the god’s symbol. The golden chalice is worth 100 gp. ***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by necromancy magic. Casting *remove curse* or a successful *dispel magic* on the altar triggers a Critical Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* With a Religion check, a creature can perform a 10-minute ritual to purify the altar, with a success triggering a Critical Success.
* A creature can make a ranged attack to knock the coins or the chalice off the altar. The chalice has AC 10, but the coins have AC 14. **Critical Failure.** The trap is triggered. If the triggering creature is a humanoid, it gains 10 (3d6) temporary hit points, and the humanoid creature nearest to them within 500 feet takes the same amount of necrotic damage. This damage can't be avoided or reduced in any way. The altar’s magic then ends.

**Failure.** The altar and the items on it dissolve into smoke, and the magical effect ends.

**Success.** An item is knocked off the altar, and the trap isn’t triggered. The magical effect ends once all the items are knocked off the altar.

**Critical Success.** A successful ritual ends the magical effect, allowing items on the altar to be removed safely. A Critical Success with a

ranged attack knocks 1d4 + 1 items off the altar.

**Cursed Altar Variant: Altar to Knowledge** The altar is carved with the holy symbol of a god of knowledge or magic. It radiates transmutation magic instead of necromancy. **Critical Failure:** A humanoid creature that triggers the trap must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or gain an extra ear on their forehead. A creature with this extra ear treats every suggestion, piece of advice, or command directed at them as a *suggestion* spell (DC 12). The effect ends after 1 hour, until the effect is ended by a *dispel magic*, *remove curse*, or *lesser restoration* spell, or until the creature makes three successful saving throws against the suggestions. The extra ear disappears when the effect ends.

**Cursed Altar Variant: Altar to Nature** The altar is made of wood and carved with thorns and flowers that glow with an eerie violet light. It radiates evocation magic instead of necromancy.

**Critical Failure:** A humanoid creature that triggers the trap must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or begin to glow, as if affected by the *faerie fire* spell. The effect lasts 1 hour or until a *dispel magic* or *remove curse* spell ends the effect.

**Cursed Altar Variant: Altar to the Sun** The altar is made of white stone and carved with a stylized sun. It radiates evocation magic instead of necromancy.

**Critical Failure:** A humanoid creature that triggers the trap is struck blind. This blindness lasts until all items are returned to the altar or until a *lesser restoration* spell ends the effect.

Darkness Statue

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*An ebony statue of a trickster god has a black gem set in its forehead. The statue has one hand behind its back and one hand on its lips.*

Touching the gem triggers a Failure. ***Gem.*** A Perception or Investigation check, or an examination of the gem, reveals that the gem is worthless black glass. Smashing the gem results in a Critical Failure.

Covering the gem blocks the *darkness*

effect.

***In the Darkness.*** Each time the trap is triggered, the statue animates for one round and makes a Sleight of Hand check (+5 bonus), attempting to pickpocket a creature within 5 feet of it. This check is made with advantage if the creature is unable to see. The statue then adopts its original position, piling any stolen items behind it, and becomes inanimate. Searching the area or looking behind the statue reveals any pilfered items.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the gem triggers a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to remove the gem, or an Arcana check to dampen the gem’s magic for one round and allow it to be removed safely.

**Critical Failure.** The glass gem shatters in its socket, releasing a *darkness* spell centered on the statue. The *darkness* is permanent until dispelled. See In the Darkness. **Failure.** The gem casts *darkness* with a duration of 1 minute. The trap automatically resets after 1 minute. See In the Darkness.

**Success.** The gem can be removed safely, disabling the trap.

**Critical Success.** As a Success, except the gem retains some of its magic. It becomes an *arcane gem* containing *darkness.*

**Darkness Statue Variant: The Cyclops Eye**

Instead of a statue, the black gem is set in the eye of a cyclops carved in bas relief on the wall. The In the Darkness feature is replaced with the following:

***In the Darkness.*** Each time the trap is triggered, a grinding sound is heard as a slab of stone within the area of darkness noisily retracts, exposing an alcove containing an item from the Boons and Discoveries table. The alcove stays open for 1 round, and then the slab noisily grinds shut again. While closed, the stone slab can be discovered with a DC 20 Investigation check and can be opened with a DC 18 Strength check. The slab is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

Drop Ceiling Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); **DC** 15/14

*Several inanimate skeletons lie on the floor, their helmets dented and their skulls crushed. A warhammer with a golden head hangs from the wall on a pair of hooks.*

A Failure is triggered if the hooks on the wall ever support less than 10 pounds of weight—for instance, if the hammer is lifted from the hooks.

***Ceiling.*** A successful Investigation or Perception check, or an examination of the ceiling, reveals that the ceiling isn't mortared to the wall and probably slides up and down. The ceiling can be propped up with something tall and sturdy.

***Hooks.*** The hooks are 3 feet up the wall. A successful Engineering check, or an examination of the hooks, reveals that they attach to some sort of mechanism inside the wall. Holding or weighing down the hooks while the hammer is removed triggers a Success.

***Skeletons.*** A Medicine check reveals that the skeletons were killed by blunt force to the head.

***Warhammer.*** The warhammer on the hooks has a 10-pound head made of solid gold.

It’s worth 500 gp.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable the hooks.
* A creature can make an Engineering check to wedge spikes or similar objects into the gaps between the walls and ceiling.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The ceiling plummets, stopping 4 feet above the floor. Creatures whose heads are at least 4 feet above the floor when the ceiling drops must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. After 1 minute, the ceiling grinds back to its original position.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

Explosive Runes Trap

2nd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); **DC** 16/14

*A cozy study contains shelves lined with books and an iron desk. Resting on the desk is a metal-bound book.*

Opening the spellbook without speaking the passphrase “Hungry Flame” triggers a Failure.

***Book.*** The metal-bound book is a spellbook containing *burning hands*,

*scorching ray*, and *glyph of warding*. The book’s cover is emblazoned with a stylized golden sun. The words “Hungry Flame” are written on the book’s spine. The book’s pages are metal and are immune to fire damage.A creature that makes an Arcana or History check knows that many mages use passwords and other tricks to protect their spellbooks against thieves.

***Glyph.*** An Arcana, Investigation, or Perception check reveals that the sun symbol is a *glyph of warding.*

***Spell Effect.*** This is an evocation effect created by a 3rd-level spell. Casting *dispel magic* on the sun symbol triggers a Critical Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Arcana or thieves' tools check to disable the glyph.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The glyph explodes as the explosive runes version of a *glyph of warding*. Each creature within 20 feet of the glyph must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

**Success.** The glyph is damaged. A second Success triggers a Critical Success.

**Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Explosive Runes Trap Variant: City of Brass Trap**

Instead of a spellbook, the explosive runes are inscribed on a brass door etched with pictures of efreet strolling the streets of a vast metropolis. A creature that makes an Arcana or History check identifies the city as the City of Brass. Opening the door without speaking the passphrase “City of Brass” triggers a Failure.

Falling Axe Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

*A scarred wooden chest is flanked by two axe-wielding suits of armor.*

If the wooden chest changes weight by more than 5 pounds or is moved, or if a suit of armor is jostled or moved, a Critical Failure is triggered.

***Exploration.*** An Engineering check or an examination of the suits of armor reveals that the armor is inanimate but contains mechanisms of some kind. A Perception or Investigation check, or an examination of the floor, reveals that the chest rests on a counterweight pressure plate.

Opening the chest doesn’t trigger the trap. The chest contains minor treasure weighing at least 5 pounds (such as a

10-pound gold statuette worth 500 gp or an appropriate item from the Boons and Discoveries table).

***Suits of Armor.*** Each suit of armor is an object with AC 18, 20 hit points, and immunity to lightning, poison, and psychic damage. Attacking a suit of armor and failing to destroy it triggers a Failure.

Destroying a suit of armor prevents it from making further attacks, turning any Critical Failure into a Failure. If both suits are destroyed, the trap is disabled.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable a suit of armor’s mechanism (preventing that armor from attacking) or the pressure plate under the chest (allowing the treasure to be taken safely).
* A creature can make a Sleight of Hand check to replace the treasure inside the chest with other items of equal weight, so that the pressure plate isn’t triggered.

**Critical Failure.** Both suits of armor swing their axes. Each suit of armor makes a melee attack with a +5 bonus against a creature within 5 feet of a suit of armor or the chest, dealing 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a hit. After a hit or miss, the trap resets and can be triggered again. **Failure.** As Critical Failure, but only one suit of armor swings its axe.

**Success.** The trap isn’t triggered. **Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Falling Axe Trap Variant: The Doormen**

In the Doormen trap, the suits of armor flank a scarred wooden door instead of a chest.

Any reference to the chest is ignored. The trap is triggered if a character steps or puts weight on the 5 by 5-foot pressure plate hidden directly in front of the doorway.

Opening the door does not trigger the trap. While the door is open, the pressure plate can be jumped over.

The trap has the following alternate Exploration feature:

***Exploration.*** A Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals the pressure plate in front of the door. An Investigation check or an examination of the door reveals that the scars on the door were caused by axe blades.

Falling Room Trap

1st tier (elite constructed trap)

**Challenge** 3 (1,400 XP); **DC** 14/14

*This 10-foot-square room has metal walls, ceiling, and floors. The only exit is a hatch in the ceiling. A wooden board lies on the floor.* The room is a malfunctioning elevator.

When the room’s door closes while the room contains more than 50 pounds of weight, the room plunges 30 feet down its elevator shaft before coming to a sudden

halt. Each creature in the elevator takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

The room’s door now leads to a lower dungeon level or (if no lower level exists) a small room containing a treasure hoard or a Boon or Discovery. Opening the ceiling hatch allows a creature to climb the elevator shaft and return to the original floor.

While the room occupies the lower level, re-closing the door while the room contains at least 50 pounds of weight causes the elevator to rocket 30 feet back to its original position. Upon arrival, each creature in the elevator is catapulted against the ceiling, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Board.*** The wooden board is a sign reading “Out of Order,” lying upside down.

***Door.*** The door opens inward into the elevator room. An Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the door, reveals that the door connects to a mechanism that triggers when the door closes.

***Room.*** A Perception check, or jumping up and down inside the room, reveals that the room trembles when creatures move about inside, as if it weren’t fixed in place.

***Hatch.*** The hatch on the ceiling is metal. It’s locked, and also warped and damaged as if it had been struck.

**Possible Solutions**

* Opening the hatch requires both a thieves' tools check to pick the lock and a Strength check to force it open.
* Two successful melee attacks against AC 17 open the hatch.
* A creature that makes a Strength check to pry back the room’s wall reveals gears and other machinery. A creature can make an Engineering check to repair the exposed machinery, allowing the elevator

room to move between floors safely. A *mending* spell automatically repairs the exposed machinery.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The attempt has no effect.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature succeeds in its goal.

**Falling Room Trap Variant: Plummeting Room Trap**

*2nd tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 14 (23,000 XP); **DC** 20/16

The elevator’s shaft is 120 feet deep. Each time the elevator would descend, it descends only 30 feet, dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall as normal. The elevator also descends 30 feet each time a creature triggers a Failure.

Once the room has descended four times, it reaches the bottom of the shaft. Further Failures (or closing the door again) cause the room to rise 30 feet, dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage each time, until it returns to its starting position—at which point its direction reverses and the process repeats.

At the Narrator’s discretion, opening the door at each of the elevator’s stops might reveal another level of the dungeon or nothing but the bare wall of the elevator shaft. In either case, the very bottom of the shaft leads either to another dungeon level or a small room containing treasure.

False Door Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); **DC** 14/14

*Behind a cracked floor is a 10-foot-square stone door with handles on both the right and left sides.*

Turning one of the door’s handles alone does nothing. Turning both handles at the same time triggers a Failure.

***Exploration.*** An Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the door, reveals that the door’s hinges are set into the floor horizontally instead of vertically along the sides. A Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals that there are two cracks in the floor, each about 3 feet in front of a door handle. (The door handles are 3 feet above floor level.) **Possible Solutions**

* A creature that braces the door or holds it up while the handles are turned can make a Strength check to prevent it from crashing down. **Critical Failure or Failure.** The door bangs down like a drawbridge. Each creature in the 10-foot-square area directly in front of the door makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage from the falling door. On a success, the creature can move out of the way. A solid wall is revealed behind the false door, possibly with a clue written on the wall.

**Success or Critical Success.** As a Failure, but the door opens harmlessly.

False Hoard Trap

0th tier (elite constructed trap)

**Challenge** 1 (400 XP); **DC** 13/13

*In a corner of the room, a seemingly inanimate dragon skeleton rests atop a mound of glittering treasure.*

The dragon skeleton is held together with fine wire. A wire attached to the dragon’s tail leads into a hole in the wall. If the wire, skeleton, or treasure is disturbed (by gathering the treasure, for instance), stone slabs descend from the ceiling to block the room’s exits. A creature directly beneath a slab must decide whether to

move into or out of the room. Poison gas hisses from a nozzle hidden under the treasure pile. Roll initiative. Each round on initiative count 10, each creature in the room must make a Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage. The nozzle continues producing gas for 1 minute, at which point the gas stops and the trap resets.

***Hoard.*** An Investigation check or an examination of the treasure reveals that it consists of worthless costume jewelry, polished tin cutlery, and thousands of copper pieces painted to look like electrum and gold coins. What appears at first to be worth thousands of gold pieces is worth perhaps a hundred.

***Skeleton.*** An Arcana or Nature check, or an examination of the skeleton, reveals that it is a wooden carving, painted white to resemble bones and held together by fine wires. A further examination of the wires reveals that one runs from the dragon’s tail to a hole in the wall.

***Wire.*** Before the trap is triggered, a creature can make a thieves' tools check to fix in place the wire on the dragon’s tail. A successful check triggers a Critical Success. On a failure, the trap is triggered. **Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength check to lift a stone slab. The slab must be propped open or it falls again. Succeeding on this check does not grant a Success on the trap, but it may allow creatures to escape the room.
* A creature that locates the source of the gas can make a Strength check to push the treasure aside, followed by a Dexterity check to plug the nozzle with a wad of cloth or a similar object.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The creature makes no progress in disarming the trap.

**Success.** The nozzle stops producing poison gas for 1 round. **Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

False Trapdoor Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); **DC** 15/14

*The room contains several wooden crates in various states of disrepair. Set into the high ceiling is a metal trapdoor secured with a heavy sliding bolt.*

Pulling back the sliding bolt requires a Strength check. Unbolting the trapdoor while underneath it triggers a Failure.

Unbolting the trapdoor while not underneath it triggers a Success.

***Ceiling.*** The ceiling is 20 feet high, so reaching the trapdoor might be difficult. ***Crates.*** There are six crates in total, each 4 feet on a side. Three of the crates have been smashed. An Investigation check reveals boot prints on one of the smashed crates. A creature that makes an Engineering check can deduce that the crates were probably smashed by a heavy weight dropped from above. (Previous explorers stacked three of the crates in order to reach the trapdoor and inadvertently triggered the trap.)

***Floor.*** An Investigation or Perception check, or an examination of the floor, reveals that the tiles beneath the trapdoor are cracked. ***Trapdoor.*** Opening the trapdoor reveals an alcove containing a heavy stone block. A Boon or Discovery is also hidden in the alcove.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature aware of potential danger when opening the trapdoor can make a Strength check to ease the

trapdoor open, or an Engineering check to use a quarterstaff or similar object as a brace.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The trapdoor swings open, causing the stone block to fall. A creature beneath the trapdoor must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. A rope connects the block to the ceiling. After 1 minute, the rope retracts, drawing the block back into the alcove, and the trap resets.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is triggered but the stone block doesn’t strike the triggering character.

Flammable Gas Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)* **Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP); **DC** 15/14 *Sitting beside each door is a barrel*

*half-filled with water, in which float the stubs of several torches and a few candles. A dark crack stretches across the floor down the center of the room.*

Entering the area while carrying an open flame, or magically creating fire inside the area, triggers a Failure. Only the areas within 5 feet of an entrance are safe from this effect. Open flames within these areas flicker and turn blue.

***Exploration.*** A Perception check or sniffing the air reveals the faint smell of rotten eggs. An Investigation check or an examination of the floor or ceiling reveals that the crack in the floor is caked with soot. A creature that makes an Engineering check knows that enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces can have problems with gas buildups.

***Floor Crack.*** Examining the crack in the floor reveals that it leads to a pitch-black hole a few inches in diameter. Closer

examination reveals that the smell of rotten eggs is stronger around the hole, which descends hundreds of feet to a natural cavity filled with dangerous, flammable gas. **Spell Solve.** A *gust of wind* or a similar effect dissipates the gas for 10 minutes.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength, Dexterity, or Engineering check to clog the hole with a wad of cloth or similar item. Failure on this check doesn’t result in a Failure but doesn’t deactivate the trap.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** A burst of flame fills the area. Everyone in the room, except for those within 5 feet of the room’s entrances, makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success. The explosion extinguishes any open flames and consumes the accumulated gas, making the trap inactive for 10 minutes.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Floating Sphere of Annihilation** 4th tier (elite constructed trap) **Challenge** 20 (50,000 XP); **DC** 23/18 *The walls of this room are inscribed with*

*glowing runes. A 5-foot-diameter sphere of inky darkness hovers several feet above the floor.*

An unusually large *sphere of annihilation* is magically suspended in place. When intelligent creatures approach within 30 feet of the sphere, the runes on the walls activate the sphere. Roll initiative. On initiative counts 15 and 5, the sphere moves 30 feet in a straight line towards the closest creature within 300 feet of the sphere’s starting position, stopping once it enters that creature’s space. The sphere

destroys nonliving obstacles it passes through. If it moves into a creature’s space, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) force damage on a failure. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, its body and gear utterly obliterated. The sphere returns to its original position if there are no living creatures within 300 feet of its starting space.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by necromancy magic. Casting *dispel magic* on one of the runes requires a spellcasting ability check and triggers a Success.

***Runes.*** The walls, floor, and ceiling each bear one glowing rune. A creature that makes an Arcana check recognizes that the runes cause the sphere to move towards living creatures. There are six runes. If all six runes are destroyed, the sphere no longer moves on its own and can’t be moved in any way.

***Sphere.*** A creature that makes an Arcana check identifies the sphere as a large *sphere of annihilation* and can recall details about this magic item. The sphere acts like other *spheres of annihilation* with regard to the destruction of matter and the effects of coming into contact with a planar portal.

Unlike other, smaller spheres, its movement can’t be mentally controlled—only temporarily halted.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Arcana or thieves' tools check to destroy one of the six runes inscribed on the walls (see the Runes feature).
* A creature that makes an Arcana check to control the sphere can force the sphere to remain stationary until the start of the creature’s next turn.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The sphere moves an additional 30 feet the next time it moves.

**Success or Critical Success.** The attempt is successful.

Forbidden Tome

*4th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 16 (30,000 XP); **DC** 21/17

*A sinister-looking, iron-shod book sits closed atop an ancient stone pedestal. An iron chain with warding sigils carved into every link affixes the book to the pedestal. Everything in the room except this chain seems to writhe and pulse unnervingly.*

Opening the book or removing it from the pedestal triggers a Failure.

***Book.*** The book is a tome of forbidden lore so vile that merely opening it warps reality itself. A creature that makes an Arcana or Religion check realizes that the chain’s warding sigils once allowed the book to be opened safely, but their magic has failed. If the book is opened safely, a creature that spends at least 1 hour reading it gains advantage on the next Arcana or Religion check it makes in the next 24 hours. At the Narrator’s discretion, the book may also contain some critical piece of information unavailable from any other source. The book is an object with AC 14, 40 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Damaging the book without destroying it outright triggers a Critical Failure.

***Pedestal.*** The pedestal is formed from the stone of the floor itself and can’t be moved. Damaging or otherwise disturbing the pedestal triggers a Failure.

***Chain.*** The chain’s links are etched with warding sigils, but their magic is currently inert. The chain is an object with AC 18, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and

psychic damage. Breaking the chain triggers a Critical Failure.

***Spell Solve.*** A *magic circle* spell cast around the book contains its fell power and allows it to be opened safely for the spell’s duration.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Arcana or Religion check to reactivate the chain’s warding sigils.

**Critical Failure.** As a Failure, except a **murmuring worm** also appears and attacks the creature nearest the book.

**Failure.** Reality bends and twists. Until the book is closed or properly warded, non-aberration creatures within 30 feet of the book treat the area as difficult terrain. In addition, a creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn within the area takes 14 (3d8) psychic damage and 14 (3d8) force damage and must succeed on an Intelligence save or gain a level of strife. Finally, a Critical Failure triggers at midnight every night until the book is either closed or properly warded. Destroying the book also ends this effect.

**Success.** The chain’s warding sigils are reactivated, allowing the book to be opened safely.

**Critical Success.** As a Success, and the next creature to read the book gains a permanent expertise die to Arcana checks. Only one creature can receive this benefit, with all future Critical Successes treated as an ordinary Success.

Gas Vacuum Trap

*3rd tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 12 (16,800 XP); **DC** 19/16

*A chest rests on the floor of a spotlessly clean, high-ceilinged room. A faint shimmer of magical force blocks the doorway into the room.*

A Perception or Investigation check, or looking into the room, reveals a cloud of gas roiling near the room’s ceiling. A second magical force field separates the gas from the lower portion of the room. A creature that makes an Arcana check deduces that the magical field blocking the door and the one blocking the gas are two sides of a magical cube of force. The force cube can be destroyed with a successful *dispel magic* spell or by dealing it at least 50 force damage.

***Vacuum.*** The space inside the force cube is a vacuum. Destroying the cube causes the room to flood with air from outside the room and with poison gas from the cloud above the cube.

***Spell Effect.*** This is an evocation effect created by a 5th-level spell. Casting *dispel magic* on the force cube triggers a Critical Failure.

***Spell Solve.*** A creature that teleports into the cube is exposed to vacuum but not to the poison gas. Once the force cube is destroyed, a *gust of wind* or similar effect dissipates the gas.

**Possible Solutions**

* When the force cube is destroyed, each creature within 30 feet must make a Strength saving throw. A creature that braces itself against a solid surface before the cube is destroyed makes the saving throw with advantage.
* **Critical Failure or Failure.** The creature is pulled into the room, takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone—just in time for the gas cloud to settle over them.

A creature that enters the gas-filled area for the first time on a turn, or that starts its turn inside the area, takes 22 (5d8) poison damage.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature is not pulled into the room.

Geas Trap

2nd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP); **DC** 18/15

*A table has been set with a vase of flowers, an envelope sealed with wax, a shortsword, a scroll, and a string of prayer beads.*

Breaking the seal on the envelope triggers a Failure.

***Magic Items.*** The sword, scroll, and prayer beads radiate magic. Touching or moving any of the three items causes the other two to vanish instantly. The sword is a *+2 shortsword*; the scroll is a *spell scroll* of *geas*; and the beads are a *necklace of prayer beads*.

***Envelope.*** An Arcana or Investigation check, or an examination of the envelope, reveals a *glyph of warding* on the envelope’s wax seal. Inside the envelope is a note that reads: “In exchange for this gift, do not harm the lord of this place.”

***Spell Effect.*** This is an abjuration effect created by a 5th-level spell. Casting *dispel magic* cast on the envelope’s seal triggers a Success.

***Spell Solve.*** Breaking the envelope’s seal with *mage hand* or a similar effect triggers a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Dexterity check to open the envelope without breaking the seal. A creature proficient in the Sleight of Hand skill

or with forgery kits can add their proficiency bonus to the roll.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The *glyph of warding* activates, casting *geas* on the creature that broke the seal. The victim telepathically hears the command "Do not harm the lord of this place." When the victim meets a particular creature within this dungeon, they understand that this is the creature they are forbidden to harm. Dealing damage to that creature or targeting the creature with a spell that forces a saving throw is forbidden by the geas. The geas can’t be removed while any member of the party possesses one of the three magic items found beside the note.

**Success or Critical Success.** The *geas* spell is not cast, and the trap is disabled.

Ghost Trap

*1st tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 4 (2,200 XP); **DC** 15/14 *Although the air is still, the sound of howling wind fills the room. Atop a lectern rests a book, its pages whipping back and forth as if blown by gusts of wind.*

A creature that touches the book or begins its turn carrying the book triggers a Failure.

***Exploration.*** A creature that makes an Arcana or Religion check senses the presence of unquiet spirits. On a critical success, the creature realizes the book on the lectern is possessed by a **ghost**. The book is a rare tome titled *On Immortality* and is worth 250 gp. A *detect magic* spell cast on the book reveals an aura of necromancy, while a *detect evil and good* spell reveals the presence of undead.

***Possession.*** A Success is triggered if Turn Undead, *dispel evil and good*, or a similar effect is used to drive the ghost from its host, if the ghost chooses to leave its host, or if the host drops to 0 hit points.

If a possessed creature takes damage, it makes a Charisma saving throw. On a success, a Success is triggered.

If the book is destroyed or is the target of Turn Undead, *banishment*, *dispel evil and good*, or *dispel magic* while inhabited by the ghost, the ghost appears within 5 feet of it. If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, the ghost is destroyed. The book is an object with AC 11, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The triggering creature makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the ghost that inhabits the book possesses the creature, and the trap is disabled.

The possessed creature is unconscious. The ghost enters the creature’s body and takes control of it. The ghost can be targeted only by effects that turn undead, and it retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It grants its host body immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed creature’s statistics and actions instead of its own. It doesn’t gain access to the creature’s memories but does gain access to its proficiencies, nonmagical class features and traits, and nonmagical actions. The ghost can’t use

limited-used abilities or class traits that require spending a resource. **Success or Critical Success.** The ghost leaves its host. If the book is within 60 feet, the ghost is forced back into it, and the trap resets.

Otherwise, the ghost appears next to the target. The target is then immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours.

**Ghost Trap Variant: Demon Trap** *Variable tier (elite constructed trap)* **Challenge** varies

Instead of a ghost possessing a book, a demon possesses a crown. The trap has the following alternate description and feature:

*The area is filled with a sense of foreboding and dread. An onyx altar caked with blood and scratched with occult symbols squats in the center of the space. On the altar rests a fire-blackened skull wearing a jeweled crown.*

***Crown.*** The crown is possessed by a **demon** instead of a ghost. A *detect magic* spell cast on the crown reveals auras of abjuration and conjuration magic; a *detect evil and good* spell reveals the presence of fiends. Spells and magical effects that target undead have no effect on the trap, while effects that target fiends work normally.

Otherwise, the trap functions identically to a Ghost Trap. If a creature dies while possessed by the demon, its soul is dragged to the Abyss; the creature can't be resurrected by any means short of a *wish* or *true resurrection* spell.

The trap is elite and has a challenge rating equal to the demon’s Challenge Rating. Use the Trap Statistics table to determine the trap’s DC and XP values, or use one of the following examples.

**Hezrou Trap:** Challenge 9 (10,000 XP); DC 17/15

**Nalfeshnee Trap:** Challenge 14 (23,000 XP); DC 20/16

**Balor Trap:** Challenge 19 (44,000 XP); DC 22/17

Gnashing Teeth Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

*A bust of a fanged frog protrudes from an iron door. The door’s handle is positioned inside the frog’s open mouth.*

Turning the handle triggers a Critical Failure.

***Exploration.*** An Engineering or Investigation check reveals that the frog’s mouth is hinged. The door is latched shut and the handle must be turned to open it. A Perception check or an examination of the fangs reveals faint, rust-brown blood stains. ***Frog Head.*** The frog head can be attacked. It has AC 19, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Its mouth can be propped open with any solid object strong enough to survive the trap’s damage. ***Keeping Clear.*** Magic (such as the *mage hand* cantrip), a long pole, or a similar item can be used to trigger the trap from a distance, resulting in a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable the trap.
* A creature can make a Dexterity check to turn the handle without triggering the trap.
* A creature can make a Strength check to hold open the mouth while another creature turns the handle. On a failure, both creatures are subjected to the trap.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The frog’s mouth snaps shut, making a melee attack with a +7 bonus against any creature or object inside the mouth. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and is trapped as the frog’s mouth clamps down on it. While trapped, the creature’s Speed becomes 0. A creature can use an action to make

a Strength check, prying open the mouth and freeing a trapped creature or object on a success. If this check fails, the trapped target takes an additional 2 (1d4) piercing damage. Once the handle is turned, the door is unlatched and can be pushed open.

**Success.** The trap isn’t triggered, and the handle can be turned.

**Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Gnashing Teeth Variants: Other Gnashing Teeth**

Instead of a frog’s head guarding a door handle, the gnashing teeth may be:

* A demonic face on a treasure chest; the chest’s lock is in the demon’s fanged mouth. The trap is triggered when the wrong key or a lockpick is inserted into the lock. The chest contains a Boon or Discovery.
* A wall-mounted, bronze shark head with a small treasure (or a Boon or Discovery) in its mouth. The trap is triggered when the treasure is removed.

**Guilty Soul Trap**

3rd tier (supernatural trap)

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); **DC** 18/15

*A statue of a stern angelic figure looms over the interior of this room. An ornate sign outside the room reads “Repent.”*

A creature that enters the room without first reciting a prayer of penitence triggers a Failure.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by transmutation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the statue requires a spellcasting ability check and triggers a

Success for the next creature to enter the room.

***Statue.*** The statue is made of solid bronze but has been painted to appear eerily lifelike. It holds a thick tome in one hand and a scythe in the other.

***Spell Solve.*** A creature under the effects of a *nondetection* spell can pass through the room without incident.

**Possible Solutions.**

* A creature can make a Religion check to recite the proper prayers of contrition before passing by the angelic statue. The prayers take 1 minute to recite, but once completed the character can pass the statue safely for 24 hours.

**Critical Failure.** The statue animates, shouting “Impenitent wretch!” and swinging its scythe at the triggering creature. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) slashing damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

**Failure.** A creature that enters the room without demonstrating proper contrition is knocked prone, is stunned for 1 minute, and suffers a level of strife. The statue then demands that the creature confess their most serious misdeed. At this point, the Narrator should ask the player what their character’s most serious misdeed is and what the character tells the statue. If the answers match, the statue magically amplifies the creature’s confession so that it is audible within 300 feet. The statue says “Be cleansed” and deals 10 (3d6) radiant damage to the creature, who is then allowed to rise and depart. Lying to the statue or otherwise failing to make an

earnest confession triggers a Critical Failure.

**Success.** The creature is allowed to pass by the statue in peace.

**Critical Success.** The statue casts *bless* on the creature as it passes. The effect lasts for 10 minutes.

Hidden Pit Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

*The floor ahead is rough and uneven.*

The floor is stone-covered plaster or flimsy wood concealing a 30-foot-deep pit. Placing more than 300 pounds of weight on the floor (typically by two or more Medium creatures walking on it at once) triggers a Critical Failure. The pit can cover any area of floor, from a 5 by 5-foot pit blocking a narrow hallway to a 50-foot-wide pit that fills an entire room.

There’s a 25 percent chance that the pit contains the remains of previous adventurers, along with a minor treasure such as a Boon or Discovery.

***Exploration.*** A Perception or Investigation check reveals that the floor is unstable, or that there are no signs of travel through this particular area. Probing or tapping the floor above the pit reveals that the area below is hollow.

***Keeping Clear.*** Once discovered, the pit can be bridged or circumvented. The party can travel over the pit one character at a time. Only a Large creature or one wearing heavy armor triggers it on their own.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Engineering check to fortify the floor so that it supports more than 300 pounds of weight. On a failure, the floor appears to be fortified but is not.
* A creature can jump over the pit. **Critical Failure or Failure.** The pit’s cover collapses, dropping creatures and objects into the pit. The trap’s cover is destroyed, and creatures that plummet into the pit take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

**Hidden Pit Trap Variants: Other Pits**

**Challenge** varies

Pit traps are dungeon classics and appear in a lot of adventures. You can mix and match the following features to customize your pit trap. Some variants increase the pit trap’s challenge rating and the DC of checks made to discover it. You can combine multiple features: for instance, a

***locking-lidded, poison-spiked pit trap*** has a challenge rating of 7 and a DC of 17/14.

***Different Description (+0 Challenge, +0 DC).*** You can vary the description of the floor around the pit trap—the important thing is that you draw attention to the floor in your description. Other options include:

* The floor ahead is dusty and in disrepair.
* The bricks of the floor ahead are jumbled up, as if this area was recently excavated or inexpertly repaired.
* A dire bearskin rug covers the floor.
* The floor in this area looks as if it has been swept.
* A sack rests in the middle of an empty expanse of floor. (Note: The sack is bait. It contains rocks and perhaps a mocking note.)
* Ahead, a 15-foot-long board lies on the floor. (Note: The board is a bridge; walking on it doesn’t trigger the trap.)

***Acid Pit Trap (+9 Challenge, +4 DC).*** This pit is filled with acid. Creatures within 10 feet of it hear a faint hissing sound, though they can’t necessarily pinpoint its source. A Perception check or an examination of the floor allows a creature to detect a faint acrid smell and identify that the hissing comes from below.

A creature that falls into the pit takes no falling damage but is immersed in acid. A

creature that enters the acid or starts its turn in the acid takes 38 (7d10) acid damage.

***Gelatinous Cube Pit Trap (+2 Challenge,***

***+1 DC).*** This pit contains a trapped **gelatinous cube**. A creature that falls into the pit doesn’t take falling damage but enters the cube’s space.

***Lidded Pit Trap (+0 Challenge, +0 DC).*** This pit has a cover that opens like a trap door or swings on a pivot. A lidded pit trap is similar to a hidden pit trap, except that it can be triggered and reset, perhaps with a concealed lever.

***Cover.*** Once the pit is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged under the cover to prevent it from opening. Alternatively, it can be held shut magically with an *arcane lock* spell*.*

***Locking-Lidded Pit Trap (+1 Challenge,***

***+0 DC).*** This pit has a weighted or

spring-loaded cover that opens like a trap door or swings on a pivot. Once a creature has fallen into the pit, the cover automatically resets and locks to prevent the creature’s escape. While the pit is locked, it can’t be triggered.

***Lock.*** A creature outside the pit can make an Investigation check to find the hidden lever, loose brick, or catch that locks or unlocks the pit’s lid. A creature that makes an Engineering or thieves' tools check can lock or unlock the pit. Only creatures that can reach the pit’s lid can attempt this check, and the check is made with disadvantage if the creature can’t see (if they are inside the lightless pit, for example). A creature can make a Strength check to break the lock and push open the pit’s lid. The pit lid is an object with AC 20, 40 hit points, and

immunity to poison and psychic damage.

***Monster Pit Trap (+9 Challenge, +4 DC).*** Trapped at the bottom of this pit is a monster with a challenge rating between 4 and 6, such as an **elemental**, **ghost**, or **otyugh**. When approaching the pit, smells and sounds may alert the adventurers to the monster. The monster tries to keep creatures that fall into the pit from escaping. ***Spiked Pit Trap (+2 Challenge, +1 DC).***

The bottom of this pit trap is lined with 2-foot-tall metal spikes.

***Spikes.*** A creature that falls into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage.

***Poison-Spiked Pit Trap (+4 Challenge, +2 DC).*** The bottom of this pit trap is lined with 2-foot-tall, poisoned metal spikes.

***Spikes.*** A creature that falls into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. A creature that takes damage from the spikes makes a Constitution saving throw, taking an additional 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

Hourglass Room

*2nd tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 5 (3,600 XP); **DC** 15/14

*Fine sand covers the floor of this circular chamber. The only way forward is through a door on the far side of the room.*

Both the room’s entrance and the far door are positioned just above the surface of the sand. A creature that steps into the room sinks waist deep into the fine particles (Small characters sink chest deep instead). The sand is difficult terrain for creatures moving through it.

A magic sensor above the opposite door activates if a living creature enters the

room, causing a trap door in the center of the room to open. Sand begins pouring through the trap door. Roll initiative.

* **Round One:** A creature that starts its turn in the sand must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward the center of the room. A creature that enters the trapdoor’s space is pulled beneath the sand and sucked through the trap door. The creature falls 30 feet into an identically shaped room below the upper chamber, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone.
* **Round Two:** The level of sand in the upper chamber lowers; creatures standing in the chamber are now 10 feet below the doors and must make an Athletics check to reach either door.
* **Round Four:** The sand empties entirely from the upper chamber. The floor there is no longer difficult terrain.
* **Round Five:** At the start of round five, the two chambers rotate, so that the upper chamber becomes the lower chamber and vice versa. A creature in either area when the chambers rotate make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and falls prone. On a success, the creature takes half damage and doesn’t fall prone.

The trap repeats until disabled or once all living creatures leave the room. Creatures capable of flying can navigate the area safely, even when the chambers rotate.

***Walls.*** A Perception check or an examination of the room reveals that the walls of the chamber slope slightly toward the center of the area, like the sides of an hourglass.

***Doors.*** Opening the door on the far side of the upper chamber reveals a blank stone wall. An identical door in the lower chamber opens into a control room containing the enormous gear that turns the chambers, a

set of stairs that return to the landing outside the upper chamber’s entrance, and a passageway that leads deeper into the dungeon.

***Landing.*** A creature that searches the landing outside the chamber’s entrance can make an Investigation check to discover a secret door. A set of steps beyond the door descends to the control room. The stairs allow creatures to bypass the hourglass chambers.

***Sensors.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic from the sensor. There is an identical sensor in the lower chamber. Casting *dispel magic* on a magical sensor deactivates it, preventing that sensor from detecting living creatures in the area.

***Trap Door.*** A creature able to access the trap door while it is clear of sand can jam it shut with a thieves’ tools check. This prevents the sand from moving between the two chambers but doesn’t stop the chambers from rotating.

**Possible Solutions**

* The gear that turns the chambers is powerful enough to pulverize any nonmagical object caught in its teeth. A creature that jams the gear with a magic weapon, *immovable rod*, or similar item can attempt an Athletics or Sleight of Hand check.
* A creature can make an attack roll with a magical bludgeoning weapon to destroy the gear.

**Critical Failure.** The gear slips, causing the chambers to rotate every round for the next 1d4 + 1 rounds. During this time, attempts to jam or destroy the gear are made with disadvantage.

**Failure.** The gear continues turning as normal.

**Success or Critical Success.** The gear stops turning, and the chambers cease rotating. Removing an item jammed into the gear resets the trap; destroying the gear permanently disables it.

Ice-Breather Trap

3rd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP); **DC** 19/16

*A 10-foot-tall statue of a barbarian or frost giant dominates the frigid room. The statue appears to be made of ice.*

A Failure is triggered when someone within 30 feet speaks the word "ice” or when the statue is subjected to fire damage.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the statue requires a spellcasting ability check and triggers a Success.

***Statue.*** When a creature first approaches within 30 feet of the statue, a *magic mouth* spell animates the statue's mouth: "Speak not my name at any cost: a river's skin in the season of frost."

The statue is made of magical ice that doesn’t melt. It is an object with AC 13, 50 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. Damaging the statue without destroying it outright triggers a Failure.

A Perception check or an examination of the statue’s face reveals that its mouth is nearly clogged with ice crystals. **Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Arcana check to disable the statue’s magic. **Critical Failure or Failure.** The mouth releases a 30-foot cone of frigid air. Each creature in the blast makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (7d10) cold damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. The trap immediately resets.

**Success.** The trap is disabled for 24 hours.

**Critical Success.** The creature can permanently disable the trap or change the triggering word from “ice” to another word.

Illusory Balcony Trap

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*A wooden balcony runs along one side of the room at a height of 20 feet, extending 5 feet out from the wall. The broken remains of a humanoid skeleton lie at the base of a ladder connected to the balcony.*

Only the 5-foot-square sections at either end of the balcony are real. The ladder connects to the real section of balcony on one side; the other side supports a treasure chest containing a Boon or Discovery. The rest of the balcony is an illusion. A creature that tries to walk on an illusory portion triggers a Failure.

***Balcony.*** An Investigation check or touching the illusory portion of the balcony reveals it to be false. Creatures who know the balcony is an illusion can see through it. A creature that climbs the ladder can see the treasure chest across the illusory section of the balcony.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by illusion magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the balcony requires a spellcasting ability check and dispels the illusion.

***Skeleton.*** Examining the skeleton reveals that its skull has been smashed. A Medicine check or an examination of the skeleton’s skull reveals that the person died from falling.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can reach the section of balcony with the treasure chest by climbing, jumping, laying a bridge over the illusory section of balcony, or through many other methods. **Critical Failure or Failure.** The creature steps through the illusory balcony and plummets 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature avoids falling.

Intoxicating Brazier

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13 *Scented smoke wafts from four glowing braziers.*

A creature that breathes for at least 1 minute within 30 feet of a brazier triggers a Critical Failure.

***Smoke.*** Dousing a brazier with water creates a cloud of drugged steam, resulting in an immediate Critical Failure for everyone in the area. The trap is then disabled. Using magic or some other means to extinguish a brazier without water results in a Critical Success. Leaving the area, holding one’s breath, or otherwise avoiding the smoke results in a Success. A strong wind clears the smoke for 1 minute. A creature can tip over a brazier with a Strength check, triggering a Critical Success and dealing 7 (2d6) fire damage to a creature within 5 feet of the brazier on the opposite side.

***Trap.*** A creature can make a Medicine check to recognize the smell of godsmoke, an intoxicating and expensive incense. A creature that makes an Insight check or that pays close attention to others in the area can recognize small oddities in their behavior before the drug kicks in.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Survival check to extinguish the brazier. **Critical Failure or Failure.** The triggering creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature is unaffected by the godsmoke for 10 minutes. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 10 minutes. While poisoned in this way, the creature feels light-headed and overconfident.

**Success.** The creature isn’t affected by the godsmoke, and the brazier is extinguished.

**Critical Success.** As a Success, and the characters can retrieve a dose of unburned godsmoke incense, which is worth 100 gp.

Invisible Caltrops Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

*Droplets of dried blood dot the floor, as if the area was once the site of a battle.*

An area of floor is covered with large, invisible caltrops. A magically invisible chest containing a Boon or Discovery sits in the center of the area. The first time each turn a creature enters the area, it triggers a Failure.

***Caltrops.*** An Investigation check or probing the area with a pole or other object reveals the presence of the invisible caltrops. Once a creature is aware of the caltrops, it can use an action to collect or sweep the caltrops from a 5-foot-square space.

***Chest.*** A Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals a rectangular area free of dust (the section of floor beneath the invisible chest). Scattering powder or small objects in the area outlines the chest. The chest contains a Boon or Discovery (perhaps a scroll containing the *invisible object* spell).

***Spell Effect.*** This is an illusion effect created by a 3rd-level spell. Casting *dispel magic* on the caltrops dispels the illusion. ***Spell Solve.*** *Detect invisibility*, *faerie fire*, and similar spells reveal the invisible caltrops.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Investigation or Perception check to move at half speed through the area without triggering a Failure.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The triggering creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and its walking speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its turn. Thereafter, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet until it regains at least 1 hit point. A creature that knows the locations of all of the caltrops and moves at half speed through the area automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

**Success or Critical Success.** The triggering creature avoids the trap.

Lightning Bolt Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); **DC** 16/14

*A foot-tall lapis lazuli statuette of a dragon sits at the center of a copper-tiled floor.*

A creature that steps on the floor within 10 feet of the statuette triggers a Failure.

***Dragon Statue.*** The statue weighs 50 pounds and is not attached to the floor. It is worth 2,000 gp. The dragon’s mouth is open and directed towards the floor. A Perception check reveals a magical *glyph of warding* on the statuette.

If the statuette is knocked over or removed from the copper floor, the trap is disabled.

***Spell Effect.*** This is an evocation effect created by a 3rd-level spell. A *dispel magic* spell cast on the statue disables the trap. **Possible Solutions**

* A creature can jump over the copper floor, landing on the other side of the floor or onto the statuette.
* A creature can make a thieves’ tools check to create a safe path by prying up copper tiles.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** A bolt of lightning arcs from the statue's mouth to the copper floor. Each creature standing on any part of the copper floor must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Once the trap has been triggered, it is permanently disabled.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is not triggered.

**Lightning-Blast Statue**

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); **DC** 14/14

*A life-size statue of a humanoid stands atop a squat marble plinth. In one hand, the statue holds an amber-tipped scepter leveled at the room’s entrance.*

A creature that approaches within 10 feet of the statue’s scepter or starts its turn in that area triggers a Failure.

***Exploration.*** A Perception check or an examination of the statue reveals that the scepter can be removed from the statue’s hand. A riddle is written in Common on the scepter: “I am the Prince’s to command / Until another comes to hand.”

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the scepter requires a spellcasting ability check and disables the trap.

***Statue.*** A creature can push the statue off the plinth with an Athletics check. On a success, the statue shatters against the floor. The statue is a nonmagical object with AC 14, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. While the statue holds the amber-tipped scepter, it also has immunity to lightning damage. Shattering the statue or reducing it to 0 hit points disables the trap.

**Possible Solutions**

* To disable the trap, the statue’s scepter must be swapped with an

object of similar size, such as a magical rod, a weapon, or even a torch. Simply removing the scepter from the statue does not deactivate the trap; the scepter continues firing so long as it remains within 500 feet of the statue. A creature can make a Sleight of Hand check to replace the scepter without activating the lightning.

**Critical Failure.** As a Failure, except the lightning targets each creature within 10 feet of the scepter.

**Failure.** A bolt of lightning arcs from the end of the scepter. The triggering creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature safely swaps out the scepter, disabling the trap.

Lock Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*A sturdy metal door features a boxy lock studded with sharp rivets.* (Note: The lock may be on a chest instead, in which case the chest contains a Boon or Discovery.)

Attempting to pick the lock with thieves’ tools triggers Critical Failure. Any other method of opening the lock results in a Success. (As is the case with most locks, there is a decent chance the key is somewhere nearby!)

***Exploration.*** An Engineering or Investigation check reveals that the keyhole is large enough to contain a trap. A Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals a drop of dried blood on the floor near the lock.

***Lock.*** A creature can make an Investigation or thieves' tools check to probe the lock for traps. This check is made with advantage. On a success, the creature identifies the trap and makes Dexterity checks to disable

the trap with advantage. Failing the check triggers a Critical Failure.

The lock can be smashed with a DC

1. Strength check or by attacking it (AC 19,
2. hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).

***Protection.*** A character wearing gauntlets is immune to the trap’s damage but has disadvantage on Dexterity checks to pick the lock.

***Spell Solve.*** *Knock* unlocks the door but does not disable the trap.

**Possible Solutions**

A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable the trap.

**Critical Failure.** A blade extends from the lock, jabbing at the fingers of a would-be lockpicker. The triggering creature takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage. A creature damaged by the blade has disadvantage on Dexterity checks involving manual dexterity (such as disarming traps) until it regains at least 1 hit point.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, except the blade deals 2 (1d4) slashing damage.

**Success.** The trap is disabled. **Critical Success.** The trap is disabled, and the door is unlocked.

**Lock Trap Variant: Paralysis Needle Trap**

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP); **DC** 15/14

This trap is armed with paralysis poison. It has the following alternate description and Critical Failure and Failure condition:

*The middle of this locked wooden door is set with a metal plate. The plate is etched with an image of a skull with a lolling forked tongue. The skull's nose is the keyhole.*

**Critical Failure or Failure.** A

tongue-shaped blade extends from the lock, jabbing at the fingers of a would-be lockpicker. The triggering creature takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage. A creature damaged by the blade makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Also on a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is paralyzed.

**Lock Trap Variant: Scorpion Needle Trap**

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); **DC** 14/14

This trap is armed with poison extracted from a giant scorpion. It has the following alternate description and Critical Failure and Failure conditions:

*A jumble of bones leans against a locked door.*

***Critical Failure or Failure.*** A needle extends from the lock, jabbing at the fingers of a would-be lockpicker. The triggering creature takes 1 piercing damage. A creature damaged by the blade makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

**Lock Trap Variant: Plague Gas lock**

*3rd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 14 (11,500 XP); **DC** 20/16 This trap has the following alternate

description and Critical Failure and Failure conditions:

*This iron door’s lock resembles a skull; the skull’s nose functions as the keyhole.*

**Critical Failure.** A 15-foot cone of diseased air blasts from the lock. Each creature in the area makes a Constitution saving throw.

Creatures within 5 feet of the lock make this saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic

damage and contracts slimy doom (see the *contagion* spell). On a success, the creature takes half damage and doesn’t contract the disease.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, except the cone of diseased air is 5 feet.

**Lock Trap Variant: Shock Lock** *2nd tier (constructed trap)* **Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); **DC** 17/15 This trap has the following alternate

description and Critical Failure and Failure conditions:

*A locked wooden door has a copper lock.* **Critical Failure.** The creature’s lockpick touches an electrically charged filament. The triggering creature makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Also on a failure, lightning arcs to each other creature within 15 feet of the triggering creature. Each other creature makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. The trap is then deactivated until a crank on the opposite side of the door is turned, recharging the filament.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, except the lightning doesn’t arc to additional creatures.

Magic Comet Trap

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP); **DC** 17/15

*A mosaic of a burning city menaced by five comets covers the floor. The name "Ab Aldriz" is worked into the mosaic, as is a mysterious sigil that covers nearly the entire mosaic.*

A creature triggers a Failure when it first walks onto the sigil, or starts its turn standing on the sigil, without having spoken the words “Ab Aldriz” in the last hour.

***Ab Aldriz.*** A creature that makes a History check recalls that an ancient city was destroyed when an angry wizard named Ab Aldriz summoned comets to strike it. The wizard was angry for not having his accomplishments recognized by the city.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the sigil requires a spellcasting ability check and disables the trap.

***Sigil.*** The sigil is a large and branching symbol that stretches across the entire mosaic. A creature that makes an Arcana check recognizes it as a *glyph of warding* that triggers an unknown spell under unknown conditions.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Stealth check to walk across the mosaic without stepping on any part of the sigil. **Critical Failure or Failure.** Five miniature comets fire from the mosaic, targeting the triggering creature. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success. The trap can’t target the same creature again for 24 hours but can still target other creatures.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is not triggered.

Mirror Trap

*1st tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 4 (2,200 XP); **DC** 15/14

*A mirror hangs on the wall, its silver frame etched with strange sigils.*

The mirror reflects light normally. A living creature that touches the mirror or its frame seems to disappear as it is teleported to an extradimensional space “inside” the mirror. Creatures outside the mirror can’t see creatures trapped inside. Creatures

inside the mirror can interact with each other and can observe the area outside the mirror as if looking through a window, but they otherwise do not have line of effect to the area outside the mirror.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by conjuration magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the mirror requires a spellcasting ability check and disables the trap.

Creatures trapped inside the mirror appear in unoccupied spaces outside the mirror, and the mirror becomes a nonmagical item worth 500 gp.

***Mirror.*** A creature that makes an Arcana check knows that the sigils on the mirror’s frame produce some sort of teleportation magic when activated. A creature that investigates the mirror (without touching it) can make a Perception or Investigation check. On a success, they hear shouting or other loud sounds created by creatures trapped inside the mirror.

***Spell Solve.*** A creature trapped inside the mirror can escape using magic that allows extradimensional travel (such as *dimension door*).

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature outside the mirror can counteract the magic sigils with an Arcana check.
* A creature on either side of the mirror can shatter the mirror by making an attack roll (AC 14). **Critical Failure or Failure.** If the triggering creature is outside the mirror and within 5 feet of it, it teleports inside the mirror. An **aleas** in the form of the triggering creature appears in the creature’s space. Disabling the trap does not destroy the aleas.

**Success.** The mirror cracks. A second Success triggers a Critical Success instead.

**Critical Success.** The mirror shatters, and the trap is disabled. Creatures inside the mirror when it shatters appear in unoccupied spaces outside the mirror. The mirror’s frame becomes a nonmagical item worth 50 gp.

Necromantic Bridge

*4th tier (elite supernatural trap)* **Challenge** 18 (40,000 XP); **DC** 22/17 *A bridge made of bones spans a*

*sinister-looking pool of black water before vanishing into the waterfall that feeds the pool. The surrounding area is devoid of life. No moss grows on the walls, and no signs of vermin are present.*

A living creature that isn’t a necromancer that steps onto a section of bridge at least 20 feet from the either end triggers a Failure.

***Bridge.*** The bones making up the bridge are held together with bits of red-gray sinew. An Investigation or Perception check, observing the bridge for at least 1 minute, or witnessing a creature cross it reveals that the bridge is animated. A creature that makes an Arcana or Religion check recognizes that the bridge is friendly to undead and necromancers and grants them safe passage. Creatures carried by a construct or undead can cross the bridge safely, though they still need to deal with the waterfall.

***Water.*** Both the waterfall and the pool below are black and unwholesome looking. A creature that enters the pool or waterfall for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the water takes 54 (12d8) necrotic damage. Constructs and undead are immune to this damage. A creature that makes a Religion check suspects that the waterfall flows from one of the rivers of the dead.

Dealing at least 50 cold damage to the pool freezes it. Creatures can walk across the frozen pool without taking necrotic damage.

***Waterfall.*** Holding aloft a large flat object (such as a door or table; shields other than tower shields are too small) allows a creature to pass safely under the falls.

***Magical Effect.*** The bridge is a 9th-level necromancy effect. A successful *dispel magic* or an effect that turns undead destroys the bridge, causing it to collapse into the pool below.

***Spell Solve.*** Magic that makes a creature appear to be undead (such as *arcanist’s magic aura*) allows that creature to cross the bridge but does not shield them from the waterfall. Spells that create solid walls can make structures that allow passage under the falls. A creature protected by a *resilient sphere* can cross the bridge without touching it and can pass beneath the waterfall safely.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature that knows or has prepared at least two necromancy spells of 1st level or higher registers as a necromancer and can cross the bridge safely. The bridge forms a “covered bridge” structure that allows the creature to pass beneath the waterfall as they approach. A creature can make an Arcana or Religion check to “spoof” this necromantic capability.

**Critical Failure.** As a Failure, but the creature is first slammed against a wall or crushed in a giant, bony fist, taking an additional 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage.

**Failure.** An arm made of animated bones forms out of the bridge’s structure and attempts to shove them into the water below. The

creature must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (creature’s choice). On a failure, the creature is flung into the pool, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall, and is subjected to the effects of the water.

**Success.** The creature fools the bridge into believing it is an undead creature, a necromancer, or the like, and can cross the bridge safely.

**Critical Success.** As a Success, and the bridge treats the creature’s companions as their entourage, allowing other creatures to pass safely for the next minute.

Obsidian Tendrils Trap

4th tier (elite constructed trap)

**Challenge** 20 (50,000 XP); **DC** 23/18

*A foot-wide, foot-tall obsidian bridge spans a pool of bubbling lava.*

A creature triggers a Failure each time it enters a 5-foot space above the lava on its turn. This includes any space up to 50 feet above the lava, as well as the area of the obsidian bridge.

***Lava.*** The lava bubbles and ripples as if stirred from within. A creature that enters a space within 5 feet of the lava or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) ongoing fire damage. An Investigation or Perception check, or observing the pool for 1 minute, reveals black tendrils that occasionally emerge from the surface of the lava.

Dealing at least 50 cold damage to the pool in a single turn causes a

5-foot-square area of the lava to harden into solid obsidian for 1 minute, during which time that area is safe to traverse.

The Narrator determines the size of the pool, but it should be at least 30 feet on a side and offer no obvious route around it.

The larger the pool, the more difficult the challenge.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by transmutation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the lava requires a spellcasting ability check and dispels the effect on a 5-foot-square area of lava.

**Possible Solutions**

* An Acrobatics or Athletics check allows a creature to move or fly above the lava at half its speed without triggering Failures until the end of its turn.
* As an action, a creature can make an Investigation, Nature, or Perception check to watch the surface of the lava. On a success, the creature identifies a safe route across the pool. Until the start of its next turn, the creature can use its reaction to grant itself or a creature that can hear it a Critical Success against the trap.
* A creature can take the Ready action to ready a melee attack against an obsidian tendril. The first time before the start of the creature’s next turn that it makes a Strength saving throw against an obsidian tendril, it can use its reaction to make a melee attack against the vine (AC 18). On a hit, the creature triggers a Success. On a failure, the creature must make the saving throw as normal.

**Critical Failure.** As a Failure, but the creature makes the Strength saving throw to avoid the obsidian tendril with disadvantage.

**Failure.** A jagged tendril made of animated obsidian emerges from the lava to grasp the creature. The creature makes a Strength saving

throw. On a failure, it takes 11 (2d10) slashing damage and is restrained. The tendril then pulls the restrained creature to within 5 feet of the lava. A creature can use an action to make a Strength check, freeing a restrained creature on a success.

The tendrils are objects with AC 18, 50 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. Once a tendril has been destroyed, moving into the 5-foot-square area it guards no longer triggers a Failure. **Success.** The creature avoids the tendril.

**Critical Success.** The creature avoids the tendril and automatically succeeds on Strength saving throws against this trap until the end of its turn.

Oil Pool Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); **DC** 14/14

*The entire floor of this area is sunken and filled with two feet of water. A 12-inch-wide metal grate is set into the ceiling above the pool.*

A layer of lamp oil floats atop the water. If a lit torch or candle is dropped into the water (perhaps by a creature hiding above the metal grate), a Failure is triggered.

***Grate.*** A Perception check or an examination of the ceiling around the grate reveals that the ceiling is blackened with soot. An Engineering check or an examination of the grate reveals that it can be removed by someone standing in the pool. A creature that reaches the grate can push it up and squeeze through the

foot-wide opening into a tiny crawl space. The crawl space might be empty or contain a hostile creature holding a candle and a

flint and steel. The crawl space might also contain a Boon or Treasure.

***Pool.*** An Investigation check, or tasting the water, reveals that it is covered with a thin layer of lamp oil. Depending on the size of the area, creatures might need to wade through the oily water to reach an exit, but it might be possible to jump over the pool.

Entering the pool doesn’t trigger a Failure. Igniting the oil triggers a Failure—which might be desirable if there is no one in the pool at the time.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The oil atop the water ignites and burns for 1 round. A creature in the pool or up to 5 feet above it when the oil ignites takes 10 (3d6) ongoing fire damage. A creature can end this ongoing damage early by diving into the water or by using an action to extinguish the fire on itself. A creature that is totally submerged in the water is immune to the damage. Once the fire has burned itself out, the trap is disabled.

Poison-Dart Skulls Trap

3rd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP); **DC** 19/16

*In the center of the room, a 3-foot-tall skull sits atop a carpeted dais. Something glints inside the skull’s single, huge eye socket. Human-sized skulls, each also with one eye, are set into the walls.*

Stepping onto the huge skull’s dais triggers a Failure.

***Central Skull.*** A creature that makes a History or Nature check identifies the large skull as that of a cyclops. An examination of the skull reveals a Boon or Discovery inside it, easily retrievable by reaching its eye socket.

***Dais.*** The dais is two steps high and covered with faded red carpet. An

Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the dais or carpet, reveals that the carpet conceals pressure plates that activate when weight is put on the dais. ***Wall Skulls.*** A Perception check, or an examination of the wall-mounted skulls, reveals that the skulls are artificial and that their eyes are tubes that extend into the wall. A creature can make an Engineering or Sleight of Hand check to plug or otherwise disable one of the four smaller skulls’ eye sockets, removing one dart from the trap’s barrage. On a failure, the creature only believes the eye hole has been disabled.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable the pressure plates. **Critical Failure or Failure.** A dart fires from each of the four

wall-mounted skulls. Each dart makes a ranged attack with a +8 bonus against a random target in the room. A target hit by a dart takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage and makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

Poison Gas Trap

1st tier (elite constructed trap)

**Challenge** 3 (1,400 XP); **DC** 14/14

*A grimacing stone mask with jade eyes is set 15 feet up on the wall.*

Each time an eye is removed, a Failure is triggered.

***Mask.*** A Perception check or an examination of the mask’s jade eyes reveals that the eyes are carved to fit inside the mask but are not attached to it. Each gem is worth 100 gp. An Investigation check

reveals a faint noxious smell near the mask’s mouth. Examining the mouth reveals that the teeth are not particularly sharp or covered with poison, and that the mouth isn’t hinged and can’t close.

The mask is an object with AC 17, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Breaking it ruptures the cavity holding the poison gas, triggering a Failure.

***Spell Solve.*** An eye can be removed from a distance with *mage hand* or a similar effect. A strong wind (such as *gust of wind*) reduces the poison cloud’s diameter by 20 feet. If this reduces its diameter to 0 feet, the trap is disabled.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** A hissing sound is heard as gas seeps into the area through the mask’s mouth. Roll initiative. On initiative count 10, a 30-foot-diameter cloud of gas emanates from the mask, spreading around corners. Each round on initiative count 10 for the next minute, the size of the cloud increases by 10 feet, to a maximum of 120 feet. A creature that starts its turn within the cloud makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and is poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn’t poisoned. A creature can make a Sleight of Hand check to jam the eye back into the hole, disabling the trap and preventing the poison cloud from growing larger. Another object of similar size can be jammed into the hole with a Sleight of Hand check, but the check is made with disadvantage if the object isn’t an exact fit.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap isn’t triggered.

**Poison Gas Trap Variant: Green Dragon Poison Gas Trap**

*2nd tier (elite constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 13 (20,000 XP); **DC** 19/16

This trap is armed with young green dragon poison. Instead of a mask, the area contains a 15-foot-tall stone statue of a dragon with emerald eyes worth 1,000 gp each. The cloud deals 42 (12d6) poison damage instead of 14 (4d6) poison damage.

**Poison Gas Trap Variant: Sleep Gas Trap**

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 3 (1,400 XP); **DC** 14/14

Instead of a jade mask, the room contains a dust-covered bed with a gold brocade canopy and a faded bed skirt. An inanimate skeleton lies atop the bed.

A creature that fails a Constitution saving throw against the poison takes no damage but is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned, the target is also unconscious. An unconscious creature repeats the saving throw whenever it takes damage.

Instead of the Mask and Spell Solve features, the trap has the following feature: ***Bed.*** The gold brocade canopy is worth 100 gp. Changing the bed’s weight significantly—for instance, by climbing onto the bed or removing the canopy—triggers a pressure plate under one of the bed’s legs.

An Investigation check or looking under the bed reveals the pressure plate.

Ratling-Catcher Trap

1st tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); **DC** 15/14

*The passage features two gates made of metal bars; the first is open while the second, 10 feet farther down the passage, is closed.*

The second (farther) gate is locked.

When a creature jostles, hits, or tries to open or close either gate, a Failure is triggered.

***Gates.*** Both gates are objects with AC 19, 30 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and a damage threshold of 10. The gaps between the bars are 6 inches wide. Each gate bears a lock that automatically engages when the gate is closed. An Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the hinges, reveals that jostling a gate could set off mechanisms built into the hinges.

A single key unlocks both gates. The trap is disabled while the key is in either lock.

***Spell Solve.*** *Knock* opens one gate.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength check to bend or break a gate’s bars, creating a space wide enough to allow passage.
* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to unlock a gate. On a critical success, the creature unlocks the gate, allowing that gate to be opened and closed without triggering a Failure.
* A creature can make an Engineering check to disable the mechanism on one gate, allowing it to be opened and closed without triggering a Failure. On a critical success, the gate is also unlocked.
* A Sleight of Hand check allows a creature to open or close an unlocked gate without triggering a Failure.
* A creature can make an Acrobatics check to contort through the bars. **Critical Failure or Failure.** If either gate is open or unlocked, it swings shut and locks.

When a gate closes, a creature within 5 feet of it can make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the gate closes and locks as usual. On a success, the character prevents the gate from closing this turn, although the trap is still active. A large, sturdy object propped in the gateway also prevents the gate from closing.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature succeeds in their attempt.

**Ratling-Catcher Trap Variant: Electrified Ratling-Catcher Trap**

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP); **DC** 15/14

On a Failure, in addition to the other effects, electricity courses briefly through the metal gates. Each creature touching either gate (either directly or with a metal object) takes 2 (1d4) lightning damage. On a Critical Failure, the damage increases to 5 (2d4) lightning damage.

Reverse Gravity Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); **DC** 15/14

*The walls are covered with floor-to-ceiling bookcases. On the ceiling, metal spikes hang down like icicles.*

Gravity is reversed in this room. An unsecured creature or object that enters the room triggers a Failure. (Note: If this room contains creatures, they stand on the ceiling.)

***Exploration.*** A Perception check or an examination of the bookshelves reveals that the books are shelved upside down against the tops of their shelves. The ceiling is 30 feet high. The bookshelves look easy to climb.

***Books.*** As an action, a creature can make an Arcana or Investigation check to scan

the bookshelves. On a success, the creature notices a spellbook (containing *levitate* or another 2nd-level spell) on a shelf across the room.

***Spell Effect.*** This is a transmutation effect created by a 7th-level spell. A successful *dispel magic* disables the trap.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Athletics or Acrobatics check to climb along the bookcases. The check is made with advantage if the creature is upside down (i.e. right side up relative to the room’s gravity).

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The creature or object falls to the ceiling. Creatures that can levitate or fly don’t fall. The room’s ceiling is 30 feet high, so a creature that falls from the floor takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall. A creature that takes falling damage also takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage from the spikes on the ceiling.

Once on the ceiling, a creature can move around the spikes safely but treats the area as difficult terrain.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature moves through the room safely until the end of its turn.

**Reverse Gravity Trap Variant: Random Gravity Trap**

This room is identical in appearance to the Reverse Gravity Trap except that it has an upside-down door on the wall adjoining the ceiling.

Roll initiative. Each round on initiative count 20, gravity reverses direction. Each unsecured creature and object in the room when gravity changes falls up or down, as appropriate. Creatures take falling damage and spike damage

when falling up, and falling damage only when falling down. A creature holding onto the bookshelves when gravity reverses must make a Dexterity saving throw or lose its grip.

Once a creature has noticed the location of the spellbook, the next two successful Arcana or Investigation checks reveal the locations of other valuable books, each containing a spell, information, or a Boon or Discovery.

Rolling Icosahedron

3rd tier (elite constructed trap) **Challenge** 13 (10,000 XP); **DC** 19/16 *At the top of a dais sits a 5-foot-tall,*

*20-sided stone. Each triangular facet is tiled with a mosaic depicting a crowned humanoid.*

If a creature approaches within 30 feet of the stone without swearing allegiance to the ancient empire that crafted it, the stone begins to magically roll of its own accord. Roll initiative. Each round on initiative count 15, the stone takes an action based on the nature of the portrait that is currently uppermost on the stone—smiling, frowning, or shouting. On the stone’s first turn, a frowning mosaic portrait is currently uppermost. At the end of each of its turns, roll a d20 to determine what action the stone takes on its next turn.

The stone magically senses the locations of living creatures within 60 feet. The stone moves in straight lines and can move up slopes as steep as 45 degrees. If a creature or object stands between the stone and its destination, the stone collides with the obstacle. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to jump out of the stone’s path or a Strength saving throw to halt the stone’s progress. On a failed save, the creature takes 49 (14d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.. If this

damage reduces the obstacle to 0 hit points, the stone continues its movement.

Otherwise, its movement ends for the turn.

**1–5 Shouting Face:** The stone moves 60 feet in the direction of the closest creature within 60 feet. When the stone stops moving, it emits a burst of flame. Each creature within 30 feet makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

**6–15 Frowning Face:** The stone moves 60 feet in the direction of the closest creature within 60 feet. Each time the stone moves within 5 feet of a creature, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failure or half damage on a success.

**16–20 Smiling Face:** The stone moves 30 feet in the direction of the closest creature within 30 feet. The first time the stone moves within 5 feet of a creature, it stops moving and emits a blue glow that magically restores 10 (3d6) hit points to that creature. The stone doesn’t move again until the next round.

If there are no creatures within 60 feet of the stone at the start of its turn, it moves 60 feet towards its original position. Once at its original location, the trap resets. ***Icosahedron.*** The stone is an icosahedron—a shape with 20 sides. A creature that makes a History check knows that the portraits represent twenty emperors from a long-past empire. On a critical success, the creature remembers that the stone was used to secure palaces against traitors.

The stone is an object with AC 19, 400 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning, force, and thunder damage. ***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation and transmutation

magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the icosahedron requires a spellcasting ability check and disables the face that’s currently uppermost, dispelling that effect only. For instance, while a shouting portrait is uppermost, *dispel magic* causes any future rolls of 1–5 to have no effect. If the shouting and frowning effects are dispelled, the stone stops moving and the trap is disabled.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength check to move the sphere. On a success, the stone is pushed up to 10 feet, and its uppermost face is rerolled as if it had ended its turn.
* A creature can make an Engineering check to create an obstacle. The obstacle’s AC and hit points are determined by the objects used to create it.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The attempt has no effect.

**Success or Critical Success.** The attempt is successful.

**Sacred Flame Gem Trap** *0th tier (elite constructed trap)* **Challenge** 2 (900 XP); **DC** 14/13

*A marble pedestal heaped with treasure stands in the center of the room. Floating a few inches above the treasure is a fist-sized gem etched with a holy symbol.*

A creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the gem and within line of sight triggers a Critical Failure.

***Exploration.*** A creature that makes an Arcana check suspects that the gem won’t fire at creatures not in its line of sight. A creature that makes a Religion check recognizes the deity associated with the gem’s holy symbol and knows that the god’s followers sometimes use such gems to guard sacred treasures from the unfaithful.

***Gem.*** The gem is sacred to a particular deity and does not fire at creatures visibly wearing that god’s holy symbol. Covering the gem (with a bedroll or similar object) prevents the gem from firing. Moving the gem 30 feet away from its pedestal triggers a Critical Success.

***Spell Effect.*** This is an evocation effect created by a 1st-level spell.

**Possible Solutions**

* The gem is an object with AC 20, 10 hit points, and immunity to piercing, psychic, and poison damage. Attacking the gem without destroying it outright triggers a Failure. Destroying the gem disables the trap.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The gem fires a beam of radiant energy at the triggering creature. The creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (1d8) radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

**Success.** The trap is disabled for 1 round. Any Success triggered during this time counts as a Critical Success.

**Critical Success.** The trap is disabled. The gem magically shrinks and becomes a nonmagical gem worth 100 gp.

Shock Door Trap

*0th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

*A copper-handled wooden door is branded with an arcane glyph.*

Touching the copper door handle (either directly or with a metal object) triggers a Critical Failure.

***Glyph.*** A creature that makes an Arcana check recognizes that the glyph is a *glyph of warding* that holds a spell (a powerful version of *shocking grasp*).

***Handle.*** The door handle crackles and emits sparks if an object touches it. A creature can turn the handle safely by wrapping it in thick leather or another nonconductive material, or by using *mage hand* or another long-distance method, triggering a Success.

***Magical Effect.*** This is a magical effect created by evocation magic. Casting *dispel magic* on the glyph triggers a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength check to force open the door without touching the handle, or an ability check with thieves’ or carpenters’ tools to remove the door from its hinges.
* A creature can attack the door with a bludgeoning weapon.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The triggering creature takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage, and the trap resets.

**Success or Critical Success.** The creature is not shocked, and the trap is disabled.

Sigil Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); **DC** 14/14

*A foot-tall, blue-glowing sigil is engraved on a stone door.*

Touching the door triggers a Failure.

***Sigil.*** A creature that makes an Arcana check recognizes the rune as a symbol for “lightning” and knows how to pronounce the rune. If a creature fails this Arcana check by 5 or more, they recognize the rune but their pronunciation of the rune is incorrect. An examination of the rune reveals that it

crackles with electricity. A creature that makes a History check knows that mages often use runes to booby-trap their possessions.

A creature that correctly pronounces the rune disables it for 1 minute. A creature that mispronounces the name of the rune triggers a Failure.

***Spell Effect.*** This is an evocation effect created by a 3rd-level spell. *Dispel magic* triggers a Critical Success.

***Spell Solve.*** Using magic like *mage hand* to open the door triggers a Success.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make an Arcana or thieves' tools check to disable the rune.

**Critical Failure or Failure.** The door blazes with lightning. Each creature within 5 feet of it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success. The trap is then disabled for 1 minute.

**Success.** The door can be opened once without triggering the trap.

**Critical Success.** The trap is permanently disabled.

**Sigil Trap Variants: Other Elements**

Sigil traps exist that bear sigils with different names and shapes. Each glows a different color and deals a different damage type. For instance, a fire sigil trap glows orange.

**Sigil Trap Variant: Sigil Sequence Trap**

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP); **DC** 17/15

Instead of a single sigil, the trapped surface is inscribed with a line of three sigils. All three sigils must be disabled separately to disable the trap. When this trap is triggered, it deals 42 (12d6) lightning damage on a failed Dexterity saving throw, or half

damage on a success. For each deactivated sigil, the damage is reduced by 14 (4d6).

Each creature that fails the saving throw is teleported to a specific location elsewhere in the dungeon. This is a 5th-level evocation effect. Until this trap is completely disabled, it can be used as a permanent teleportation circle by creatures that have seen the sigils.

Snake Hatch

0th tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP); **DC** 14/13

*A 1-foot-tall stone door has no visible means of opening it.*

A lever in a different room, possibly the next room the party explores, opens and closes the stone hatch with a grinding sound that’s audible for 100 feet. When the hatch opens, a **giant constrictor snake** slips out and begins stealthily hunting. This trap might be triggered by creatures in the next room while the adventurers are near the hatch, or the adventurers might find the lever and release the hungry snake themselves. In either case, they are likely to be its first choice of prey.

The alcove behind the hatch may hold a Boon or Discovery.

***Hatch Room.*** An Engineering check in the hatch room, or an examination of the stone hatch, reveals no opening or closing mechanism nearby. A Perception or Survival check in the hatch room, or an examination of the floor, reveals traces of the monster (such as tracks or odd smells) near the hatch.

Forcing open the hatch requires a DC 20 Strength check. It is an object with AC 20, 40 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Blocking the hatch with a heavy object prevents the monster from emerging.

***Lever Room.*** An Engineering check in the lever room, or an examination of the lever, suggests that such levers are often used to operate counterweight doors or similar mechanisms. A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable the mechanism.

**Snake Hatch Variant: Green Slime Trap**

*2nd tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP); **DC** 14/14

The hatch is on the ceiling. Instead of a snake, the trap holds **green slime**, which drops on a creature directly beneath the hatch.

**Snake Hatch Variant: Black Pudding Trap**

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP); **DC** 15/14

The trap holds a **black pudding** instead of a snake.

**Snake Hatch Variant: Crusher Trap** *2nd tier (constructed trap)* **Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP); **DC** 18/15 The hatch is large. The trap holds a **crusher** instead of a snake.

**Snake Hatch Variant: Minotaur Champion Trap**

*4th tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 17 (18,000 XP); **DC** 21/17 The hatch is large. The trap holds a **minotaur champion** instead of a snake. The minotaur champion may be skeletal (see **skeleton**).

Spear Trap

*1st tier (constructed trap)*

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13

*The wall of the hallway bears a painting of a spear-wielding knight fighting a dragon. In the middle of the knight's chest is a small round hole ringed with painted blood.*

A hidden pressure plate is set into the floor beneath the hole. Stepping on the pressure plate triggers a Critical Failure.

***Floor.*** A Perception check or an examination of the floor reveals the pressure plate.

***Hole.*** A creature that investigates the hole at close range may trigger the trap. A bright light shone into the hole reveals a glint of metal. A solid object, like a shield, held in

front of the hole takes damage in place of the triggering creature.

***Opposite Wall.*** An examination of the walls reveals a nick in the stone wall opposite the hole.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable the pressure plate. **Critical Failure or Failure.** A spear juts from the hole, making a melee attack with a +5 bonus against the triggering creature. On a hit, the target takes 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. On a miss, the spear slams into the opposite wall.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Spear Trap Variants: Other Spear Traps** Instead of a painting of a knight, the spear trap may be concealed in the following ways:

* A wooden chest is pushed against a wall, below a ragged tapestry depicting a dragon resting on a pile of treasure. (The spear hole is hidden behind the tapestry. The chest contains a Boon or Discovery.)
* An otherwise blank wall has a small tube protruding from it. A cork balances on the end of the tube. (The trap can’t be triggered if the cork is inserted into the tube. The protruding spear is a magical *+1 spear*, and the trap makes its attack and damage rolls with a +1 bonus. Once the trap is triggered, the spear can be taken.)
* A red circle is painted on the floor. A Perception check or an examination of the ceiling reveals a small hole in the ceiling above the circle. (The spear projects from the hole,

targeting any creature standing on the red circle.)

Supercharged Metal Cube

4th tier (elite constructed trap) **Challenge** 16 (30,000 XP); **DC** 21/17 *Multiple arcs of lightning connect a*

*10-foot-tall metal cube to a wall-mounted sword and a brazier.*

A creature or metal object that moves within 30 feet of the contraption on its turn or starts its turn there triggers a Failure.

***Cube.*** An Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the cube, reveals that it is riveted together. Examining the cube from above reveals a trapdoor on the top face of the cube.

The cube is a nonmagical object with AC 17, 100 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. *Disintegrate* destroys it. Damaging the cube without destroying it outright triggers a Critical Failure.

***Lightning.*** A Perception check, or an examination of the objects connected by arcs of lightning, reveals that all the objects are made of metal. A metal object thrown within 30 feet of the cube becomes connected to the cube by an arc of lightning.

Arcs of lightning can be blocked by non-metal objects. A creature can approach the cube safely if protected by an object made of stone, wood, or similar material that is at least 1 inch thick.

***Sword.*** At the Narrator’s discretion, the sword may be a magic weapon, such as a *flame tongue* sword that deals lightning instead of fire damage.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature that can get close enough to the cube can attempt a thieves' tools check to remove a panel from the side of the cube. The trapdoor in

the top of the cube can be opened without a check. In either case, a floating, glowing mote of elemental lightning is revealed, set into a slot within the cube. Touching the mote (either directly or with a metal object) triggers a Failure. A creature that pries out the mote with a non conductive object, such as a wooden stake, or that triggers a Failure and succeeds on their saving throw, can remove the mote from the slot.

Removing it from the slot disables the trap. Once removed, the mote can be attuned to, in which case it functions as a *wand of lightning*. **Critical Failure.** Each creature and metal object within 60 feet of the cube is subjected to a Failure.

**Failure.** Lightning arcs to the triggering object or creature. If it is an object, it takes no damage but any creature that touches it triggers a failure. If it is a creature, it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Also on a failed save, a creature is pushed 30 feet away from the cube and knocked prone. The lightning does not go around corners.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap isn’t triggered.

Sword Guardian Trap

2nd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP); **DC** 16/14

*A black metal statue stands in the middle of a hallway. The statue depicts a woman with four arms and the lower body of a snake.*

*The statue holds swords in three of her hands; the fourth holds out a basket in your direction.*

Pressure plates cover the floor within 5 feet of the side and rear of the statue. Stepping on a pressure plate or jostling the statue triggers a Failure. The pressure plates are disabled while the basket holds at least 10 pounds of weight. ***Floor.*** An Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the floor, reveals that the floor next to and behind the statue is composed of pressure plates. The statue can be approached safely from the front.

***Statue.*** Any investigation of the statue reveals that the words “Pay Your Respects” are engraved at the bottom of the basket. A character that makes an Arcana or Religion check recognizes the statue as a marilith, a type of demon. An Investigation check, or an examination of the statue, reveals that the marilith has articulated arms.

The statue is an object with AC 19, 75 hit points, and immunity to cold, lightning, fire, piercing, poison, and psychic damage. Damaging the statue without destroying it outright triggers a Critical Failure.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to disable one pressure plate or one of the statue’s arms.
* A creature can make a Strength check to break one pressure plate or one of the statue’s arms.

**Critical Failure.** The statue makes three melee attacks, each with a different arm. Each arm attacks with a +7 bonus, has a reach of 10 feet, and deals 9 (2d8) slashing damage on a hit.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, but only one arm attacks.

**Success.** One pressure plate or one arm is disabled. Disabling three

pressure plates or arms triggers a Critical Success.

**Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

**Sword Guardian Variant: Sword Guardian Riddler**

The message at the bottom of the sword guardian’s bowl is a riddle. An appropriate item placed in the bowl disables the trap; other items do not.

* “Golden head bearing a crown, golden tail up or down.” The trap is disabled if one or more gold coins is placed in the bowl.
* “Born in fire, formed in water, polished silver, end in slaughter.” The trap is disabled if a weapon made of iron or steel is placed in the bowl.

Symbol of Death Trap

3rd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP); **DC** 18/15

*A black iron door is engraved with a silver skull. Words on the door read: “Only my servants shall pass unharmed.”*

The door is inscribed with a

hard-to-spot *symbol* of death. Opening or breaking the door triggers a Failure. The trap isn’t triggered if the door is opened by a creature holding a skull, wearing the image of a skull, or even using a mirror to reflect the skull on the door. Other methods, such as disguising oneself as an undead creature, might also allow the door to be opened safely.

***Door.*** The door is iron. A creature that makes an Arcana or Religion check suspects that the door might bear a trap that can be bypassed by creatures that appear to be death’s servants.

***Glyph.*** An Investigation check reveals a tiny magical glyph. Once the glyph is

discovered, a creature that makes an Arcana or Religion check can identify it as one created by the *symbol* spell.

***Spell Effect.*** This is an abjuration effect created by a 7th-level spell. A *dispel magic* cast on the glyph disables the trap.

**Possible Solutions**

* Once the glyph is discovered, a creature can make an Arcana or Religion check to disable its magic. **Critical Failure or Failure.** The glyph begins to glow, shedding dim light in a 60-foot radius for 10 minutes. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) necrotic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. At the end of the 10 minutes, the glyph ceases to glow and the trap is disabled.

**Success.** The glyph is damaged. Another Success counts as a Critical Success.

**Success or Critical Success.** The trap is disabled.

Water-Filled Room Trap

2nd tier (elite constructed trap)

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP); **DC** 17/15

*High on each wall is an inanimate gargoyle head with a gaping mouth. The cracks in the walls are green with algae.*

If the door to the room closes, it automatically locks. When it does so, water begins gushing from the gargoyles’ mouths. Roll initiative. On initiative count 20 and 10, the water level in the room rises 1 foot.

Once the water is higher than a creature’s height, that creature must swim. After 3 minutes, the room completely fills with water and begins to drain at a rate of 2 feet per

round. When the room is completely drained, the door unlocks.

***Door.*** An Engineering or Investigation check, or an examination of the door, reveals that it is fortified with two metal bands, each of which has a separate lock. Experimentation reveals that the locks allow free entry into the room but not out. The door gently closes by itself if not held open. The door has AC 15, 27 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and a damage threshold of 15.

Depending on the dungeon’s floor plan, there may be other doors in the room, each of which is similarly locked and fortified.

***Gargoyles.*** An Investigation or Perception check, or an examination of the gargoyles, reveals that the gargoyles’ tongues are coated with algae. Their throats are spouts that lead into the walls.

***Spell Solve.*** *Knock* unlocks one of the door’s two locks. *Water breathing* and similar spells allow creatures to survive the flooded room.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a thieves' tools check to unlock one of the door’s two locks. This check is made with disadvantage if the lock is underwater. The lower lock is two feet high and the upper lock is four feet high.
* A creature can make a Strength check to plug a gargoyle’s spout with an object.
* A creature that casts a spell that deals cold damage can make a spellcasting ability check to plug a gargoyle’s spout with ice.

**Critical Failure.** A critical failure to pick a lock permanently raises the lock’s DC by one. A critical failure to jam a gargoyle’s spout causes the

spout to crack, raising the DC for that spout by one.

**Failure.** The attempt fails. **Success.** One of the door’s locks is picked, or one of the water spouts is jammed until the start of the

triggering creature’s next turn. When both of the door’s locks are unlocked, the door can be opened, pouring water into the nearby rooms and disabling the trap. While one vent is plugged, the water level doesn’t rise on initiative count 10.

While all four are plugged, the water doesn’t rise on initiative count 20 or 10.

**Critical Success.** The creature picks both the door’s locks or permanently jams one of the water spouts.

**Water-Filled Room Trap Variant: Water-Filled Dungeon Trap**

3rd tier (elite constructed trap)

**Challenge** 15 (26,000 XP); **DC** 20/16

This variant is best used on the bottom floor of a multi-level dungeon. This room’s doors aren’t waterproof and don’t lock: ignore all text about locks. When the water level rises, it rises for the entire dungeon instead of merely inside the room, starting at the bottom of the dungeon and rising until the entire dungeon is submerged. When placing this trap, make sure that escape is possible for adventurers—and decide what happens to dungeon denizens that can’t breathe water!

Wind Tunnel Trap

0th tier (constructed trap) **Challenge** 1 (200 XP); **DC** 13/13 *Wind roars down a passage.*

A creature or object that enters the passage for the first time on a turn or starts

its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or trigger a Failure. Movement against the direction of the wind requires a Strength check (see Possible Solutions).

Additionally, ranged weapon attacks can’t be made against the direction of the wind, open flames in the tunnel are extinguished, and fogs and gases are dispersed.

A wind tunnel trap can also be used underwater to represent a strong current.

***Wind.*** The wind is loud and can be heard for 100 feet.

***Spell Solve.*** A *gust of wind* cast against the direction of the wind reduces the number of feet the wind tunnel pushes creatures and objects by 15 feet. Teleportation allows the wind wall to be bypassed.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Strength check to move against the wind. This check is made with advantage if the creature can find handholds or otherwise secure itself as it goes. **Critical Failure.** If the target is an object, it is pushed 30 feet in the direction of the wind. If the target is a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 3 (1d6) cold damage, is pushed 30 feet in the direction of the wind, and is unable to move against the wind until the start of its next turn.

**Failure.** As a Critical Failure, but the creature doesn’t take cold damage. **Success.** The creature is not pushed and can move against the wind without making a Strength check until the end of its turn, spending 2 feet of movement for each foot of movement.

**Critical Success.** As a Critical Success, but the creature does not

need to spend additional movement to move against the wind.

**Wind Tunnel Trap Variant: Howling Wind Tunnel Trap**

**Challenge** 15 (13,000 XP); **DC** 20/16

On a Critical Failure, the creature takes 52 (15d6) cold damage instead of 3 (1d6) cold damage.

Yellow Mold Trap

2nd tier (constructed trap)

**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP); **DC** 16/14

*A yellow-gold skeleton slumps atop a mottled, yellow-gold throne.*

The skeleton and throne are covered with **yellow mold**. A creature that moves within 30 feet, or disturbs the skeleton or throne, triggers a Failure.

***Exploration.*** An Investigation or Survival check, or an examination of the skeleton or throne, reveals that both appear to be covered with a furry, yellow mold. A Perception check reveals a musty smell and tiny yellow spores floating in the air. A creature that makes an Arcana or Nature check identifies the substance as yellow mold.

An examination of the skeleton reveals that it clutches a mold-covered object. The object might be a minor treasure, like a crown worth 750 gp, or a Boon or Discovery.

***Spell Solve.*** Sunlight or fire damage destroys the yellow mold.

**Possible Solutions**

* A creature can make a Stealth check to move through the area without triggering a Failure.
* A creature can make a Sleight of Hand check to take the object held by the skeleton without triggering a Failure.

**Critical Failure.** As a Failure, but the triggering creature automatically fails the saving throw against the yellow mold.

**Failure.** The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against the effects of yellow mold.

**Success or Critical Success.** The yellow mold isn’t disturbed.

# Random Dungeon Delves

This section contains random dungeon generators, each of which lets you map and stock a complete dungeon of any size. Each generator is themed around a common type of dungeon locale: **bastion**, **cavern**, **laboratory, mine**, **ruin**, **sewer**, **temple**, and **tomb**.

**How to Generate a Map**

As Narrator, you can plan out the dungeon ahead of time or generate it on the fly and learn the emergent story at the same time as the adventurers.

Each dungeon type has a node size, and each node contains either a room or a passage. For instance, each area of a bastion is 50 by 50 feet. If you generate a straight passage, it is 50 feet long. If you generate a room that isn’t big enough to fill up the entire node, place it wherever you want in the node; the rest of the node is filled with solid stone, with passageways through the stone for each of its exits.

In order to make a coherent dungeon, you will need to overrule the dice at times:

* When you generate an area adjacent to an already-generated area, ignore what the generator says about exits in that direction. If you already know there’s an exit, there’s an exit; if you already know there isn’t an exit, there isn’t an exit.
* When you generate a room exit that would leave the bounds of the

dungeon, you can either ignore it or use it as a dungeon exit.

* If you generate a passage that connects to an existing one, the new passage has the same width as the old one.
* When you complete a dungeon level by placing a dead end or a room with no exits, leaving no remaining areas to explore, check whether you’ve already placed either a major encounter or stairs to another floor. If not, then place an encounter or stairs in this node.

# Bastion

8: **Wide passage**. Roll on Passage Contents and Exits. For passage width, roll 1d4:

From underground lairs to mighty castles, bastions are well-defended homes inhabited by creatures worried about attacks from the outside world. A bastion usually contains barracks, food preparation and storage areas, and a throne room or other command center.

**Tiers.** Tier 0 and 1 bastions are usually bandit lairs. Tier 2 and higher bastions are frequently the mighty castles of rulers and conquerors.

**Bastion Size.** Each 50-foot-square node of a bastion contains either a room or passage. A small bastion is about 150 feet square (a 3 × 3 grid of nodes); a medium one is 250 feet square (a 5 × 5 grid); and a large one is 350 feet square (a 7 × 7 grid). **Alert.** Bastions use escalation clock rules. Start with a pool of 3 dice. Each combat encounter causes one die to be removed from the pool and one additional creature to be added to each future combat encounter. The extra creature is of the encounter’s lowest-CR creature type.

**Creating a Bastion**

To generate a new map, roll on the Description table for the initial area and follow its instructions, and then do so again to see what’s past each exit, and so on. If you’re filling a premade map, roll on Inhabitants and Contents for each location.

**Bastion: Description**

1: **Narrow passage.** Roll on Passage Contents and Exits. For passage width, roll 1d6:

1–2 2 ½ ft.

3–6 5 ft.

2–7: **Passage.** 10 feet wide. Roll on Passage Contents and Exits.

# Cavern

Under the earth lie twisting passages, vast caverns, and underground rivers, all cloaked in endless darkness. The environment itself can be just as dangerous as its inhabitants.

This generator lets you map a cave system.

**Tiers.** Tier 0 and 1 adventurers measure themselves against natural caves and caverns. Tier 2 and 3 adventurers delve deeper, into Underland itself.

**Cavern Size.** Each 70-foot-square node of a cavern contains either a cavern or a section of passage. A small cavern system is about 210 feet square (a 3 × 3 grid of nodes); a medium temple is 350 feet square (a 5 × 5 grid); and a large one is 490 feet square (a 7 × 7 grid). Underland is a vast megadungeon in which a single cavern system can extend for miles.

**Treacherous Terrain.** Naturally occurring caves are often slippery and riddled with pits and stony outcroppings. Whenever a creature uses the Dash action, it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw at the end of its turn, falling prone on a failure.

**Cavern: Set Pieces**

Set piece encounters usually feature a treasure hoard.

**1–2 Hail the Conquering Villains.** A raiding party has captured the residents of a rival settlement. They mean to exile, sacrifice, or even pit the captives against each other in gladiatorial games—and they’ll do the same to meddling adventurers.

**Setting:** The chamber contains cages of prisoners. Releasing all the prisoners distracts the enemy combatants with the lowest CR, removing them from the battle. **3–4 Exile.** A powerful champion was exiled from its kind.

Level 11–16: **nalfeshnee trap**

Level 17–20: **hidden cannon trap 7** A cave-in behind the party seals off the cavern complex’s entrance. There are other exits from the complex, but they lead into miles of winding, deserted Underland tunnels. On each day of travel through these tunnels, the party’s navigator must make a Nature or Survival check to find their way. Three successes, or one critical success, allows the party to escape the maze.

**8** The way is blocked by a settlement of deep dwarves, shadow elves, grimlocks, troglodytes, mycelials, or other underground dwellers. There are too many to fight, although the adventurers might be able to defeat or elude patrols. The easiest way through the settlement is to negotiate safe passage with its leaders.

# Laboratory

Great war mage colleges, secluded wizard’s towers, and alchemists’ workrooms are all examples of laboratories. Laboratories are places of research and typically include unique magical and alchemical effects that can’t be found anywhere else. In addition to living spaces, a laboratory requires workrooms and libraries.

**Tiers.** While laboratory inhabitants often include students and apprentices, the masters of large laboratories are commonly tier 3 or 4.

**Laboratory Size.** Each 50-foot-square node of a laboratory contains either a room or a section of passage. A small laboratory is about 150 feet square (a 3 × 3 grid of nodes); a medium one is 250 feet square (a 5 × 5 grid); and a large one is 350 feet square (a 7 × 7 grid).

**Magic Auras.** Adventurers trained in Arcana have advantage when making Investigation or Perception checks to examine magical phenomena.

**Creating a Laboratory**

To generate a new map, roll on the Description table for the initial area and follow its instructions, and then do so again to see what’s past each exit, and so on. If you’re filling a premade map, roll on Inhabitants and Contents for each location.

**Laboratory: Description**

Roll 1d12 + 8 to generate the first area of the dungeon. Then roll 1d20 on this table to determine what’s beyond each exit, and so on.

# Mine

When metal and ore are abundant, mines are busy places, but once the supply of that material dwindles, they become eerie, crumbling labyrinths in the lightless depths of the world.

**Tiers.** Of all types of dungeons, mines are the most likely to descend deep into the earth; a single mine can encompass multiple tiers. Tier 4 mines are relatively rare, since few miners can sustain their labors among the dangers of the utter depths.

**Mine Size.** Each 50-foot-square node of a mine contains either a room or passage. A small mine is about 150 feet square (a 3 × 3 grid of nodes); a medium one is 250 feet square (a 5 × 5 grid); and a large one is 350 feet square (a 7 × 7 grid). Most mines are multilevel affairs.

**Hazardous Environment.** Mines can be dangerous places without a single hostile creature or trap present. Cave-ins, darkness, pockets of poisonous or explosive gas, heavy mining machinery, and yawning mine shafts can spell doom for the unwary. Those with training in Engineering or Nature have advantage on Perception or Investigation checks to spot mine hazards.

**Creating a Mine**

To generate a new map, roll on the Description table for the initial area and follow its instructions, and then do so again to see what’s past each exit, and so on. If you’re filling a premade map, roll on Inhabitants and Contents for each location.

10: **Wide passage**. Roll on Passage Contents and Exits. For passage width, roll 1d4:

1–2 15 ft.

3–4 20 ft.

11–16 **Small room.** Roll on Room and Chamber Contents and Exits. For room size, roll 1d4:

1 15 × 15 ft.

4. Security checkpoint where guards search workers for contraband such as ore or precious stones
5. Healthy vein of whatever the mine was built to extract. The area is well lit. Tools, piles of ore sorted by quality, and carts of mined-out dirt and stone fill the area

6. Section of the wall embedded with colorful crystals. DC 15 Perception check to notice one of the crystals looks unusually polished for one still in the earth. Pressing the crystal opens a secret door
7. Close examination (DC 15 Investigation or Perception check) of the wooden walls of this supported tunnel reveals a set of seams. The door opens freely away from the tunnel’s interior, and closes automatically on a spring
8. An extra button hidden on the underside of a mining machine’s control panel (DC 15 Investigation check to notice) raises a secret door [if cut, change next one to 8–12]

2. Unusually sociable earth elemental embedded in a stone wall. Is actively helpful so long as nobody tries to mine the wall it’s embedded in
3. Broken-down mining machine. Can be repaired with a DC 18 Engineering check or scrapped for 225 gp worth of parts
4. Local surveying party and security detail. Friendly toward other humanoids unless they have a specific reason not to be
5. Abandoned supply room. Contains 2d8 tins of dwarven rations, two pickaxes, an ascender/descender set, and four coils of hempen rope

10–11 Ore vein. If mined and smelted over several weeks, the vein produces 100 pounds of metal. The type of metal varies by dungeon level: 1–2 copper, 3–4 silver, 5–10 gold, 11–16 platinum, 17–20 mithril or adamantine

12 Vein of gems. 1d10 gems can be collected without mining. If mined for several weeks, the vein produces a maximum of 50 more gems. The type of gem varies by dungeon level: 1–4 10 gp gem such as quartz, 5–10 100 gp gem such as garnet, 11–16 1,000 gp gem such as sapphire, 17–20 5,000 gp gem such as ruby

# Ruin

A ruin is distinct from other dungeons in that it no longer serves a particular purpose. It may be inhabited piecemeal by different groups, but no one ruler or gang controls more than a fraction of it—and whole sections may be completely abandoned to mindless undead, dusty traps, and the merciless progress of time.

**Tiers.** Ruins can be any tier, with older and more remote ruins tending to house stronger monsters.

**Ruin Size.** Each 50-foot-square node of a ruin contains either a room or passage. A small ruin is about 150 feet square (a 3 × 3 grid of nodes); a medium one is 250 feet square (a 5 × 5 grid); and a large one is 350 feet square (a 7 × 7 grid).

**Marks of Decay.** Uninhabited sections of ruins are covered with layers of dust and grime. Survival checks made to follow or track creatures, or to search for signs of travel through an area, are made with advantage. Furthermore, efforts to break a ruin’s furniture or doors are made with advantage.

**Creating a Ruin**

To generate a new map, roll on the Description table for the initial area and follow its instructions, and then do so again to see what’s past each exit, and so on. If you’re filling a premade map, roll on Inhabitants and Contents for each location.

2. A pile of rubble where one wall has caved in. A muffled voice can be heard from under the rubble. Underneath the rubble is a mechanical bronze statue that endlessly recites poetry
3. A dressing room containing a shattered mirror and wardrobes filled with rotten finery. A single robe is in good shape and radiates illusion magic. While wearing

An object takes its true form once removed from the room. The effect can be dispelled as a 4th-level spell. DC 13 Perception check: a smell of rot

three-headed dog, or the gate to a

white-walled city—is split by a faint crack down the middle. Pushing on the fresco opens the secret door.

# Sewer

The typical sewers beneath fantasy cities are magnificent public works from a bygone age. A mishmash of deserted concourses, covered riverways, claustrophobic tunnels, and buried ruins, they are a royal road for thieves, monsters, and adventurers alike.

While sewers were not designed with habitation in mind, they usually contain lairs, hideouts, and secret entrances to important places.

**Tiers.** Sewers are rarely tier 3 or 4. Below the sewers, deeper and more dangerous areas are usually ruins, tombs, or other locations.

**Sewer Size.** Each 100-foot-square node of a sewer contains passages. Some of these passage nodes also contain a room or chamber at an intersection or dead end. A sewer typically spans the oldest or richest parts of a city and can cover as much as a square mile.

**Disease.** Sewers are filthy. A humanoid that takes damage while in a sewer is exposed to disease. At the end of its next long rest, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be infected with sewer plague.

The predators can choose to fail or automatically succeed on this saving throw.

7–8 Tide-driven stone gates close behind the adventurers, forcing them to escape via a 100-foot underwater swim through fetid water. At the start of each of its turns, each

creature in the water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + half dungeon level) or become poisoned and unable to hold its breath. At the end of the swim, a metal grate (DC 10 + half dungeon level Strength check to break) blocks the exit.

9–10 A sluice gate opens, creating a waterfall that sweeps the adventurers to a new area or out of the sewer. Each creature must make three Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throws (their choice), taking 2 (1d4) damage per dungeon level per failure.

**Temple Size.** Each 50-foot-square node of a temple contains either a room or passage. A small temple is about 150 feet square (a 3

× 3 grid of nodes); a medium one is 250 feet square (a 5 × 5 grid); and a large one is 350 feet square (a 7 × 7 grid).

# Tomb

Catacombs, barrows, and graveyards are frequently the realms of the undead—although living necromancers and sinister priests may also frequent them.

Unlike most other types of dungeon, a tomb has little need for bedrooms, kitchens, and the other requirements of the living.

**Tiers.** Tombs are common adventuring locations at any tier. While low-level tombs feature skeletons and ghouls, others are home to mighty vampires, dread knights, and dragon liches.

**Tomb Size.** Each 50-foot-square node of a tomb contains either a room or passage. A small tomb is about 150 feet square (a 3 × 3 grid of nodes); a medium one is 250 feet square (a 5 × 5 grid); and a large one is 350 feet square (a 7 × 7 grid).

**Unholy.** The influence of the gods can’t reach easily into areas overrun with undead creatures. In some tombs, checks made to turn undead are made with disadvantage.

**Creating a Tomb**

To generate a new map, roll on the Description table for the initial area and follow its instructions, and then do so again to see what’s past each exit, and so on. If you’re filling a premade map, roll on Inhabitants and Contents for each location.

**Tomb: Description**

1: **Narrow passage.** Roll on Passage Contents and Exits. For passage width, roll 1d6:

1 15 ft.

2–3 20 ft.

9–14 **Small room.** Roll on Room and Chamber Contents and Exits. For room size, roll 1d4:

1 15 × 15 ft.

2 15 × 20 ft.

3 20 × 20 ft.

4 20 × 30 ft.

15–20 **Large chamber.** Roll on Room and Chamber Contents and Exits. For chamber size, roll 1d6:

1 30 × 30 ft.

2 30 × 40 ft.

3–4 40 × 40 ft.

**Tomb: Exits**

Don’t roll on this table if the room’s exits have already been determined by Obstacles, Set Pieces, etc.

If the die roll is odd, a room’s exits are blocked by doors. Otherwise, they are open.

3. An empty sarcophagus. The carving on the lid magically transforms to depict the most recent person to enter the room
4. Giant hourglasses rise to the ceiling like pillars. Some are nearly full and some have nearly run out. Each is labeled with a well-known name. If an hourglass is broken, that person instantly dies
5. An enormous statue of a skeletal reaper, so big its hunched shoulders brush the ceiling. The statue's eyes glow blue. The life energy of any creature that dies on this

dungeon level flows visibly into the statue. The creature can't be raised as undead or resurrected by any means short of *true resurrection* until the statue is destroyed

# Narrator Options

## Ability Scores in the Dungeon

To use the following rules, assign every dungeon a level from 1 to 20. If you’re unsure of the DC of an ability or skill check within the dungeon, you can set it to 10 + half the dungeon’s level.

These increasing DCs should be used only to represent the strength of the dungeon’s most potent defenses.

Performing routine tasks like climbing a rope or jumping across a 5-foot gap doesn’t become harder on deeper levels of the dungeon! The characters are competent adventurers who can complete such tasks without needing to make a check.

Similarly, if failure on an ability or skill check would halt progress through the adventure or otherwise result in a boring outcome, don’t call for a check! Checks are required only when success and failure both lead to interesting results.

#### Retrying Tasks

Some obstacles in a dungeon might require several attempts to overcome: picking a lock, lifting a gate, or toppling a statue are all tasks that can logically be retried.

If a character has any chance of succeeding at a task (i.e. they would succeed on the check if they rolled a 20) and they can make repeated attempts without consequence, then they don’t need to make a check.

Instead, they succeed automatically. Retrying is only interesting when there are consequences for failure. For instance, a

character at the bottom of a slippery slope is sure to climb up, given time, and normally no roll would be required. However, in the midst of combat, the character might need to make an Athletics check to see if they can climb up and join the fray.

Even outside of combat, failure at a task can be dramatic and interesting.

Consider increasing the stakes when a character retries a task. Let the players know the potential dangers of making a second attempt and ask if they still want to proceed. Here are some consequences you might impose on characters retrying a task:

* Trying the check again is likely to attract notice from hostile creatures or increase in the dungeon’s alert level.
* Trying again will take ten times longer than last time—and the next time, ten times longer than that.
* The characters must expend a resource to attempt the check again. They might need to cast a relevant spell (such as *bless* or *enhance ability*), spend exertion, or gain a level of exhaustion.
* A critically failed check made to manipulate an object (like opening a door or using a device) might damage the object so much that further checks become impossible.

#### Using Abilities and Skills

Dungeons are closed, architectural environments that present specific sets of obstacles. This section provides guidance for setting the DCs of common dungeon challenges.

#### Strength

Breaking Doors

When stymied by a locked door, iron gate, or even a blank stone wall, adventurers often resort to the most straightforward solution: breaking down the obstacle.

When time is of the essence, a character can make a Strength check to bash open a door, lift a portcullis, or otherwise force their way past a physical obstacle. When a single shoulder bash or a kick can’t open a door, but time is still of the essence, a character might try to destroy the door with an axe, hammer, or similar weapon. Most doors in the dungeon are designed to withstand such punishment.

They’re an inch or more thick and typically have 27 (5d10) hit points or more. The DC to bash down a door, or the AC to damage it, are as follows:

**TABLE: DOOR TOUGHNESS**

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DOOR TYPE** | **BASH DC** | **AC** | **RECOMMENDED DUNGEON LEVEL** |
| Wooden | 15 | 15 | 1+ |
| Stone | 17 | 17 | 5+ |
| Iron | 19 | 19 | 9+ |
| Mithral | 21 | 21 | 13+ |
| Adamantin e | 23 | 23 | 17+ |

Some dungeon doors are especially thick, protected by magical wards, or reinforced with iron bars. These fortified doors have damage thresholds equal to their AC values. Thus, an attack that would deal less than 15 damage has no effect on a fortified

wooden door. The DC to force open a fortified door is increased by 4 (so a fortified adamantine door can be bashed open with a Strength check of 27).

Given enough time, characters can dismantle most doors—unless even rolling a 20 on a Strength check can’t bash it open and even a critical hit can’t overcome its damage threshold.

Tunneling

In dire circumstances, characters might try to dig a tunnel or break through a wall.

Without a burrowing speed or magical assistance, a humanoid with the appropriate digging or tunneling tools can dig for up to 8 hours in a day. Over 8 hours, the creature can excavate a number of cubic feet of dirt equal to 10 + their Strength modifier. A creature can dig for additional hours using the Forced March rules, excavating an additional cubic foot per hour. Tunneling speed is halved if the digger needs to shore up walls to prevent collapse.

Soft stone, like the limestone walls of many caverns, can be excavated at

one-quarter the speed of earth and doesn’t require shoring up.

A wall made of hard stone, like granite, simply can’t be broken in a short time frame without specialized equipment, immense strength, or magical assistance.

Lifting and Carrying

While exploring dungeons, adventurers frequently have to pick up, push, and pull objects. The Narrator is responsible for estimating the weight of furniture, portcullises, statues, and other objects in the dungeon.

Often we know an object’s approximate size but need to determine its weight. Here are some very rough guidelines to help you approximate the weight of objects made of various materials. (Don’t worry about precision. The game won’t grind to a halt if you underestimate a statue’s weight by 25 percent!)

**TABLE: EXAMPLE WEIGHTS**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **A CUBIC FOOT OF…** | **WEIGHS…** |
| Wood | 45 |
| Water (creatures, parchment, books) | 60 |
| Dirt | 90 |
| Stone | 180 |
| Most metal | 500 |
| Gold and platinum | 1,200 |

Without requiring a Strength check, most characters can drag or lift a weight in pounds up to 30 times their Strength score. However, a character can push themselves beyond their limits for brief moments of supreme effort. A character can make a Strength check to drag a heavier object 5 feet or lift it above their head for one round. The DC of the check is the object’s weight in pounds divided by 40.

Once a character has made this check, they must finish a short or long rest before they can do so again or they suffer a level of exhaustion.

#### Dexterity

Contortion

A humanoid or humanoid-shaped creature can use its entire movement to move up to

1. feet through a gap or tunnel into which it’s too small to squeeze. While contorting in this way, a creature can’t make attacks, attacks against it are made with advantage, and it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. Even while carrying gear and wearing armor, a creature can enter a space listed on the chart below.

**TABLE: CONTORTION**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **SIZE** | **MINIMUM SPACE** |
| Tiny | 6 inches (or half the creature’s height, whichever is smaller) |
| Small | 12 inches |
| Medium | 18 inches |
| Large | 3 feet |
| Huge | 5 feet |
| Gargantuan and larger | 10 feet and larger |

A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Acrobatics check can enter a space half this wide. This check automatically fails if the creature is wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a bulky object. The Narrator can decide that a certain space is more or less awkward to enter and requires a higher or lower DC.

A non-humanoid creature’s shape determines the space it can enter. For example, a Gargantuan snake might be able to contort into a space that a Large humanoid could enter.

#### Intelligence

Mapping and Navigation in the Dungeon

A creature with writing supplies can make an accurate map of the dungeon as they traverse it. More challenging cartographic feats, such as creating a map that’s accurate down to the inch or making a map from memory, requires an Intelligence check. If a creature proficient with cartographers’ tools has such tools available, they add their proficiency bonus to the check. The DC to create a map is DC 10, or DC 15 for multi-level or otherwise complex maps. On a success, the creature creates an accurate map. On a failure, the map contains some inaccuracy the creator isn’t aware of.

A creature can make an Intelligence check to retrace their steps along a route in the dungeon. The DC for this check is DC 10, or DC 15 for a complex route or one they haven’t traveled in the last 24 hours.

The check automatically succeeds if the creature has an accurate map, and is made with disadvantage if the creature has an inaccurate map.

#### Wisdom

Hearing

A creature makes a Perception check to listen for noises, or uses its passive Perception to hear sounds it’s not actively listening for. Use the tables below to determine the DC to hear specific noises.

**TABLE: DC OF NOISES**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **NOISES** | **DC** |
| Stealthy activity | DC of Stealth check |
| Quiet noises (sitting, sleeping, reading) | 10 |
| Moderate noises (walking, conversation) | 5 |

#### Charisma

Communicating Without Language

Dungeons are often inhabited by creatures who live in close proximity but don't share a language. A creature can use sounds, gestures, and drawings to communicate with another intelligent creature, even if they don’t share a language. A creature can communicate a simple idea with a DC 10 Charisma check, and a complex one with a DC 15 check. If a creature makes a particularly clear gesture or drawing, this check may be made with advantage or might automatically succeed.

If the Charisma check fails, the message is misunderstood. Making the check during combat requires an action and might be made with disadvantage.

Example simple ideas:

* We mean you no harm!
* I’m hungry!
* My name is…
* Surrender!

Example complex ideas:

* What creatures live nearby?
* Did someone else pass through this room recently?
* Where can we find the treasure we seek?

Whether it is fired or thrown, nonmagical fires within 10 feet of the stone’s point of impact are immediately

extinguished, as are any magical lights or fires created with a spell slot of 2nd-level or lower.

If you place a door, a key that you can use to lock and unlock the door magically appears in your hand. Behind the door is a permanent passage through the wall. The passage is 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and up to 10 feet deep. The passage creates no instability.

If you place a trap, you can choose between the following traps: **acid pit trap**, **commanding voice trap**, **explosive runes trap**, **false door trap**, **hidden pit trap** (x3), **lock trap** (x3, can be placed only on a lock).

If you place a monster, the monster is not initially hostile to any creature present when it is summoned but is hostile to all other creatures. It otherwise acts according to its nature. The following monsters can be placed: **black pudding**, **gelatinous cube**, **hell hound**, **kobold** (x3), **minotaur**, **skeleton immortal** (x3).

**Gong of Alarm**

**Hunter’s Quiver**

**Idol of Light**

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 40,000 gp)* **Crafting components:** Sand from a celestial shore

This glass idol resembles a humanoid woman with a set of iridescent butterfly wings and a crystalline crown. The idol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet at all times. It has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges each day if exposed to the light of dawn. You can expend the idol’s charges to produce the following effects:

* When you take radiant or necrotic damage, you can use your reaction

to expend 1 charge and gain resistance to that damage type for the next minute or until you use this property again.

* As an action, you can expend 2 charges to make the idol shed light, as if by the *daylight* spell, for 10 minutes.
* As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast *dispel magic*, targeting an illusion or necromancy spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
* As a bonus action, you can expend 4 charges to cause the idol to flare with blinding light. Creatures you choose within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. Undead make the save with disadvantage.

**Midir’s Trident**

*Weapon (trident), very rare (requires attunement; cost 20,000 gp)* **Crafting components:** Unique (uncraftable)

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic trident. When you hit with this weapon, you deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage. When you make a ranged attack with this trident, it has a normal range of 40 feet and a maximum range of 120 feet, and it returns to your hand after the attack.

The trident’s size changes to match your own. If you are Large or larger, it deals an extra 2d6 lightning damage.

**Poison Breath Bottle**

*Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 75 gp)* **Crafting components:** Green dragon breath

You can use an action to throw this green vial at a point within 20 feet. The vial shatters on impact and creates a

5-foot-radius cloud of poison gas. A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn. The area inside the cloud is lightly obscured. The cloud remains for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

**Prospector’s Pick**

*Weapon (war pick), very rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)*

**Crafting components:** iron from Plane of Earth

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic war pick. Attacks with this weapon deal an extra 3d6 piercing damage to objects and creatures made of earth or stone.

The pick has 8 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to magically disintegrate a 5-foot cube of nonmagical earth or unworked stone within 5 feet of you. Precious gems, metal ores, and objects not made of earth or stone are left behind. The pick regains 1d8 charges at dawn.

**Rod of Entropy**

*Rod, very rare (requires attunement; cost 15,000 gp)*

**Crafting components:** Demilich’s skull This skull-topped rod can be used as a club that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.

Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage per charge expended, or half the damage on a success. A creature killed by this damage decays and becomes an inanimate skeleton. In addition, nonmagical objects in the area that are not being carried or worn experience rapid aging. If you expended 1 charge, soft materials like leather and cloth rot away, and liquid evaporates. If you expended 2 charges, hard organic materials like wood and bone crumble, and iron and steel rust away. Expending 3 charges causes Medium or smaller stone objects to crumble to dust.

**Reloader Gremlin**

*Wondrous item (gear gremlin), uncommon (cost 250 gp)*

**Crafting components:** Bear trap broken by a trapped creature

A tiny, ethereal gremlin squats motionless in this silver picture frame, which from a distance appears to contain a painting of the gremlin. The gremlin watches a particular device or mechanism. One minute after the device is triggered, the gremlin emerges from its frame, performs whatever actions are necessary to reset the device, and returns to its frame.

The gremlin is ethereal and unable to interact with objects and creatures on the Material Plane other than its frame and the device it watches.

**Staff of Squalor**

*Staff, rare (requires attunement; cost 2,500 gp)*

**Crafting components:** Mushrooms or mold with disease-curing properties

Strands of white mycelium cover the head of this gnarled wooden staff. When tapped on the ground, the staff sheds a thin coating of dirt. While attuned to the staff, you suffer

no harmful effects from diseases but can still carry diseases and spread them to others. When you hit a creature with this staff, you can force the target to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it contracts one disease of your choice that you’re currently carrying.

**Sword of the Serpent**

*Weapon (shortsword), very rare (requires attunement; cost 45,000 gp)*

**Crafting components:** Unique (uncraftable)

**Verdant Fang**

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 400 gp)*

**Crafting components:** Fang from a green dragon

You can attune to this item only if you’re in the good graces of the green dragon who granted it to you. You attune to the fang by pressing it into your mouth, whereupon it replaces one of your canine teeth. While attuned to the fang, you can speak and understand Draconic, and you can use an action to breathe a 15-foot cone of poison gas. Creatures in the area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 poison damage on a failed save or half the damage on a success. You can’t use this property again until you finish a long rest.

As an action, you can bite down on the fang, destroying it. Doing so sends a mental distress signal to the dragon who granted you the fang; the dragon immediately learns where you are and will come to your aid.

**Senses** blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 15

**Languages** Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.

***Amphibious.*** The aboleth can breathe air and water.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The aboleth attacks once with its bite and twice with its tentacles.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the aboleth can’t bite a different creature.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it contracts a disease called the Sea Change. On a success, it is immune to this disease for 24 hours. While affected by this disease, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom

saving throws. After 1 hour, the target grows gills, it can breathe water, its skin becomes slimy, and it begins to suffocate if it goes 12 hours without being immersed in water for at least 1 hour. This disease can be removed with a disease-removing spell cast with at least a 4th-level spell slot, and it ends 24 hours after the aboleth dies.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Ink Jet (Recharge 5–6).*** While underwater, the aboleth exudes a cloud of inky slime in a 30-foot-radius sphere. The slime extends around corners, and the area is heavily obscured for 1 minute or until a strong current dissipates the cloud. The aboleth then moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Combat** The aboleth bites and grapples its strongest enemy. It uses its tentacles on other foes in the area or on a grappled creature if no other enemies are within reach. If bloodied, it uses Ink Jet to escape.

ABOLETH BRUTE VARIANT: ABOLETH FALLEN ASCENDANT

The result of the aboleths’ most successful attempts to confront the gods directly, fallen ascendants briefly achieved minor divine status, only to subsequently lose it.

Bolstered by some lingering vestige of their short-lived divine power, they are among the most powerful of their kind.

The aboleth is CR 14 (11,500 XP). It has the following trait:

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The aboleth’s spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells as bonus actions, requiring no components: At will: *bane*, *chill touch*

3/day each: *detect thoughts* (range 120 ft.), *eyebite*, *project image* (range 1 mile), *phantasmal force*

The aboleth has the following additional bonus actions:

***Bane (1st-Level; Concentration).*** Three creatures within 30 feet that the aboleth can see must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target subtracts a d4 from attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute.

***Chill Touch (Cantrip).*** A spectral tentacle flails at a creature within 120 feet. The aboleth makes a ranged spell attack with a +10 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 13 (3d8) necrotic damage and can’t regain hit points until the start of its next turn.

***Eyebite (6th-Level; Concentration).*** The aboleth’s eyes become an inky void.

One creature within 60 feet that the aboleth can see and that can see it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted by one of the following effects for the duration. Until the spell ends, on each of the aboleth’s turns it can use a bonus action to target a creature that has not already succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of *eyebite*. The spell ends after 1 minute.

*Asleep:* The target falls unconscious, waking if it takes any damage or another creature uses an action to rouse it.

*Panicked:* The target is frightened. On each of its turns, the frightened creature uses its action to take the Dash action and move away from the aboleth by the safest and shortest available route unless there is nowhere for it to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away where it can no longer see the aboleth, this effect ends.

*Sickened:* The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending this effect on a successful save.

**ABOLETH CHAMPION** CHALLENGE 7

***Abolethic Agent.*** The aboleth champion is treated as an aboleth for the purposes of an aboleth thrall’s Self-Sacrifice reaction.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The champion makes two melee attacks.

***Serrated Sword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or construct, it makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it receives a wound. While wounded, it takes 4 (1d8) ongoing slashing damage and is rattled.

Further wounds on a wounded creature have no effect. A creature can use an action to make a DC 12 Medicine check, ending the ongoing damage and rattled condition on a success. The effect also ends if the target receives at least 1 hit point of magical healing.

***Strangling Grasp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*

+7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6

+ 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a

Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). While grappled in this way, the target is restrained and can’t breathe, and the champion can’t use its strangling grasp on a different creature.

***Mental Blast.*** The champion emits a 15-foot cone of psychic energy. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed

save, the target takes 27 (5d10) psychic damage and is rattled until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn’t rattled.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Vicious Taunt.*** The champion magically mocks or threatens a rattled creature that can hear and understand it. The target makes a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

**Combat** The champion attacks with its serrated sword, inflicting wounds on as many foes as possible. It then uses Vicious Taunt and makes strangling grasp attacks against wounded creatures. If it can target two foes (or three foes and an ally), it uses Mental Blast. It retreats only to attack again later.

***Amphibious.*** The horror can breathe air and water.

***Horrifying Cacophony.*** A non-aberration that starts its turn within 20 feet of the horror and can hear it makes a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and is confused until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn’t confused. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the horror’s Horrifying Cacophony for 24 hours.

***Stinger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution save. On a failed save, the target is implanted with a larval seed. The target is confused until the end of its next turn and then takes 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and two levels of strife as a newly formed **gibbering mouther** rips from its body.

***Horrifying Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The draconic horror exhales a blast of psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each

non-aberration creature in the area must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 63 (18d6) psychic damage and gains a level of strife. On a success, the target takes half damage and doesn’t gain strife.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The horror can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Absorb Ally.*** The horror consumes a Large or smaller aberration within 5 feet of it, regaining 27 (6d8) hit points.

***Psionic Assault.*** The horror targets a creature within 120 feet with a blast of

psionic energy. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma save or be frightened until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is also paralyzed while frightened in this way.

***Whirlwind.*** The horror flaps its wings, creating a howling wind. Non-aberration creatures within 30 feet of the horror must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet directly away from the horror or pulled 10 feet closer (horror’s choice; same effect on all applicable creatures).

**Combat** The draconic horror leads with its Horrifying Breath but otherwise prefers to stay in the midst of its enemies, making maximum use of its horrific maws attack and Horrifying Cacophony and Warper of Reality traits. It reserves its stinger for low-AC, high-damage characters such as rogues or spellcasters, hoping to turn some of their damage output against their allies.

## Fungi

**Dream Powder**

An herbalist can refine the remains of a dreamer’s morel into a potent sleeping powder. Creating one dose of *dream powder* requires 8 hours of work and a DC 15 Intelligence or Wisdom check with an herbalism kit. As an action, a creature can throw the powder at a creature within 10 feet. Unless the target doesn’t need to breathe, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is unconscious.

###### REACTIONS

***Dream Spores (Recharge 6).*** If the dreamer’s morel is in an area of bright light, it expels a cloud of spores in a 10-foot radius. Breathing creatures in the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 2d4 hours. A creature poisoned in this way is also unconscious and experiences vivid, hallucinatory dreams. Unless the creature is cured of the poison before the condition ends, it must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw when it awakens. On a failure, it takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage.

**Combat** The morel uses Dream Spores if it is within an area of bright light and a creature is within 10 feet of it. It then attacks with its tendrils, prioritizing conscious creatures, and uses Eat Dreams on unconscious creatures.

DREAMER’S MOREL VARIANT: GIANT DREAMER’S MOREL

So long as it has psychic energy to consume, a dreamer’s morel can live indefinitely, growing ever larger.

**Languages** understands the languages of its creator but can’t speak

***Immutable Form.*** The guardian is immune to any effect that would alter its form.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** When the guardian fails a saving throw while it has at least two heads active, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, one of its heads becomes inactive until the end of its next turn.

***Multiple Heads.*** While the guardian has more than one head active, it has advantage on Perception checks and on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and it can’t be flanked.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The guardian makes three bite attacks, minus one for each of its inactive heads. Each bite must be against a different target.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) piercing damage.

***Poison Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The guardian can take 3 legendary actions, minus one for each inactive head, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Bronze Clangor (1/Round).*** The guardian’s tongue tolls in its bronze mouth like a bell. Each creature within 60 feet that can hear the clangor makes a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 21 (6d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn’t deafened. The guardian can’t use this legendary action if its bronze head is disabled.

***Iron Breath (1/Round).*** The guardian breathes poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 24 (7d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn’t poisoned. The guardian can’t use this legendary action if its iron head is disabled.

***Stone Howl (1/Round).*** The guardian lets loose a spine-chilling howl. Each creature within 60 feet that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect on itself ends. On a

failure, the creature is petrified. The guardian can’t use this legendary action if its stone head is disabled.

***Tail.*** The guardian attacks with its poison tail.

**Combat** The guardian obeys its master’s instructions to the letter. In combat, it rushes into a group of enemies so that it can make as many bite attacks as possible. It can’t use the same head twice in the same round, so it usually starts with Stone Howl, then uses Iron Breath and finally Bronze Clangor. On later turns, it may attack with its tail instead of using Stone Howl if most of its opponents are deafened.

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** —

***Draining Aura.*** When a living creature starts its turn within 20 feet of the rust monster or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) force damage as its blood is sucked

from its pores by the rust monster’s feathery antennae. The creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the force damage taken, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its next turn. The reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or is targeted by a *greater restoration* spell. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Metal Detection.*** The rust monster can smell metal within 60 feet.

***Rust Metal.*** A weapon made of metal that hits the rust monster corrodes after dealing damage, taking a permanent –1 penalty to damage rolls per hit. If this penalty reaches –5, the weapon is destroyed. A creature can spend 1 minute polishing or repairing a magic weapon, removing this penalty. Metal ammunition is destroyed after dealing damage.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The rust monster attacks once with its antennae and twice with its bite.

***Antennae.*** The rust monster uses its antennae to corrode a metal object within 20 feet. It can destroy up to a

1-foot-square portion of an unattended object. If the object is worn or carried, the object’s owner makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, avoiding the rust monster’s antennae on

a success.

Metal shields or armor the rust monster touches with its antennae corrode, taking a permanent –1 penalty to its AC protection per hit. If the penalty reduces the armor’s AC protection to 10, the armor is destroyed. A creature can spend 1 minute polishing or repairing magic armor, removing this penalty. If the rust monster touches a metal weapon, the weapon is subject to Rust Metal.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16).

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the rust monster can’t bite another target.

**Combat** The rust monster attacks the creature carrying the most metal; once all metal is gone, it targets the closest creature. It flees if it is bloodied and it detects no iron or steel items within 60 feet.

***Amorphous.*** The symbiote can pass through an opening as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in sunlight, the symbiote has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The symbiote attacks with its shadow tendril and uses Assimilate.

***Shadow Tendril.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, and the symbiote attaches to the target. A creature can use an action to make a DC 9 Strength check, detaching the symbiote on a success. The symbiote can detach itself as a bonus action.

***Assimilate.*** The symbiote targets a humanoid it’s attached to, a willing humanoid within 5 feet, or a humanoid corpse within 5 feet. The symbiote attempts to assimilate the target. An unwilling creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to resist. A creature warded by *protection from evil and good* automatically succeeds on this save. If the target is a corpse, it becomes an undead creature under the symbiote’s control, regaining all its hit points. The undead creature is destroyed when the symbiote leaves it.

While assimilated, the symbiote has full cover from all effects and is immune to all damage, except that it takes any radiant damage taken by its host. It can’t make shadow tendril attacks or use Assimilate or Snuff Light. The target gains the **shadow symbiote thrall** template and is charmed by the symbiote.

The symbiote can use an action to leave the host. It is forced out if the host is reduced to 0 hit points or if the host is the target of a *protection from evil and good* spell.

When the symbiote leaves, it appears within 5 feet of the host.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Snuff Light.*** The symbiote magically extinguishes nonmagical light sources within 30 feet.

**Combat** While the shadow symbiote has a creature assimilated, it encourages the creature to fight in the symbiote’s defense until the creature dies. It then continues to battle, trying to assimilate a new target, until it is bloodied. It then flees using its climb speed.

##### Shadow Symbiote Thrall Template

Any living or dead humanoid can become a shadow symbiote thrall. Its challenge rating increases by 2. A creature retains all its statistics except as noted below.

***Type.*** If the thrall is a dead humanoid, its type becomes undead.

***Damage Resistances.*** The thrall gains resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage and damage from nonmagical weapons.

***Damage Immunities.*** The thrall gains immunity to necrotic and poison damage.

***Blindsight.*** The thrall gains blindsight out to a range of 120 feet.

***Heart of Darkness.*** Creatures within 30 feet of the thrall have the range of their darkvision reduced by 60 feet, to a minimum of 0.

***Telepathy.*** The thrall gains telepathy out to a range of 30 feet.

If the thrall’s character level or challenge rating is 2 or higher, it can take the following additional bonus actions:

***Shadow Tendril.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and any light source the target wears or carries is suppressed until the end of the thrall’s next turn.

***Snuff Light.*** The thrall magically extinguishes nonmagical light sources within 30 feet.

***Reanimation.*** When the immortal is reduced to 0 hit points, it is not destroyed but falls prone and is paralyzed until the

end of its next turn. While paralyzed, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate skeleton. When this paralysis ends, the immortal regains all its hit points. If the immortal is reduced to 0 hit points by an attack that deals bludgeoning or radiant damage, or if it is dealt bludgeoning or radiant damage while at 0 hit points, it is permanently destroyed.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The immortal makes two scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

###### REACTIONS

***Disarm.*** When an adjacent creature the immortal can see misses the immortal with an attack made with a melee weapon, the immortal makes a Dexterity check. If this check is higher than the triggering attack roll, the attacker drops the weapon they used to make the attack. The weapon lands in a space of the skeleton’s choice within 5 feet of the attacker.

**Combat** The immortal fights with more intelligence than most skeletons. It attacks the creatures it perceives as most dangerous first, such as those that deal bludgeoning or radiant damage. It takes cover against ranged attacks if it can. If it fights multiple creatures, it saves its reaction to disarm a creature wielding a bludgeoning weapon. If one of its enemies is disarmed, the immortal picks up the weapon.

After it is restored by its Reanimation trait, the immortal leaps to its feet and attacks at the start of its next turn.

***Magic Resistance.*** The warlord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The warlord makes two greatsword attacks or two black lightning attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage. On a critical hit, the warlord can use Sound the Attack.

***Black Lighting.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.

***Sound the Attack.*** Each skeleton or skeletal horde of CR 7 or less within 30 feet can use its reaction to make an attack.

***Raise Bonespawn.*** The warlord touches up to three inanimate skeletons or piles of bones, animating them as bonespawn under the warlord’s control.

###### REACTIONS

***Arcane Punishment.*** When the warlord succeeds on a saving throw against a spell cast by a creature within 60 feet that the warlord can see, the warlord attacks the caster with black lightning.

***Riposte.*** When a creature the warlord can see misses the warlord with a melee

attack, the warlord makes a greatsword attack against that creature.

The following variants can be applied to any skeleton. If multiple variants are applied to the same skeleton, apply them in alphabetical order.

**Variant: Burning Skeleton**

Burning skeletons are formed from the charred remains of those burned alive on funeral pyres. Wreathed in magical flames, burning skeletons set their enemies ablaze with their flaming weapons and with fiery blasts from their eye sockets.

If a skeleton’s CR is less than 1, it increases to 1. If a skeleton’s CR is already 1 or higher, it increases by 1.

A burning skeleton is immune to fire damage and has the following additional traits:

***Burning Weapons.*** A creature hit by the skeleton’s melee or ranged attacks takes ongoing fire damage equal to the skeleton’s proficiency bonus. The creature can use an action to extinguish the flames, ending the ongoing damage.

***Death Burst.*** When the skeleton is destroyed, it explodes. Each creature within 5 feet makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.

**Variant: Four-Armed Skeleton**

With the ability to rearrange limbs as they like, it’s no surprise that necromancers hit upon a simple way to increase their skeletons’ deadliness: add more arms.

Four-armed skeletons weave their weapons in glittering offensive and defensive displays that can overwhelm lone opponents.

A four-armed skeleton is an elite monster, equivalent to two skeletons of the

base type. For instance, a four-armed skeletal immortal is equivalent to two CR 1 monsters (400 XP). Its hit points are doubled. It has the following additional traits, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Elite Recovery.*** At the end of each of its turns while bloodied, the skeleton ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can do so as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.

***Four Arms.*** As a bonus action on each of its turns, the skeleton can make an attack or take the Multiattack action.

***Reactive Arms.*** The skeleton can take two reactions each round, but not more than one per turn.

**Variant: Winged Skeleton**

With giant bat wings grafted to their shoulder blades, winged skeletons look like nightmare soldiers in hellish armies. While they are not fiends, they often serve as scouts for evil masters.

If a skeleton’s CR is less than 1, it is doubled. If a skeleton’s CR is already 1 or higher, its challenge rating does not change.

A winged skeleton has a fly speed of

60.

## Stone Shark

**STONE SHARK** CHALLENGE 4

*Large monstrosity* 1,100 XP

**AC** 13 (natural armor)

**HP** 85 (9d10 + 36; bloodied 42)

**Speed** 0 ft., burrow 40 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover) **STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA** 18 (+4)12 (+1)18 (+4)2 (–4) 10 (+0)4 (–3)

**Proficiency** +2; **Maneuver DC** 14

**Senses** tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 10

**Languages** —

***Stone Glide.*** The shark can burrow through nonmagical stone. While doing so, it doesn't disturb the material it moves through. The shark can’t be harmed by stone weapons or projectiles, as such weapons pass right through them.

###### ACTIONS

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14).

While grappled in this way, the target gains the stone shark’s Stone Glide trait, and the stone shark can’t bite a different creature. If the target escapes the grapple while it is inside stone, it takes 27 (5d10) force damage and is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space outside the stone.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

###### REACTIONS

***Tail Swat.*** When a creature the stone shark can see hits it with a melee attack, the shark attacks that creature with its tail.

**Combat** The shark begins its turn hiding inside stone. It flies from its hiding place, tries to grapple a creature with its bite, and if successful retreats into stone. It replies to opportunity attacks with its tail swat. It retreats when it can swim away with a fresh kill. It may also retreat if it is bloodied, but not if any of its enemies are also bloodied. A bloodied stone shark may follow potential prey for some time and launch a surprise attack when they are distracted.

## Titans

**MIDIR** CHALLENGE 24

*Legendary Gargantuan celestial (titan)*

62,000 XP

**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 22

**Languages** Celestial, Common, telepathy 60 ft.

***Divine Grace.*** If Midir makes a saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, he takes no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

Furthermore, while wearing medium armor, Midir adds his full Dexterity bonus to his Armor Class (already included).

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Midir’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 25). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *arcane mirror* (chapter 1), *charm monster*, *command*, *creation*

3/day: *heroes’ feast*, *hold monster*, *teleportation circle* (both sides are the surface of a mirror known to Midir instead of a magic circle; Midir can’t pass through), *shatter* (6th level)

***Magic Resistance.*** Midir has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mirror Prohibition.*** Midir can’t willingly break a mirror.

***Regeneration.*** Midir regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn as long as he has at least 1 hit point.

###### ACTIONS

***Midir’s Trident.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +20 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 40/120, one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d6 + 13) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) lightning damage. If used to make a ranged attack, the trident then reappears in Midir’s hand.

***Hold Monster (5th-Level; V, S, Concentration).*** One creature Midir can see within 60 feet makes a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Shatter (6th-Level; V, S).*** An ear-splitting ringing sound fills a 10-foot-radius sphere emanating from a point Midir can see within 60 feet. Creatures in the area make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) thunder damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature made of stone, metal, or other inorganic material has disadvantage on its saving throw. Unattended objects in the area also take the damage.

###### BONUS ACTIONS

***Immortal Form.*** Midir magically changes his size between Gargantuan and Medium. While Medium, he has disadvantage on Strength checks. His statistics are otherwise unchanged.

***Teleport.*** Midir magically teleports to an unoccupied space within 120 feet that he can see (either directly or reflected in a mirror).

###### REACTIONS

***Split Self (1/Round).*** When Midir takes damage, he splits himself into two identical bodies in the same space. Each body has half the hit points of the original, rounded down, and they share their daily spells in common. On Midir's turn, each body can take a full turn, in any order Midir chooses. Each body has its own reaction, and each can take 1 legendary each round. The bodies can share a space. Midir can’t have more than three bodies at a time.

As a bonus action, two Midirs in the same space can merge their bodies. The new body has the total hit points of both and is only affected by conditions or effects that affected both.

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

Midir can take 1 legendary action, choosing from the options below. He regains the spent legendary action at the start of his turn.

***Attack.*** Midir makes a weapon attack.

***Cast Spell.*** Midir casts a spell. He can’t use this option if he has cast a spell since the start of his last turn.

***Teleport.*** Midir uses Teleport.

**Combat** Midir uses Split Self whenever possible; on Midir’s turn, each duplicate moves to make it more difficult to include multiple duplicates in an area spell. Each Midir uses their trident for most attacks, reserving Shatter for groups of two or more foes. If Midir is bloodied and has no duplicates, he offers to make a deal. If his offer is rejected, Midir fights to the death.

**VARIANT: Midir the Reborn**

If Midir is released from his dungeon prison and reclaims his throne, he draws upon the divine power he enjoyed in ancient times and becomes Midir the Reborn.

Midir the Reborn is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 24 monsters (124,000 XP). He has 738 (36d20

+ 360; bloodied 369) hit points and the following additional bonus action, which he can use only while bloodied.

***Summon Aleas.*** Midir summons an **aleas** from an unbroken mirror within 60 feet. The aleas appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mirror. Midir chooses the creature that the aleas doubles, which must be a creature Midir can see and which can't be a creature that currently has an aleas double. Midir can’t summon more than one aleas per round, even if there are multiple Midirs.

An aleas has a challenge rating equal to one-half the character level or challenge rating of the creature it imitates (rounding up).

**ALEAS** CHALLENGE VARIABLE

**Damage Resistances** as its double **Damage Immunities** as its double **Condition Immunities** as its double **Senses** as its double

**Languages** as its double

***Double.*** When the aleas is summoned, it takes on the current appearance of an individual humanoid creature of the summoner’s choice. Except for its type, the aleas shares all statistics of the

creature it duplicates, including traits, actions, abilities, known spells, and any resources spent (for instance, it gains the known spells and currently available spell slots of the original creature, but not expended spell slots). When summoned, it is not subject to any non-permanent effects or conditions affecting the doubled creature at the time. After it is summoned, changes to the doubled creature’s statistics have no effect on the aleas. The aleas acts immediately after the doubled creature in the initiative order.

When summoned, the aleas gains an exact copy of every object the double creature carries, except for powerful unique items such as artifacts. The doubled equipment disappears when the aleas is dispelled or when it has been out of the aleas’s possession for 1 minute.

The aleas is destroyed if it travels to a different plane, when it is reduced to 0 hit points, or when the doubled creature is reduced to 0 hit points.

***Double Sense.*** The aleas knows the distance and direction to the doubled creature at all times.

***Double Vulnerability.*** The aleas is vulnerable to damage dealt by its doubled creature.

***Double Weakness.*** When the aleas makes an attack or casts a spell that deals damage, creatures other than the doubled creature take only half the damage dealt.

###### ACTIONS

***Doubled Action.*** The aleas gains all the actions, reactions, and bonus actions available to its double.

**Combat** The aleas focuses on fighting its double. It ignores other combatants unless they’re in the way, although it makes no effort to avoid damaging its double’s allies. If its double makes an

attack or casts a damaging spell, the aleas does the same, if doing so allows them to target their double.

***Keen Smell.*** The troll has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell.

***Legendary Resistance (4).*** The troll has four extra troll, humanoid, or giant faces budding from its hide. When the troll fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. If it does, one of its extra faces dies. When the troll succeeds on a saving throw in this way, it takes no damage from an effect that would deal half damage on a success. Once the troll has used this trait four times, it can’t do so again until it consumes another creature that has a face.

***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn’t function on its next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

###### ACTIONS

***Multiattack.*** The troll attacks once with its bite and twice with its claw.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and the troll can’t bite a different creature. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies and the troll swallows the creature. If a swallowed creature isn’t retrieved from the troll’s stomach within 1 hour, its body is destroyed, its face appears on the troll’s hide, and the troll gains another use of Legendary Resistance.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (3d4 + 7) slashing damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone

###### LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The troll can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Clumsy Leap.*** The troll leaps up to 50 feet horizontally or 20 feet vertically, with or without a running start. The troll lands prone.

***Lunging Claw.*** The troll moves up to half its speed straight towards a target without provoking opportunity attacks and makes a claw attack against that target. For each 10 feet the troll moves as part of this action, the attack deals an additional 3 (1d6) slashing damage.

***Backhand Swipe (Costs 2 Actions).*** The troll makes a claw attack against one or two targets. A creature hit by this attack must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet and fall prone.

***Rock (Costs 2 Actions).*** The troll makes a rock attack.

**Combat** The troll bites and claws the closest creature. If it takes over 40 damage from a single attack, it uses its Clumsy Leap or Lunging Claw legendary actions to reach that attacker. Otherwise, it chomps a grappled creature or uses Backhand Swipe. It flees or offers to make peace only if it takes fire or acid damage while it has no uses of Legendary Resistance.

**VARIANT: Troll King**

A troll king holds court among lesser trolls, giants, and other fearsome hunters. Each of a troll king’s subjects is allowed to live only in exchange for a daily tribute of flesh. Some troll kings, their appetites sated by mighty subjects, consider themselves rivals to powerful humanoid rulers, genie nobles, and archfey.

The troll king is an elite monster, equivalent to two CR 15 monsters (26,000 XP). It has 500 (40d12 + 240) hit points. The troll has the following reaction:

***Budding Slash.*** When the troll takes slashing damage, it can expend one use of its Legendary Resistance. If it does so, one of the extra faces on its skin is severed and becomes a **troll** within 5 feet of the troll king. This troll is under the troll king’s control, acts on the troll king’s initiative, and bears an uncanny resemblance to the severed face. The troll king can use a bonus action to deal

1. (1d6) slashing damage to itself, triggering this reaction.

The troll has the following additional legendary action, which it can use only while bloodied:

***Elite Recovery.*** The troll ends one negative effect currently affecting it. It can use this action as long as it has at least 1 hit point, even while unconscious or incapacitated.
