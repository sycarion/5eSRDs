# Warmage

Warmages train for the battlefield, learning to fight alongside soldiers on the field of war. Mass-damage specialists, they are experts at area-of-effect damage, operating as magical artillery. Accustomed to such environments, warmages are vary capable of protecting themselves.

### Arcane Shield

When you choose this archetype at level 2, you gain the benefits of a persistent arcane shield. This magical protective aura grants you a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. The arcane shield only operates while you are awake and conscious.

At level 10, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at level 14 it increases to +3.

### Armored Wizard

Additionally at level 2, you gain proficiency in light and medium armor.

### Sculpt Battlefield

At level 6 you gain the ability to alter the very terrain of the battlefield. As a bonus action you can render a 30 foot diameter area within 100 feet difficult terrain for 10 minutes. If you have already created difficult terrain using this feature, that effect is ended when you create new additional terrain.

If you expend a 3rd-level or higher spell slot when you activate this feature, you may choose one of the following enhancements:

The area of your difficult terrain is 50 feet in diameter.

The area of your difficult terrain is a 100-foot line.

The area of your difficult terrain is a 50-foot cone.

A number of allies equal to your

proficiency bonus is unaffected by the difficult terrain.

### Siege Mage

Additionally at level 6, your spells deal double damage to inanimate objects such as walls, doors, and structures.

### Ironclad Wizard

Also at level 6, you gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Battlefield Blaster

At level 10, when you roll dice to determine the damage of a spell which does

area-of-effect damage (circle, cone, cube, cylinder, line, sphere, or square), your damage dice explode. This means that you can reroll any dice that have the maximum result and add them to the total. For example, if you cast a fireball and roll three 6s among your damage dice, you roll an additional 3d6, and continue to reroll any 6s adding them to the total damage dealt.

### Arcane Support

At level 14, you gain the ability to bolster your allies in battle. As a reaction you can do one of the following:

Grant a number of allies within 100

feet equal to twice your proficiency bonus the benefits of your Arcane Shield for up to 10 minutes. This effect requires concentration to maintain.

Enchant the weapons of a number of

allies equal to your proficiency bonus, giving them a +1 bonus to hit and damage, and changing their damage type to your choice of fire, cold, or lightning for up to 1 minute. This effect requires concentration to maintain.

Once you have used this feature you cannot do so again until after you have taken a short rest.

# Necromancer

Necromancy is the practice of death magic–dark magic which calls on the very power of unlife. Necromancers are reviled and feared wherever they go: students of death and masters of the undead, they are able to speak with the dead, create skeletal and zombie minions, and drain the very life force from their foes.

While many necromancers use their powers for good, the practices of commanding undead minions and talking to those who have passed usually evoke revulsion or animosity from those who witness them, often making social encounters uncomfortable. The use of necromantic magic is widely regarded as evil, and the practitioners of it similarly so.

### Touch of Death

When you choose this archetype at level 2, your unarmed damage becomes necrotic damage, and you may use your Intelligence bonus instead of your Strength bonus when calculating your unarmed damage.

Additionally, you learn how to use the very life force of your victims. Whenever you deal necrotic damage to a living target with a CR of ¼ or higher, you gain half the damage

dealt as temporary hit points. You can never have more of these temporary hit points than twice your proficiency bonus, and you may not benefit from temporary hit points from more than one creature at a time.

Finally, all spells of the necromancy school become wizard spells for you (see the full list at the end of this archetype description).

## Speak With Dead

Also at 2nd level you gain the ability to speak with the dead. You can cast the

3rd-level spell *speak with dead* as an action without expending any spell slots. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until after you take a long rest.

At 10th level you gain the ability to use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus between long rests.

## Create Minion

At 2nd level you gain the power to create a permanent undead minion for yourself. The minion follows your orders. If it is destroyed, or if you choose to dismiss it (which permanently destroys the minion) you may create a new minion once you have taken a long rest. You may only have one minion at a time, and minions created in this way cannot create or summon other creatures themselves.

To create a minion you must spend one hour performing an unholy ritual. At the end of the hour, your minion arrives.

Your minion may be any non-elite undead creature with a Challenge Rating lower than half your wizard level (round down). For example, at 3rd level, you can create a CR 1 minion such as a ghoul, and at 7th level you may create a CR 3 minion, such as a mummy.

## Necrotic Mastery

At 6th level, you may choose to substitute necrotic damage for any damage type caused by one of your spells.

Additionally, you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

## Army of Darkness

At 10th level you gain the ability to maintain a number of undead minions created using your Create Minion ability. You can maintain a number of minions with a total CR equal to or less than your wizard level, although no individual minion may have a CR equal to or greater than half your wizard level.

For example, at 10th level you would be able to maintain two CR 4 banshees and a CR 2 ghast; or you could maintain three CR 3 mummies and a CR 1 ghoul.

## Command Undead

At 14th level you become a true master of the undead. You may use a bonus action to command one undead creature which can hear you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw vs. your spell DC. On a failure, the undead creature becomes unable to attack you for one minute, and obeys your commands for the duration. The creature can make a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

Once a creature succeeds in a saving throw against this feature, it becomes immune to the feature for 24 hours.
