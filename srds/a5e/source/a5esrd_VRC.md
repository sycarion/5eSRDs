# Origins

#### Additional Proficiencies and Languages

**Arcana.** The existing Arcana skill covers knowledge of psionics, psionic items, and psionic creatures, all of which are also available as specialties. If magic exists in the game setting, then Arcana deals with that area of knowledge as usual also; if the setting does not include magic then this skill simply covers psionic elements.

**Engineering**. The existing Engineering skill adds *robotics* and *starships* to its list of specialties.

**Science.** Science is a broad skill measuring a character’s aptitude or knowledge of the hard or advanced sciences that aren’t covered by Engineering, Nature, or Medicine, and how to apply them to best effect. Specialties include *chemistry, physics, astronomy, earth science*, and *mathematics*.

**Tools.** Adding to the land and sea vehicle proficiencies, voidrunners may also have access to air and space vehicles, along with a range of specialist tools. The computers tool proficiency measures a character’s knowledge of automated systems and devices and allows them to operate electronics and machines.

**Weapons.** Added to simple, martial, and rare weapon proficiencies, characters may also gain proficiency in starship weapons.

**Machine.** Machine is the digital language, a high speed binary dialect most often spoken between artificial lifeforms. It can awkwardly and slowly be spoken by organic creatures, but its true home will always be in the digital world transmitted between devices.

#### Languages

While no civilization is a monolith, many planets have at least one “official” language that government business is conducted in.

Additionally, with the interconnectivity that starships and high technology bring, nearly every planet has been exposed to what is known as Common. The Narrator may include additional languages based on the game’s setting, but the following languages are a default part of the game: Common, Machine.

# Heritage

Android

#### Android Traits

All androids share common traits that set them apart from purely organic beings.

**Age.** An android’s lifespan varies widely depending on its purpose. Some are constructed with predetermined lifespans, some built on organic frames that face insurmountable aging challenges, and others are potentially immortal with proper maintenance, upgrades, and care.

**Size.** Small or Medium, unless otherwise stated by your gift.

**Speed.** 30 feet.

**Artificial Advantage.** You have the construct creature type instead of humanoid. You are immune to poison damage and do not need to breathe. You do have to consume Supply, though this takes the form of power cells or other fuel, rather than food.

**Constructed Constitution.** Many standard healing methods for humanoids are completely ineffective on you, as in the case of psionic powers. Medical treatments utilizing nanobots work on you as normal, however, and specialized treatments exist. Most rolls that would call for a Medicine check for an organic creature are substituted for an Engineering check, depending on the condition and availability of parts.

Additionally, you can still expend Hit Dice

and regain hit points as normal on a short or long rest due to your self-repair functions.

**Basic Programming.** You gain proficiency in computers.

#### Android Gifts

You gain the following heritage gift.

**Access Ports.** You are able to plug into computer systems directly, granting you an expertise die on all computers checks when you are within reach of the target system.

**Armored Chassis.** You are built to withstand the violence of battle.

While you wear no other armor your chassis provides an AC of 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You also have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) rolls due to the clank of metal, the buzz of processors or the whirring of mechanized parts. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

You can select this trait a second time to gain an AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier instead.

**Compact.** Your size is Tiny. You gain a +1 to your Armor Class against creatures of a size category larger than you.

You can select this trait a second time, gaining the ability to hover up to 5 feet off the ground and a fly speed equal to your normal Speed.

Your carrying capacity is halved and you can’t carry bulky items. Additionally, you suffer disadvantage when wielding

weapons without the light property and can’t use shields or armor that haven’t been made for you (this restriction doesn’t apply to force shields). Customizing items or equipment for your size generally costs three times as much as the item’s standard price. Your base Speed is 25 feet.

**Enhanced Senses.** You gain proficiency and an expertise die in Perception. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Expert Subroutines.** You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, Science, or Religion. In addition, you gain a specialty of your choice in the chosen skill.

Choose the damage type of this weapon when you first select this trait from the following list: slashing, piercing, bludgeoning, fire, lightning.

**Jump Jets.** You can jump 30 feet vertically and horizontally. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, after which you must take a long rest in order to reset your uses.

**Linguist.** You are programmed with many languages. You can automatically speak, sign, understand, and write in any current language by making a DC 10 Culture check. Extinct languages require a DC 15 History check. This does not enable you to break codes, cyphers, or encryptions.

**Mechanized Might.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and you can carry a number of additional bulky items equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Mimic.** You have a voice synthesizer which can mimic any voice or sound.

**Organic Appearance.** Your synthetic technological capabilities are subtle and not immediately apparent to the casual observer.

Your inorganic systems are hidden beneath layers of skin-like polymers making you look wholly organic without close inspection.

Creatures can discern your cybernetic nature if they observe you take lightning damage or if they succeed on a Medicine check against your passive Deception.

**Reconnaissance Drone.** You have the service of a **utility drone** (you may select any variety of utility drone), a robot you command with voice control or through one of your devices. Your drone normally rests in a docking port amidst your machinery, but you can deploy it as an action. In combat it takes its turn immediately after you. It follows your

directions, but commanding it to Attack uses your action and its reaction. Repairing your drone is free if you have access to its remains and your gear over the course of a long rest. Otherwise, the materials to replace your drone cost 25 credits.

**Sentinel.** Your charge cycle does not require you to lose consciousness. This allows you to monitor systems and perform other low level activities and you remain fully conscious during rests.

**Tractor Beam.** You have the power to project a small tractor beam as an action. This beam can reach up to 30 feet, carry up to 10 pounds, and can be used to operate simple switches. You can move a held object 10 feet each round using your bonus action.

#### Human Gifts

Humans are highly adaptable. Their originally remarkable physical and mental endurance pushed them to adapt to the harshness of the greater galaxy. In addition to the traits found in your human heritage, select one of the following gifts.

##### Adapted

As humans began to venture away from their world and explore the galaxy, they encountered hardships and challenges they never could have imagined—and proved themselves to be one of the most adaptable species in the cosmos. Confronting each new hurdle head-on, humans began to tinker with their genetics, creating new adaptations capable of surviving anything the galaxy could throw at it. Through splicing non-human or synthetic DNA,

ancestors of these humans take human survival skills to a new frontier. Beyond basic survivability, you are adapted for one specific environment. You gain the following trait:

*Just Like Home:* Choose one type of terrain, reflecting the area from which your family hails: arctic, desert, mountain, or swamp. You ignore all naturally created difficult terrain of that type. Additionally, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made within this terrain type, and gain a type of damage resistance related to your chosen terrain: arctic—cold, desert—fire,

mountain—lightning, swamp—poison.

##### Diehard Survivor

Foes of humanity may see them as ants, but humans are equally difficult to eliminate. The ancestors of human beings learned to survive through the harshest conditions, including drought, winter, and famine.

Humans, in their stubbornness, can even pull themselves back from the brink of death to fulfill their dreams. You have the following traits:

**Feast and Famine.** You can tighten your belt during hard times. You can go a number of days equal to your Constitution modifier without suffering any fatigue from lack of Supply. Afterward you require twice as much Supply for as many days as you went without.

**Radical Perseverance.** Through your sheer stubbornness and will to live, you sometimes manage to wriggle out of death’s grasp. You die after 4 failed death saving throws instead of 3.

##### Ingenious Focus

Not all human minds work the same—some have a nearly miraculous level of focus.

People with this intellectual mode often bring a surprising level of insight and passion to almost any topic they engage. In spite of their brilliance, they typically have difficulty with more general awareness. You have the following traits:

**Inexorable Concentration.** When you fail a Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration, you can immediately reroll it, taking the new result. You may use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), and regain all expended uses after a long rest.

**Resident Expert.** You have a reputation for painstaking detail on certain tasks and subjects. Choose two tools with which you are proficient, or a skill with which you are proficient. When you make a check with that tool or skill and the d20 shows a natural result of less than 10, you can count the d20 result as being 10.

##### Jovian

Growing up on a high-gravity world has lent you remarkable endurance. You recover one level of fatigue during a short rest as long as you have only two or fewer levels of fatigue, and you count as size Large when determining your carrying capacity.

##### Prodigy

Humans once believed they only used a portion of their total brain, and that using more would give them access to supernatural abilities. Whether through natural or forced evolution, space-time anomalies, or other strange quirks of galactic exploration, some humans have evolved beyond the limitations of the physical. Many people with this gift are marked by some telltale sign of their mental power or their evolution, such as glowing eyes or loss of vestigial or unused traits.

Your natural abilities allow you limited ability to command a potent effect. Choose a level I psionic power. You know your chosen power and you can manifest it once without expending psionic points. You must finish a long or a short rest before you can manifest it in this way again. Your manifesting ability modifier for this trait is the same as the ability score used in the manifesting class in which you have the

highest level, or Intelligence if you have no levels in a manifesting class.

##### Spirited Traveler

The power of movement is one of humanity’s evolutionary advantages. An ancient human hunting strategy for killing fast game is persistence hunting—following prey relentlessly, shifting between walking and running endlessly until a beast became too exhausted to defend itself. Many humans maintain their health through running, and foot races are a universal favorite game. In a word, humans gifted at running will go far. You have the following traits:

**Desperate Dash.** When you take the Dash action, your movement this turn does not provoke opportunity attacks.

During this movement, you gain an expertise die on Athletics checks made to jump, and Dexterity saving throws. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest .

**Marathon Runner.** The first time between each long rest you would gain a level of fatigue, you do not gain that level of fatigue. You still suffer a level of fatigue from finishing a long rest without any Supply.

**Sojourner’s Fortitude.** You gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist fatigue for marching longer than 8 hours.

##### Unbound

When humans began to venture into deep space, many never settled down. Whether living their lives as asteroid miners within their solar system, living aboard space stations, or as members of generational colony ships, some humans found themselves particularly suited to life within zero gravity. For some, this is evolution in action, for others it is wanderlust turned outward toward the stars. You have the following traits:

**Space Legs.** You are adapted to the unique rigors of zero gravity, suffering minimal disorientation and even showing increased mobility. While in zero gravity,

your base speed increases by 10 feet and you gain a climb speed equal to your base speed.

**Vacuum Resistance.** The harsh vacuum of space is an ever-present threat in space travel, but you are adapted to it, for a time. You gain an expertise die to Constitution checks to resist the effects of a hard vacuum, and add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you can hold your breath. In addition, you gain resistance to cold damage.

#### Human Paragon

When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of humankind, and you gain one paragon gift from the following list.

##### Determined

When you are bloodied and make an attack roll or saving throw, you can use this feature to treat the result of the d20 roll as a natural 20. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

##### Enduring Persistence

You become proficient in your choice of two saving throws.

##### Supreme Adaption

***Prerequisite***: *Adapted*

You are now immune to the damage type you were resistant to and gain darkvision to 30 feet (or extend your existing darkvision by that amount).

##### Voracious Learner

You gain an expertise die in each of three different skill or tool proficiencies.

##### Wind At Your Back

Your Speed increases by 10 feet. You ignore difficult terrain when you Dash. When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature, until the end of your turn you do not provoke opportunity attacks from it.

##### Suggested Cultures

While you can choose any culture for your human character, the following cultures are linked closely with this heritage: backwater, belter, drifter, imperium subject, underclass, union, urbanite.

##### Indomitable

While at one of these locations, you and your companions are treated to a rich lifestyle by a fan, as long as you indulge them with appearances at parties and the like. Being recognized can be a double-edged sword, however. There may be no such thing as bad publicity, but there’s no end of bad intentions.

***Adventures and Advancement*.** You might not be actively pursuing the limelight right now, but you still have influence that grows with every mission you undertake. Powerful figures will seek you out to endorse or decry certain people or policies as the media clamors for your opinions. The more you accept these jobs and lean into your role, the more well known you become until your face is seen across the galaxy. You gain the benefits of your Star Power feature on every settled planet.

***Adventures and Advancement.*** It’s more likely that your corporate past is going to bring you trouble as you adventure more and more. Life as a voidrunner might put you against the corporation itself, and is more than likely to force you to face the consequences of choices you made back in the company days.

Often overlooked, a child or beggar may come to you with important information they overheard. Furthermore, you can consult the whisper network yourself. If you roll lower than a 15 on an

Investigation check to gather information while in a space port, capital ship, or city, your roll is treated as a 15.

##### Psionic Powers

At 1st level you have learned to tap into your reservoir of psychic energy to manifest and channel psionic powers.

Reflexes

At 1st level, you learn certain fundamentals of psionics. Level 0 psionic powers, called reflexes, can be channeled without spending psionic points. You learn one reflex of your choice from the psionics powers list. You learn additional reflexes of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Reflexes Known column of the Psion table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the psychic reflexes you know with another reflex from the psionics powers list.

Psionic Points

The Psion table shows the total number of psionic points you have. To use one of your psionic powers, you must expend a number of points equal to its level. When you finish a short rest, you may expend one or more hit dice to regain some of your energy. You gain a number of psionic points equal to the result, up to your total psionic points.

You regain all spent psionic points when you finish a long rest.

Psionic Powers Known of Rating I And Higher

You know one level I psionic power of your choice from the psionic powers list. Whenever your power rating increases, as shown in the Power Rating column of the Psion table, you learn one new power of your choice. This power must be of a level less than or equal to your power rating.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace one power you know with a different power of your choice. This power must also be of a level less than or equal to your power rating.

Psionics Ability

There are many paths to mental mastery. Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma to be your psionics ability. Once you make this choice, you cannot change it. You use the chosen ability whenever a power or feature refers to your psionics ability. In addition, you use that ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic power or feature and when making an attack roll with one.

**Psionics save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier

**Psionics attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen ability modifier

Psionic Focus

You can use a psionic focus, such as a psychic crystal, for any of your powers. This enables you to concentrate on one additional power you know, as long as the sum of the powers’ levels is less than or equal to your power rating. If you have to make a check to maintain concentration, roll for both powers individually.

###### Psionic Blast

Starting at 1st level you learn to direct your mental energies as a focused blast. Choose a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, lightning, psychic, or thunder. Your Psionic Blast deals damage of the chosen type, also called your primary damage type. Once this choice is made it cannot be changed. You can use an action to strike a creature you can see within 30 feet. Make a ranged psionic attack against the creature, dealing 1d8 damage plus your psionic ability modifier of the chosen type. The damage dealt increases as you gain Psion levels, as shown in the Blast Damage column of the Psion table.

###### Cognitive Discoveries

At 2nd level you gain one cognitive discovery of your choice. As a psion, much of your exploration is inward facing.

However, sometimes being aware of your surroundings is exactly what is needed to reach the next level of psionic mastery. Your discoveries are detailed at the end of the class description.The Discoveries Known column of the Psion table shows when you learn more cognitive discoveries. If you gain a bonus discovery, it does not count against your Discoveries known.

###### Psionic Speciality

When you reach 2nd level and again at 11th level, you can choose a psionic discipline to specialize in: dynakinetic, kinesthetic, telekinetic, or telepathic. All psionic powers belong to one or more of these disciplines. As your psionic power grows, your focused dedication allows you to manifest more strongly within one discipline over the others. You gain the following benefits from

this focused specialization:

* You learn one power from this discipline. This power does not count against your number of powers known.
* Once per long rest you can manifest a power you know from this discipline without expending points from your reservoir as long as that power’s level doesn’t exceed your current power rating. You must still expend points for any surge options you wish to apply.

###### Unassailable Ego

At 2nd level, the ability to transform reality with the power of your mind requires removing any self-imposed limits or doubts. It requires a measure of belief that borders on blind faith. Choose one of the following features.

Ambition

You believe you are born for greatness and nothing must stand in your way; the rules that pertain to most don’t apply to you. You gain proficiency with History and Intimidation or an

expertise die if you already have proficiency.

Order

You believe you must always follow a strict code, whether that be religious or legal.

Whatever the consequences, the ends justify the means. You gain proficiency with Culture and Investigation or an

expertise die if you already have proficiency.

Selflessness

You believe your powers must be used in service to a greater purpose. You gain proficiency with Medicine and Religion or an expertise die if you already have proficiency.

###### Psion Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose a psion archetype that reflects the journey upon which you have embarked, which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th and 15th level.

###### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

###### Demanding Excellence

At 4th level, and again at 9th and 17th level, choose one of the following skills: Insight, Perception, Persuasion, or Religion. You gain proficiency with the chosen skill. If you are already proficient, you gain an expertise die in that skill instead.

###### Psionic Effort

Starting at 5th level, you may use a bonus action to expend one or more hit dice to gain a number of psionic points equal to the number of hit dice you expended.

###### Enhanced Blast

At 6th level choose two of the following improvements to your Psionic Blast feature. A level prerequisite refers to your level in the psion class.

You may choose one additional improvement from this list at 9th level, and again at 12th level and 18th level. Unless otherwise noted, these effects are cumulative. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the improvements you know and replace it with another improvement that you could learn at that level.

Blast Accuracy

You gain an expertise die to your Psionic Blast attack roll. You can choose this enhancement multiple times, improving the expertise die each time.

Blast Alternator

Each time you use your Psionic Blast, you can choose to inflict a damage type based on your Unassailable Ego choice: force (Order), necrotic (Ambition), or radiant (Selflessness).

Blast Multiplier

*Prerequisite 9th level*

When you make a Psionic Blast attack, you can make a second Psionic Blast attack at a different target.

Blast Output

Your Psionic Blast deals additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

Blast Radius

You can pick a spot within range instead of individual targets. All creatures within 10 feet of that spot are targeted, but your damage is halved.

Blast Range

Your range increases by 30 feet.

Blast Response

When a creature you can see within 30 feet deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to make one Psionic Blast attack against it.

###### Guarded Mind

At 10th level, you gain resistance to psychic damage. Additionally, choose one of the following conditions: charmed, frightened, poisoned, rattled. Once between long rests when you would suffer the chosen condition, you can choose to ignore it instead.

At 15th level you can use this feature with all of the listed conditions.

###### Mental Fortitude

##### Psion Archetypes

Psion archetypes are paths of self revelation, each a journey towards becoming one’s true self through discipline, training, exploration, and reflection.

###### Augur

Augurs are empathic visionaries, able to see the unseen and part the swirling mists of the future. Psions that travel this path often speak of living two lives: one in the present, another in the myriad of possible futures.

Seeker’s Vision

At 3rd level, when you take this archetype you can sense the whereabouts of things you seek. Once between rests you can use an action to focus your thoughts on a specified target to instantly determine whether the target you seek is within 30 feet.

**Object.** Name or describe in detail an object familiar to you. You detect the closest example of a certain type of object (for example an instrument, item of furniture, compass, or vase).

**Animal or Plant.** Name or describe in detail a specific kind of beast or plant. You detect the closest example of the targeted type.

**Creature.** Name or describe in detail a specific creature type familiar to you. You detect the nearest creature of that type.

By spending psionic points, you can extend your search in the following ways:

**Extended Detection.** You can spend 1 additional psionic point to seek a target within 1,000 feet and determine direction and distance to the sought target.

**Extended Duration.** You can spend 2 additional psionic points to channel this feature for up to 1 hour, and you have advantage on Investigation checks to find a hidden target when it is within 30 feet.

**Greater Detection.** You can spend 2

additional psionic points to increase your range to 5 miles, and you are drawn to the target, as if it is calling to you. You can pinpoint its location (including its current trajectory if it’s traveling), and can continue to do so if channeling this feature. You can locate a specific or unique object, provided that you have observed it within 30 feet at least once.

**World-Wide Detection.** You can spend 3 additional psionic points to increase your range to planetary, and you can locate a specific or unique creature known to you, provided that you have observed it within 30 feet at least once.

Beginner’s Luck

Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with all gaming sets and an expertise die when playing them for stakes.

Deja Vu

At 7th level, certain actions you take or observe feel familiar, as if you have experienced them before. Upon completing a long rest, you gain three expertise dice: a d4, a d6, and a d8. You can use your reaction to grant an expertise die to any d20 roll made by you or a creature within 120 feet. You must use the dice in ascending order. Any remaining dice are lost when you begin a long rest

The Future is Now

At 15th level, through the force of your psionic will, you can peer into and attempt to alter the immediate future. Once between short or long rests, you can use your reaction to force one die of a rolled result to be rerolled. This result can be an ability check, an attack roll, a damage roll, expended hit dice, an initiative roll, a saving throw, or even a roll on a random table. You can choose to whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

###### Mindshear

The mindshear psion is a master telepath, not simply capable of communicating by mental linkage, but able to draw out private thoughts, remove and replace memories, and even manipulate a creature’s sense of the here and now.

Inconceivable

At 3rd level, you gain an expertise die to Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion checks.

Towering Intellect

Also at 3rd level, the following level II powers count as level I powers for you: *enervate*, *mirage*, and *push thought*, and you can manifest *telepathic messaging* as a reflex.

Bend Will

Starting at 7th level, you can assert control over a target’s mind by using an action. The type of creature you can target is based on your psion level, as shown on the table below.

TABLE: BEND WILL

**Level Target**

7th One beast

9th One humanoid 17th One creature

The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your psionics save DC. On a failure, the creature is charmed by you as long as you are channeling this feature. If the target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to this feature for 24 hours. If it is engaged in combat with you or creatures friendly to you, it has advantage on its saving throw. You can channel this feature for 1 minute. The channeling limit increases with your power rating: 10 minutes at a rating of IV, 1 hour at V, and 8 hours at VI.

Until the charmed condition ends,

you establish a telepathic link with the target while you are in the same planetary system. You can use an action to give the creature a command. Alternatively, you can assume direct control over the target. Until the end of your next turn, you experience the world as it does, gaining the benefit of any special sense it has. You decide all of the target’s actions on its turn, and it does nothing you do not allow it to. While doing so you are blind and deaf to your own body’s surroundings. If the creature is killed or falls unconscious while you are controlling it, you suffer a level of strife. While a target is directly controlled in this way, you can also use your own reaction to make it use a reaction.

The effect ends if you or your companions do anything harmful towards the target. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new saving throw, ending the effect and breaking your concentration on a success. The target knows it was charmed by you when the effect ends. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

Cognitive Dissonance

At 15th level, you can telepathically fill a creature’s mind with beliefs and attitudes in direct opposition to its typical thinking. Once between long rests you can spend an action to target one creature within 30 feet. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your psionics ability DC. On a failure, the creature takes 9d10 psychic damage and becomes confused until the beginning of your next turn. A target that succeeds on its saving throw takes half damage and is slowed rather than confused.

You can use your reaction to channel this feature for up to 1 minute; while you are channeling, a creature that failed its initial saving throw makes an additional saving throw at the beginning of each of your turns or remains confused and suffers 1d10 psychic damage.

By spending psionic points, you can

enhance the effects of this feature in the following ways:

**Additional Target.** You spend 1 psionic point to target one additional creature within range.

**Increased Range.** Your range for this ability increases to 60 feet.

A creature that is immune to being charmed is immune to this feature.

###### Voidmender

Voidmenders are those who study the effects of psionic power on the living body, with a focus on healing and restoration.

Lend Health

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to share a portion of your physical well-being with another creature. You can use a bonus action to touch a creature and grant it 1d4+1 temporary hit points. You lose a number of hit points equal to those healed but regain 1 hit point at the beginning of each of your subsequent turns, up to the amount initially lost. This psionic regeneration ends early if you fall unconscious. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses whenever you finish a long rest.

Accelerate Healing

* As a bonus action, you may target one creature within 60 feet and cause its body to regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your psionics ability modifier. The number of hit points regained increases by 2d4 each time your power rating increases.
* You spend 10 minutes meditating over up to 6 targets within 30 feet.

Each target you meditate over in this way regains hit points equal to 2d8 + your psionics ability modifier. The number of hit points regained increases by 1d8 each time your power rating increases.

* As an action, you can expend two uses of this feature to touch a creature and remove one disease or condition afflicting it. Choose from blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. At the Narrator’s discretion, some diseases may not be curable by this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and regain all expended uses whenever you finish a long rest.

Bedside Manner

Also at 3rd level, you can ease a creature’s pain and suffering just by spending time with it. As a downtime activity or during a short or long rest, you can reduce the duration of a short-term mental stress effect by 1d6 days or temporarily relieve a

long-term mental stress effect for the next 2d4 days.

At power rating II, you can use this feature to wholly remove a short-term mental stress effect; at power rating III, you can remove a long-term mental stress effect. At the Narrator’s discretion, some mental stress effects might not be relieved or removed by this feature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, you regain all expended uses whenever you finish a long rest.

Transfuse Vitality

At 7th level, you can heal a creature you touch by transferring and magnifying life essence from another source. On the round you manifest this feature, and as an action on subsequent turns while channeling it, you can make a ranged psionic attack against a creature within 15 feet. This attack automatically hits a willing donor. On a hit,

you deal 1d6 necrotic damage and a chosen creature you can see within 15 feet regains hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt. You can spend psionic points, up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus, to increase the necrotic damage dealt by 1d6 per psionic point spent. You can channel this feature for 1 minute.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, you regain all expended uses of whenever you finish a long rest.

Reconstitute Life

At 15th Level you can bring the dead back to life. You can spend 1 hour focused on harmonizing a dead creature’s lifeless body with its departed consciousness. Provided the target’s soul is willing and able to return to its body, and has not been dead for more than 1 year, it returns to life with all of its hit points. This feature requires a psychic crystal worth at least 25,000 credits, which is consumed in the process.

This feature cures any poisons and diseases, closes all mortal wounds, and restores any missing body parts that affected the target at the time of death. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

Once you use this feature you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

###### Warstorm

Warstorm psions are those who master the manipulation of objects, matter, and energy. As the moniker suggests, warstorms are particularly adept at waging war. However, some dedicate their efforts to defending a cause, while others are simply in search of self perfection, seeking worthy opponents against whom they might sharpen their skills.

Blaster

At 3rd level, the range of your

psionic blast increases to 60 feet.

Energization

When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to momentarily transform matter into energy and back again. You can use a bonus action to transmute a melee weapon, piece of ammunition, natural weapon, or unarmed strike which you can see into a specific energy type of your choice, inflicting damage of the chosen type on a hit, as well as an additional effect as shown on the following table. The energy reverts to its original matter immediately after a successful hit or at the beginning of next turn, whichever comes first. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your psionic ability modifier. Your expended uses reset when you finish a long rest.

TABLE: ENERGIZATION

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **ENERGY TYPE** | **EFFECT** |
| Fire | Deals an additional 1d6 fire damage and ignites flammable materials requiring an action and a free hand to put out |
| Cold | Deals an additional 1d6 cold damage and delays the target’s initiative count for its next turn by a number equal to the additional cold damage done. Its initiative remains at the new value for the remainder of the encounter |
| Lightning | Deals an additional 2d4 lightning damage, which increases to 3d4 lightning damage if the target is wearing metal armor and disarms a creature wielding a metal weapon if they fail a Strength saving throw vs. your psionics save DC. |
| Force | Deals an additional 1d4 force damage and pushes a Medium or smaller sized creature back 10 feet |
| Psychic | Deals an additional 1d4 psychic damage and causes the target to suffer disadvantage on its next attack |

The damage from this feature increases by 1 die when you reach 7th, 12, and 15th level in this class.

Willful Endurance

Also at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your psion level.

Vortex

At 7th level, you can create a vortex of wind and energy that captures creatures and objects within it. You use an action to form a vortex within 30 feet of you and direct it to move up to 30 feet. When a creature shares its space with the vortex for the first time during this movement, that creature makes a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is carried inside the vortex, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet it is carried, and falls prone into the nearest unoccupied square at the end of the movement as the vortex dissipates. The vortex can carry either one Large creature, two Medium creatures, or up to four Small or smaller creatures.

Storm Quake

At 15th level, your psychic control over elemental energies can produce a force of devastating destruction. Once between long rests, you can use an action to target a point on the ground within 500 feet. You create a psychokinetic disturbance in a 50 foot radius centered on that point, and an intense tremor of force rips through the area, pummeling anything that comes in contact with it. You can channel this feature for 1 minute.

The ground in the affected area becomes difficult terrain as it warps and cracks. When you manifest this feature, each creature in the affected area must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw against

your psionics save DC or take 1d6 force damage and be knocked prone. At the end of each of your turns until channeling ends, choose one of the following effects to wreak havoc within the area.

**Electrical Storm.** Each creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save or half damage on a successful save.

**Crushing Gravity.** Each creature makes a Strength saving throw or takes 3d6 force damage and is knocked prone.

**Thunderclap.** Each creature makes a Constitution saving throw or takes 2d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 5 minutes.

###### Emergent Psionics

At 1st level, you have expanded your mind, and your latent psionic powers have begun to manifest in meaningful ways.

Psionics Ability

While mastering control of their psychic talent takes effort and discipline, a psyknight’s connection to it is intuitive and natural. Wisdom is your psionics ability for your powers. You use your Wisdom whenever a power of feature refers to your psionics ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionics power or feature and when making an attack roll with one.

**Psionics save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Psionics attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Psychic Impulse

**Snap Reflex.** If you use your reaction to make an attack of opportunity, you can immediately make a second attack against the same target.

**Gut Feeling.** You gain an expertise die on your next Perception check.

###### Psionic Guard

Whether by subconscious telekinetic shield or heightened dodge reflexes, at 1st level you learn psionic defensive techniques.

Choose one of the following options.

Foreseeing Guard

While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Wisdom modifier + your Dexterity modifier.

Unseen Shield

While you are wearing armor, you replace your Dexterity modifier with your psionics ability modifier for AC.

###### Psychic Isometrics

At 1st level, you gain one psychic isometric of your choice. Your isometrics are detailed at the end of the class description. The Isometrics Known column of the Psyknight table shows when you learn more psychic isometrics. If you gain a bonus isometric, it does not count against your isometrics known.

###### Kinetic Burst

Starting at 1st level you can use a bonus action to direct a burst of psychokinetic force at a creature or object within 30 feet. Make a ranged psionic attack against the

creature, dealing force damage equal to 1d6

+ your Wisdom modifier. Each time your power rating increases (at levels 8, 14, and 20), your Kinetic Burst damage increases by 1d4. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining spent uses when you complete a long rest.

###### Code of Conscience

Transcending the physical nature of one’s own body requires an unwavering strength of will. By aligning with a core set of values, you narrow your focus and solidify your will. At 2nd level, choose an option from the following.

The High Road

You value life and peace, understanding that powers used irresponsibly can cause great harm. As an action you can expend one of your hit dice and roll it. An adjacent creature you can touch recovers a number of hit points equal to your roll. You cannot gain hit points yourself by using this feature. Additionally, you gain an expertise die with Persuasion checks.

The Steep Climb

You value knowledge and power, trusting in and relying on no one but yourself to excel; others are but footholds to boost you ever higher. As a bonus action you can expend one of your hit dice and roll it. The next attack you make does additional damage equal to your roll. Additionally, you gain an expertise die with Intimidation checks.

The Axis of Balance

You value the natural ebb and flow of the universe, respecting the danger of upsetting the cosmic balance and seeing past the constraints of a binary morality. As an action you can expend one of your hit dice and roll

it. You recover a number of hit points equal to your roll. Additionally, you gain an expertise die with Insight checks.

###### Combat Maneuvers

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Ace Starfighter, Blazing Starglaive, Mindful Body, Mirror’s Glint, Rapid Current, Razor’s Edge, and Tooth and Claw. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of the Psyknight table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same level from a tradition you are proficient with.

###### Psionic Powers

Beginning at 2nd level, your true psychic aptitude has become evident and your training allows you to harness your psionic talent.

Reflexes

At 2nd level, you learn certain fundamentals of psionics. Power level 0 psionic powers, called reflexes, can be used without spending psionic points.

You learn one reflex of your choice from the psionic powers list. You learn additional reflexes of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Reflexes

Known column of the Psyknight table. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the psychic reflexes you know with another reflex from the psionics powers list.

Psychic Exertion

You gain access to a reservoir of psychic energy. Your access to this energy is represented by your exertion pool. You spend 1 exertion point for each psionic point required to fuel a psionic power or feature.

Psionic Powers Known of Rating I And Higher

You know one level I psionic power of your choice from the psionic powers list.

Whenever your power rating increases, as shown in the Power Rating column of the Psion table, you learn one new power of your choice. This power must be of a level less than or equal to your power rating.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace one power you know with a different power of your choice. This power must also be of a level less than or equal to your power rating.

Psionic Focus

You can use a psychic crystal as a psionic focus for any of your powers.

###### Extra Effort

At 3rd level, your exertion pool increases by 1 exertion point. At every third psyknight class level (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th) your pool increases by an additional exertion point. In addition, you regain use of an expended Psychic Impulse feature at the end of a short rest.

###### Psyknight Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose a psyknight archetype that results from your hours of training and dedication. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 9th, and 14th level.

###### Starwielder Tactics

Psyknights integrate psychic powers into their combat styles to great effect. Some tactics use exertion points, and if a tactic requires a saving throw you use your psionics save DC.

At 4th level, you learn two starwielder tactics of your choice from the list below. You learn one additional tactic at 7th level, and again 11th, 15th, and 18th level. Some tactics have requirements, such as a minimum psyknight level or another starwielder tactic. You must meet those requirements before you choose that starwielder tactic.

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

###### Extra Attack

At 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the attack action on your turn.

###### Guarded Mind

At 10th level you gain resistance to psychic damage and choose one of the following conditions against which to guard: charmed, frightened, poisoned, or rattled. Once between long rests when you would suffer the chosen condition, you can choose to ignore it instead. At 15th level you can choose another condition from the options above or from the following: confused, incapacitated, or unconscious.

###### Glaring Recognition

By 13th level, the code by which you live visibly leaves its mark on you and impacts your social interactions. Your eyes and complexion reflect the deep emotions gathered within as you strive to control every aspect of your core being.

**Illumination (The High Road).** Your eyes give off a soft glow, exuding peace and comfort. You gain darkvision within 30 feet, and you gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. If you already had darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

**Flames (The Steep Climb).** Blazing fire seems to smolder in your eyes and burn in your veins, making you feverish to the touch. You gain resistance to fire damage and an expertise die on Intimidation checks.

**Mystery (The Axis of Balance).** Like dark pools reflecting the infinite night sky, your eyes are impossible to fathom. You gain truesight within 5 feet and an expertise die on Insight checks.

###### Master Wielder

At 17th level, power both awesome and terrible is at your fingertips. Choose one of the following:

Bladed Victory

Your combat skill is unparalleled. You can use your action and forgo your bonus action and reaction to leap, flip, sunder, and strike in quick succession all over the battlefield performing a bladed victory. While performing a bladed victory your Speed doubles, and your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks until the start of your next turn.

While performing a bladed victory you may move, make an attack against a single target, move, and attack a second target. You may repeat this process until you have no movement speed remaining. You cannot attack any target more than once, and you must move at least 5 feet between attacks.

Once you use this feature you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

Crushing Weight

Your powers of telekinesis know no bounds. When you use this feature you exert an invisible force of pressure that can counter a starship’s engines or crumple a blast door like a sheet of paper. As an action you can spend 1 or more exertion and make a ranged psionic attack against an object you can see. On a hit, you deal 1d12 force damage for each point of exertion that you spend.

Alternatively, you can choose to do no damage but instead to halt a vehicle or starship which is not moving at FTL speed. Spend exertion equal to the ship’s grade (minimum 1 exertion). The ship’s speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

Impervious Defense

While wielding a starglaive you can use a bonus action and spend 1 exertion point to enter a defensive state of mind. Your starglaive moves so fast, it forms a

translucent sphere 5 feet in diameter centered on you until the start of your next turn. Neither matter nor energy can penetrate your shielding sphere, your speed is halved, and you cannot benefit from your extra attack feature, but you can otherwise move and take actions as normal.

###### Beyond Death

At 20th level you are at the apex of your training. Your martial skills are honed to perfection, and your psionic power is formidable. You have finally learned how to overcome even death itself.

When you die, except when you die of old age, you return to life, fully healed, the next day. Optionally, you can choose not to return to life, and instead pass into the next world.

##### Psychic Isometrics

When you gain access to a new psychic isometric, choose one of the following. You can learn the discovery at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your psyknight level.

###### Cognitive Discovery

You learn one of the following Psion Cognitive Discoveries which counts as a Psychic Isometric for you: Into the Void (Prerequisite: Suspended Breath), Sense Disturbance, Suspended Breath. You may take this Isometric more than once.

###### Diplomatic Intervention

You can spend 1 exertion point and use an action to reduce the effects of strong and harmful emotions within 10 feet. You choose which of the following effects to apply to

each sentient organic creature within the area.

* A target suffering the charmed or frightened condition makes a new saving throw against the DC of the effect that caused the condition and gains a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on the roll.
* A target that has hostile feelings towards creatures of your choice makes a Charisma saving throw or its hostile feelings are suppressed until the end of your next turn. This suppression ends early if a target is attacked or sees its allies being attacked.

###### Faceless Mask

You have honed your ability to conceal your presence from others. You gain an expertise die on Stealth and Performance checks made to disappear into a crowd.

###### Haptic Feedback

*Prerequisite 3rd level*

You gain tremorsense with a range of 10 feet. You may take this isometric a second time to extend the range of your tremorsense to 30 feet.

###### Mind and Body

You double your Strength score when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can lift, push, or drag. In addition, during a short rest, you can participate in strenuous activity (e.g. scouting the area, physical exercise, combat training or sparring, etc.) for up to 30 minutes and still gain the benefits of the rest. During a long rest, you can participate in strenuous activity for up to 1 hour, and your required sleep time is halved. You still require 8 hours of rest, but you only require 4 hours of actual sleep.

###### Negate Fall

When you fall, or jump down, from a height and spend 1 or more exertion points you may treat the falling distance as 30 feet less for each exertion point that you spend.

###### Mystic Hunter

When tracking a creature that can use psionics, you can attempt to do so by focusing on the psychic energy it leaves in its wake, allowing you to use your psionics ability for any ability checks made to track it.

###### Psychic Tradeoff

Whenever you would suffer the enervated condition, you may choose to gain a level of strife or fatigue instead.

###### Psychic Rejuvenation

You can spend an action to use your psionic energy to heal an injured ally within reach. Spend one or more of your ally’s hit dice.

Your ally recovers hit points equal to the total you roll on the expended hit dice.

###### Purge Toxins

*Prerequisite: 3rd Level*

You gain resistance to poison damage and an expertise die on saving throws against being poisoned. Additionally, as an action you can spend 2 exertion points to negate and end one poison affecting you. If more than one poison is affecting you, you negate one poison you know is present (otherwise you negate one at random) and can negate additional poisons with the same action by spending 1 additional exertion point per poison.

###### Endure Elements

For one hour you may ignore environmental effects caused by heat or cold. This feature does not protect you from damage. Once you have used this feature you may not do so again until you have taken a long rest.

###### Suggestive Words

*Prerequisite: 3rd Level*

As an action you make a short suggestion to a creature within 10 feet who can hear and understand you. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it follows your suggestion to the best of its ability. If the suggestion would harm the target or its allies, they target automatically succeeds in its saving throw.

You can use this isometric a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

You regain all spent uses when you finish a long rest.

##### Psyknight Archetypes

Each psyknight learns to command their martial and psionic in ways unique to themselves, but there are archetypes within which psyknights master specific techniques.

###### Auditor

Auditors are psionically trained

law-enforcement agents. Combining potent combat training with expert investigation skills, most people know to behave when an auditor enters the room.

Watchful Eye

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain an expertise die when making Insight or Investigation checks. Additionally, you gain a specialty in each.

Psychic Interrogation

At 6th level you are adept at getting the truth out of suspects. Ask a simple

yes-or-no question of a living creature within 10 feet and which can understand you and spend 1 exertion. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw against your psionics save DC, and on a failed saving throw is compelled to answer the question truthfully.

Speak With The Dead

At 9th level, you are able to read the psychic impressions left by the dead. You may speak with a recently dead creature and ask it up to three questions. The creature must have died within the past 24 hours. You may ask any questions, but the corpse is not obligated to tell the truth, and cannot provide information that it would not have been aware of when alive. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

Detect Lie

Beginning at 14th level, your innate psychic insight and empathic senses are so

finely-tuned that it becomes impossible to lie to you without you knowing it. You automatically know when a creature is not telling the truth. This feature does not give you any other information regarding the truth.

###### Praetor

Praetors are trained in traditional institutions from an early age to serve as guardians and enforcers. As you follow this path, you enhance your natural athleticism with psychic strength and the power of your will.

Construct Starglaive

There are energy weapons, and there are starglaives. When you choose this

archetype at 3rd level, you learn to construct a starglaive at no cost, a custom energy weapon harmonically attuned to your psionic energies via the use of a psychic crystal. The psychic crystal in the weapon can serve as your psionic focus. When you construct this weapon, you may choose the type of damage it causes from the following list: fire, cold; you may also choose from radiant (if you chose The High Road as your Code of Conscience), necrotic (if you chose The Steep Climb), or force (if you chose The Axis of Balance).

If you lose your starglaive or it is destroyed, you may construct a replacement; this process takes one month. You can only attune to one starglaive at a time, and any starglaive you

create using this feature cannot be attuned to by anybody except you.

You are always considered proficient with a starglaive you have constructed.

Starglaive

*Weapon, rare (requires attunement; cost 10,000 credits)*

**Crafting Components:** psychic crystal, psyknight’s Starglaive feature

This customized hilt contains a specially attuned psychic crystal which fuses plasma and force energies into a deadly, superheated blade. A starglaive ignites from the hilt upon activation, shaped from fields of shimmering force energy and infused with vibrantly glowing plasma. The blade casts bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet. Dropping, throwing, or otherwise being disarmed of the starglaive immediately deactivates it (although some psyknights are able to learn techniques which allow them to throw an ignited starglaive). The color of a starglaive’s blade is based on the damage type it inflicts.

**Attunement.** Due to the many intense energies surging through a starglaive, and the inherent dangerousness of the weapon, a creature not attuned to a starglaive has disadvantage on all attack rolls using this weapon. Only creatures with 3 or more psyknight levels may attune to a starglaive.

**Properties.** The starglaive is a medium blade and does 1d12 damage of the type selected when you constructed the weapon, has the defensive (light and medium), parrying, and finesse properties, and weighs 1 lb. Attacks made with a starglaive ignore the parrying property of melee weapons that don’t have an energy augment.

**Cutting.** A starglaive blade can cut through metal, rock, or other heavy duty material up to 2 feet thick at a rate of 2 feet per round.

**Damage Type Starglaive Color**

Cold Blue

Fire Red

Force Yellow

Necrotic Green

Radiant White

Starglaive Variants

In addition to blades, starglaives also come in maul and polearm variants. These variants replace the starglaive’s cutting ability with the following.

**Mauls.** A starglaive maul has the breaker property.

**Polearms**. Starglaive polearms have the two-handed and reach properties.

Greater Starglaives

Some starglaives are greater than others. These legendary weapons grant a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starglaive** | **Rarity** | **Bonus** | **Cost (cr)** | **Level Prerequisite\*** |
| *Starglaive* | Rare | – | 10,000 | Psyknight 3 |
| *Greater Starglaive* | Rare | +1 | 15,000 | Psyknight 7 |
| *Superior Starglaive* | Very Rare | +2 | 19,500 | Psyknight 11 |
| *Supreme Starglaive* | Legendary | +3 | 24,000 | Psyknight 15 |

\*Crafting a greater starglaive requires a higher level pre-requisite than a standard starglaive. This prerequisite is also the minimum psyknight level needed to attune to the weapon.

Preturnatural Defense

Any 6th level your bond with your starglaive is so instinctive that missile deflection does not require a conscious choice. You add your proficiency bonus to your AC against ranged attacks as long as you are wielding a starglaive and are able to make attacks with it.

Focused Physiology

Starting at 9th level, your exertion cost to manifest psionic powers of level II and higher within the kinesthetic discipline is reduced by 1 point (minimum 1).

Overwhelming Presence

At 14th level, your power and reputation are such that your very presence on the field of battle is enough to inspire an enemy to surrender. Your prestige rating increases by 1, and when you take an action to make an Intimidation or Persuasion check and offer a target enemy creature with a Challenge Rating lower than your psyknight level the opportunity to surrender, you can add your Prestige rating to the roll. On a success, the target surrenders or attempts to flee (Narrator’s discretion). On a failure, the target neither surrenders nor flees, but if your Prestige rating is higher than theirs, they have disadvantage on attacks that target you. This feature does not affect creatures with an Intelligence score of less than 3, without self-awareness (such as certain constructs), or that are immune to psychic damage.

###### Soulknife

The soulknife uses psionics as a way to bridge the gaps between the mental, the physical, and the spiritual natures of the self. When you walk this path, you intuit

ways to cut through the psychic walls people build around themselves and discover ways to leverage this vulnerability in yourself and others.

Soulknives are able to manifest psychic daggers, which are their weapon of choice.

Psychic Daggers

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level you gain the ability to use a bonus action to manifest up to two psychic daggers which require concentration to maintain. These psychic daggers deal 2d4 psychic damage, have the thrown (10/30) and dual-wielding properties, and you are proficient in their use. You use your Wisdom modifier for attack and damage rolls made with them. When wielding two psychic daggers, you can make a melee or ranged attack with the psychic dagger in your

off-hand as a bonus action, including as part of the bonus action used to manifest your psychic daggers.

If you throw a psychic dagger, it reappears in your hand immediately after it hits or misses your target. The psychic daggers remain until you lose concentration.

Hidden Thoughts

Also at 3rd level, you control your emotional expressions and Insight checks made against you suffer disadvantage.

Agile Psionics

At 6th level, you gain proficiency with the Mist and Shade combat tradition and learn the Deceptive Stance which does not count against your number of maneuvers known.

Piercing Soul

Beginning at 9th level, once between rests when you hit a creature with a psychic dagger attack, you can use your reaction to

strike directly at the creature’s psyche instead of dealing damage. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your psionics save DC, suffering your choice of one of the following conditions until the end of your next turn on a failure: confused, frightened (with you as the source of their fear), rattled, or slowed. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Twist of Fate

At 14th level you have learned to pair your mental and physical prowess to achieve your goals. Choose one sentient creature within melee or ranged distance. As an action you can make a Sleight of Hand check against the target’s passive Perception. On a failure, your attempt misses, but the target remains unaware of the attempt. On a success, you hit the target with your psychic dagger. Instead of damage, you instead manifest one of the following effects:

**Critical Coma.** You hit and deal damage with both of your psychic daggers. If the target survives and the damage done is equal to or greater than the target’s Wisdom score, it falls asleep. Otherwise, it is rattled until the beginning of its next turn. Slumbering creatures stay asleep for 1 minute unless it takes damage or someone uses an action to physically wake it.

**Falsified Memory.** You implant one false memory into the target’s mind. The target believes this memory to be true for 1d6 days unless its memory is psychically restored. During this time, they suffer the bewildered short-term mental stress effect. After completing a long rest at a haven, the target can make an Intelligence saving throw against your psionics save DC to remove the bewildered effect early and recognize the memory as false.

**Profound Fear.** The target develops an irrational fear of an item, creature, or sound of your choice. This fear counts

as the phobia long-term mental stress effect and lasts for 1d6 days or until it is relieved by psychic means, whichever comes first. After completing a long rest at a haven, the target can make an Wisdom saving throw against your psionics save DC to remove the phobia effect early.

**Stolen Secrets.** You delve into the target’s thoughts and discover secrets they would otherwise keep hidden. The target remains unaware that you accessed these thoughts for 1d6 days, after which time it remembers the intrusion and knows you are the source of the effect.

**Unfathomed Thoughts.** The target is stunned until the beginning of your next turn as it becomes lost in contemplation of all the deep mysteries of life.

###### Encyclopedic Knowledge

At 1st-level you gain an expertise die on all Science checks and for you expertise dice in the Science skill can be upgraded to d12, exceeding the usual limit on expertise dice. In addition to your personal wealth of information, you also know how to quickly scour digital databases to find whatever answer you might need. When you make a skill check related to scientific knowledge (such as those made to identify a lifeform, natural phenomenon, or technology) and you have access to a computer network, you can supplement your knowledge with the computer’s database as an action.

When you do, you treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

###### Scientist Archetype

Each scientist is inherently diverse in their own body of knowledge, yet among voidrunning scientists there are common career paths and skills. At 1st level, you choose a scientific archetype. This choice represents your specialized skill base, including how you combine scientific knowledge and the social world around you. Your archetype grants you features at 1st level and again at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

###### Praxes

At 1st level, you have a particular means of putting your theories into practice as you discover new theories or build new inventions. Your praxes options are detailed at the end of the class description. When

you gain scientist levels, you gain additional praxes of your choice, as shown in the “Praxes Known” column of the Scientist table. If you should gain bonus praxes, they do not count against your Praxes Known.

Intelligence is the ability for your scientific praxis features. You use your Intelligence whenever a praxis refers to your scientific ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a scientist feature and when making an attack roll using the Science skill.

**Praxis save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Praxis attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Tools of Science

Scientists use a wide variety of high-end technology and techniques to supplement both their research and their needs as voidrunners.

You access your praxes using your tools of science, such as a medical pouch, hacking tools, or engineer’s toolbox, which are defined by your archetype. You gain proficiency in those tools. Your tools also include expendable resources which can limit the frequency with which you use certain features. If you become separated from your gear, your praxes are ineffective or unable to be used. Your features are restored to normal once you retrieve or replace your tools.

###### Scrutinize

At 1st level, you can apply your deep cunning to analyze enemy weaknesses. You can use a bonus action to critically assess a target you can see within 30 feet (or in space combat, within firing range of your spacecraft). When you do, you learn of any vulnerabilities that creature has.

Additionally, you can identify a specific weakness and choose one damage

type. Damage of the chosen type dealt against the target increases by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus for 1 minute.

Your range for this feature increases by 30 feet at 6th, 11th, and 16th level. At 20th level your range is limited only by sight.

You have one use of this feature, gaining a second at 11th level. You regain all spent uses whenever you finish a short or long rest. Additionally, you may always use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity on attack and damage rolls.

###### Academic Standing

At 3rd level, you complete the final stages of your academic training. Choose one of the following features:

Doctor of Science

You have a degree (or the equivalent) from a prestigious university or other institution certifying that you have both mastered and advanced your academic field. You gain a title that reflects your erudition, such as "doctor" or a similar term from the culture that educated you. Presentation of your degree (such as on the wall in your office or a digital copy attached to your resume) may compel certain people of neutral disposition to better trust your discretion, judgment, and professional opinion. When it does, your prestige score counts as 1 rank higher.

Officer's Academy

You got your education by virtue of your proximity to a military force, where learning is not for its own sake but for the sake of the security of your people. You have a military rank and title (unless you have retired from service), potentially opening doors that would not be available to a civilian. You gain proficiency with Insight. You also gain an expertise die on opposed rolls against

Intimidation checks and saves made to resist fear effects.

Renegade Innovator

Creation and discovery are more important to you than anything else, such as law, decorum, and even your personal health. During a long rest, you can use tools for crafting instead of sleeping and still receive the full benefits of the long rest. Your raw demeanor resulting from your many sleepless nights grants you an expertise die on Intimidation checks.

###### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

###### Scientific Leadership

Starting at 7th level, your impact in the scientific field becomes undeniable. Choose one of the following.

Crew Efficiency

As a leader on your space vessel, the organization and discipline you promote among the crew helps ensure safety and camaraderie. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. Crew members of your capital ship have advantage on saving throws and checks against critical malfunctions.

Loyal Interns

Your unique genius inspires a cohort of interns who are dedicated to learning under you, and they are willing to put in the work for their on-the-job education. You gain the

service of an aspiring **scientist** or a number of **cadets** equal to your proficiency bonus. If one of these followers leaves your service, your mystique attracts replacements within one month.

Science Communicator

You regularly reach out to the public to share what you know, including recordings or transcripts of your lectures, reflections, and interviews. You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. Additionally, your Prestige score increases by 1 rank.

###### Scientific Achievement

At 9th level, you are granted a distinction from an important scientific group, political faction, or military force. Roll 1d6, choose, or work with the Narrator to determine the origin and nature of this distinction. As a recipient of that prize, your prestige score increases by 1, and you gain

1,000 credits.

Furthermore, choose a skill related to this achievement. You gain proficiency in that skill and an expertise die on checks made with it. For you, expertise dice in the chosen skill can be upgraded to d12, exceeding the usual limit on expertise dice.

Awarding Faction

1. The Fleet.
2. Scientific research organization.
3. Famous charity.
4. Social media icon or news outlet.
5. Religious organization.
6. Criminal organization.

Prize

1. Trophy of gold, platinum, or other precious substance.
2. Medal, insignia, or ribbon.
3. Portrait, bust, or statue.
4. 1,000 credits cash.
5. Honorary doctoral degree.
6. Honorary title of nobility.

###### Glimpse of Infinity

At 15th level, at the risk of sounding somewhat unscientific, your deep experiences in science grant you insights some might call "mystical"—and you put them to logical use. Choose one of the following.

Alien Resonance

When communicating with a creature with which you share neither a language nor a creature type, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against that creature.

Intuit Probability

Equations of chaos and cosmic probability stream constantly through your mind. Three times between long rests, you can assess the likely results of a specific course of action that you intend to take within the next 30 minutes. The Narrator chooses from the following:

* Favorable (good results likely)
* Unfavorable (bad results likely)
* Costly (both good and bad results likely)
* Inconsequential (results that aren’t especially good or bad)

This calculation does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome, such as making additional preparations.

Radical Interdisciplinarian

At your stage in learning, each new lesson informs the next, creating in you a cascading chain of expertise. You gain a number of additional skill specialties equal to your proficiency bonus, and an additional new specialty whenever your proficiency bonus increases.

###### Galactic Genius

At 20th level, your knowledge of the universe is unparalleled. You become proficient in all scientist class skills and you gain advantage whenever you use those skills. If you are already proficient in a skill, instead you gain a speciality in that skill.

Additionally you can apply your brilliance to any problem and use your Intelligence ability modifier whenever you would normally use a different ability score to make an ability check or saving throw.

##### Scientific Praxes

If a praxis has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the praxis at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your scientist level.

Items produced as a result of a scientific praxis are non-standard and cannot be sold or transferred to other creatures, and cease working in the hands of anybody other than yourself.

###### Anti-Surveillance Ward

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

Once between long rests, you can ward one Large or smaller target against detection by devices for 8 hours. This creature has advantage on Stealth checks made against Constructs, and does not trigger alarms. On

digital recordings and live streams, this creature is nearly invisible except for faint visual static of their general shape. Any noise they make is also replaced by static.

###### Applied Bioscience

*Prerequisite: 6th level*

You have a device that employs both radiation and nutrient-dense nanites to enable plants to grow at an unnatural speed. You can set the device to emit its payload immediately, or for a prolonged period for a long-term benefit.

You can use an action to cause all plants within 100 feet of a point you can see to grow suddenly. Vegetation in the area immediately becomes thick and overgrown. Every foot of movement a creature takes within this area costs 2 extra feet. Plant creatures instead gain temporary hit points equal to 3 × your scientist level.

Alternatively, you can monitor the device as it safely irradiates all plants in a half-mile radius over the course of 8 hours. The affected plants yield double their crop for 1 year.

You can use this praxis once between long rests.

###### Applied Pharmacology

You know what materials can be repurposed to quickly synthesize a wide variety of medicine, drugs, and other healthcare needs. Over the course of 1 minute, you can create one of the following items:

* antiseptic (1 use)
* Immune booster
* anti-g cocktail
* quicksober patch
* anti-inhibitive
* anti-rad
* anxiety medication
* ear plugs
* first aid kit (1 use)
* focusing agent
* reflex enhancer
* smelling salts
* steroid
* stimulant
* universal airhypo

At 4th level, you can also make nano-bandage, gullibility serum, truth serum, and styx. At 6th level, you can also make synthetic adrenaline.

Items produced in this way lose effectiveness after 1 hour. You can use this feature to create a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

###### Applied Social Sciences

You gain proficiency and an expertise die with two skills from the following: Culture, Deception, Intimidation, Insight, or Persuasion.

###### Acceleration Dampener

*Prerequisite: 8th level*

You have a vial of unguent which protectively reduces acceleration. Once between long rests as an action, you can apply it to a willing creature within reach. For 10 minutes, the target gains resistance to nonmagical and nonpsionic bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.

###### Chroniton Grenade

*Prerequisite: 6th level*

You have a chroniton grenade, whose explosion slows the flow of time in that area. You can use it once between long rests.

You can deploy the grenade as an action, throwing it up to 30 feet, after which it explodes in a 10 foot radius sphere.

Creatures and devices in the explosion radius make Constitution saving throws

against your Science save DC. On a successful saving throw, a target is rattled until the end of its next turn. On a failure, the target becomes slowed for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a slowed target repeats the saving throw to end the effect on it.

Alternatively, as an action you can cause the grenade to implode, increasing the flow of time for a single creature in your line of effect within 30 feet. For 1 minute, the target’s Speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains one additional action on each of its turns. This action can be used to make a single weapon attack, or to take the Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. Such an effect is taxing, however. At the end of the duration, the target can’t use movement or take actions until after its next turn.

###### Cloaking Device

*Prerequisite: 4th level*

Once between long rests, you can deploy an experimental device to hide a creature from view. As an action, you cloak one creature you touch with a fragile device, turning it invisible. Anything the target is carrying or wearing is invisible as long as it remains in the target’s possession. The device functions for 30 minutes, but malfunctions if the target attacks or uses a psionic power, ending the invisibility early.

###### Custom Blaster

You have a weapon you've personally crafted, an energy blaster. This weapon uses the same statistics as a blaster except its range is doubled, it does force damage, and it requires no ammunition. You are proficient with it while you wield it, and you can use your scientific ability for attack and damage rolls with it.

As a bonus action, you can change its damage type to be cold, fire, or lightning,

and you can change it back to force as another action.

###### Devise Contraption

You know how to quickly turn extraneous materials into high-tech marvels. As a bonus action, you can create one of the following items:

* chemical detector
* Geiger counter
* chemical light stick
* spray adhesive
* cryospray
* spray paint (1 use)
* duct tape (30 feet)
* zero-friction lubricant
* flashlightadhesive spray

Items produced in this way lose effectiveness after 1 hour. You can use this feature to create a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

###### Efficient Storage

You create a duffle bag or other similarly-sized container lined with

mysterious materials, bigger on the inside than on the outside, increasing its capacity without much affecting its size or weight.

This container can store 500 pounds or 10 cubic feet of material, and it never weighs more than 16 lbs.

This experimental container malfunctions after 1 hour of use by another creature. Replacing this item requires another container and 50 credits of materials.

###### Emergency Biome

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

You have one emergency biome, stored in a pressurized smart capsule nearly the size of

a coin. You can use it once between long rests, and preparing each use consumes 200 credits of materials.

Deploying the emergency biome capsule takes 1 minute. Once deployed, the capsule emits a 10-foot radius hemisphere of immobile protective force. Creatures you designate can pass through the dome, although external atmospheric conditions and radiation (other than visible light) do not. It is proofed for use against a hard vacuum. The capsule fills that hemisphere with the atmospheric conditions you designate (such as the air, temperature, and humidity of a pleasant day on your homeworld). This dome can fit up to 10 Medium creatures inside, provides shelter, and can be used as a safe haven. The dome is transparent from the inside, but it can’t be seen through from the outside and is the color of your choice. The interior is dimly lit, and you can turn the light off or on during your turn without using an action.

This device fails if more than 10 Medium creatures occupy it.

###### Energetic Shielding

*Prerequisite: 3rd level*

As part of a long rest, designate a number of spacecraft or devices equal to your proficiency modifier. You must spend at least an hour with these targets as part of the long rest. The designated targets gain resistance to a damage type you choose, which lasts for 24 hours.

At 11th level, your designated targets have advantage on saving throws against space hazards, saving throws against malfunctions, and checks related to navigation.

###### Energized Blaster

*Prerequisite: 5th level, Custom Blaster praxis*

You can attack with your Custom Blaster twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

###### Escape Beam

*Prerequisite: 11th level*

Once between long rests, as an action you can teleport yourself back to the deck of a spaceship you have crewed in the last 48 hours. You can bring up to 5 willing creatures within reach. The destination spaceship must be in the same star system as you.

###### Experimental Teleporter

*Prerequisite: 8th level*

Once between long rests, you can use an experimental teleportation device. You can use it as an action to teleport to any location you can visualize or designate within 500 feet. You can bring along another creature of your size or smaller, plus anything you two carry up to your carrying capacity. If you would arrive in an occupied space the effect fails, and you and any creature with you each take 4d6 force damage.

###### Extended Scan

When you use a multi-scanner, its range increases to 30 feet.

At 5th level, its range increases to 50 feet, and at 10th level it increases to 100 feet.

###### Fabrication Device

*Prerequisite: 7th level*

As long as you have access to a science bay or field laboratory, once between long rests you can spend one hour to create any item worth 50 credits or less.

At 11th level, you can also fabricate healthy meals. Once between long rests,

you can fabricate a number of Supply equal to twice your proficiency modifier.

At 15th level, a creature who consumes one of these Supply as part of their long rest during the next 6 hours has the following benefits, which last for 24 hours:

* Advantage on Constitution saving throws.
* Resistance against damage from poison, disease, and radiation.
* The creature's hit point maximum increases by 2d10.

###### Financial Exploit

*Prerequisite: 13th level*

Your finances are organized to exploit the same economic loopholes as used by the ultra wealthy. Each week, a large sum of money is credited to one of your digital wallets accessible through your devices.

This sum varies depending on your scientist level. Add your scientist level to your Intelligence modifier and multiply the total by the amount shown in Table: Financial Exploit. For example, if you are 14th level, and have an Intelligence modifier of +2, you would multiply 100 credits by 16, earning 1,600 credits per week.

TABLE: FINANCIAL EXPLOIT LEVEL MULTIPLIER

13th 100 credits

17th 1,000 credits

Whenever the total wealth you have amassed using this feature exceeds 50,000 credits, market fluctuations wipe it out, resetting the total to zero unless you have already spent it.

###### Flight Plan

*Prerequisite: 15th level*

You have a semi-automated starfighter that tracks your location from orbit. You may select any starfighter that costs 1,200

credits or less for this feature. Once between long rests you can command the on-board AI to extract you from a location you designate within 5 miles of your current location. The starfighter arrives as soon as it can, usually in about 30 minutes. Repairing or rebuilding your spacecraft takes the same amount of time as normal, but at no cost to you.

###### Geographic Spectrometer

*Prerequisite: 3rd level*

Once between long rests, you can deploy a satellite spectrometer to get a readout of your local area, up to a 5 mile radius. The satellite sends to your devices a topographical map of your area, as well as a spectrometer analysis of the area, detailing near surface-level deposits of valuable resources (water, minerals, gasses, etc.).

At 11th level, the area scanned is a 50 mile radius and includes information on major lifeforms in the area, as well as mineral deposits up to 5 miles beneath the surface. At 19th level, this effect scans the entire planet you're on, and includes information on key civilizations and landmarks.

###### Grenade Enthusiast

To you, all voidrunners should know about the hazardous materials common to their trade—and their reaction to open flame.

Over the course of 1 minute, you can use this feature to create one grenade, mine, or remote detonator. Items produced in this way lose effectiveness after 1 hour.

You can use this feature to create a number of items equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

###### Jet Pack

*Prerequisite: 10th level*

You develop or obtain a standard jetpack. If it is lost or stolen, it malfunctions within 24 hours and turns to useless scrap. You are able to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged jetpack using raw materials whenever you finish a long rest.

###### Interplanetary Mutagen

*Prerequisite: 4th level*

You have a dose of mutagen, which you can further modify on the spot to help your fellow voidrunners. Once between long rests, you can inject the mutagen as an action to a willing creature of the humanoid or beast type within reach, causing one of the following effects for 30 minutes:

* **Amphibian.** The target can breathe underwater normally and gains a swimming speed equal to its base Speed.
* **Atmospheric Adaptation.** The target becomes adapted to the present environmental conditions (temperature, atmospheric composition, pressure, etc.) To use this option, there must be a humanoid or beast naturally adapted to this environment (such as a native to that planet or biome) within your reach.
* **Natural Weapons.** The target grows a biologically enhanced natural weapon, such as claws or teeth, with a +1 bonus to attack and damage. Its unarmed strikes with that natural weapon deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate.
* **Sturdy Hide.** The target's AC increases by your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). To use this
* option, you must be 8th level or higher.
* **Wings.** The target gains a fly speed equal to its base Speed. To use this option, you must be 10th level or higher.

###### Lab Assistant

*Prerequisite: 9th level*

You gain the service of a follower chosen from the following: engineer, medic, scientist, or hacker. If you lose this follower, you can replace them through this feature at 50% cost.

###### Main Engine Innovator

*Prerequisite: 13th level*

As part of a long rest, you can tune up one spacecraft you have access to. For the next 24 hours, the ship's impulse speed improves by one category, and if it is capable of FTL travel it’s FTL speed is improved by 2.

###### Makeshift Forcefield

You have a small reserve of imperfect but useful forcefield projector devices. You have a number of these projectors equal to your proficiency bonus, and you replace any used ones when you complete a long rest. You can use a makeshift forcefield in one of two ways:

* As an action, you can deploy a projector on yourself or a creature within reach. The projector has 5 hit points and remains deployed for 1 minute. When the target takes damage, the projector absorbs up to 5 points of damage, and is destroyed once its hit points are depleted. At the start of the target's turn, if the projector has any hit points remaining it is restored to 5 hit points.
* As a reaction when you are subject to an attack, you can deploy a projector to deflect sudden harm. Attacks (including the triggering attack) against you are made with disadvantage that lasts until the end of your next turn.

###### Mimic Nanites

*Prerequisite: 10th level*

You have control over a nanite swarm crafted from exotic matter. Once between long rests as an action, you can command the mimic nanites to take the form of a physical object no larger than a 5 foot cube, and with a value no more than 1,000 cr. You also direct the material for the nanites to mimic, which determines the duration of the effect.

TABLE: MIMIC NANITES MATERIAL DURATION

Vegetable matter 1 day Stone or crystal 12 hours

Precious metals 1 hour

Gems 10 minutes

Exotic matter 1 minute

###### Modify Armor

You gain proficiency with weapons and armor maintenance tools, or an expertise die with them if you are already proficient. Once between long rests, you can spend one hour to apply coating to a set of armor or to recoat it (See Chapter 3: Equipment).

Starting at 4th level, you create auxiliary armor mods designed for adaptability and ease of use. You have a total number of auxiliary armor mods equal to your proficiency modifier, and as part of a short or long rest you can install or uninstall any of them on armor you touch. An installed auxiliary armor mod malfunctions and dislodges itself from the mod port after 24 hours unless you perform maintenance on it as part of a long rest. The mods available are limited by your scientist level, as shown below.

LEVEL AVAILABLE MODS

4 Biosensors, advanced cold shielding,

+ drone port (sans drone), first aid kit,

+

###### Modify Weaponry

You gain proficiency with weapons and armor maintenance tools, or an expertise die with them if you are already proficient. Once between long rests, you can spend one hour to retrofit a weapon, permanently adding or replacing a weapon augment (See Chapter 3: Equipment). Once a weapon has a number of augments equal to your proficiency bonus, you can add no more to it.

Starting at 4th level, once between long rests, you can spend 1 minute to improve 10 pieces of unattended firearm or spacefighter ammunition. That ammunition gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and you can change the damage type dealt with that ammunition to any type. This benefit ends after 24 hours.

At 8th level, your modified ammunition improves to a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. At 12th level, your modified ammunition improves to a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

###### Multimodal Analysis

Your insight is good on its own, and with the help of high-end computers, few mysteries are outside your reach. You gain proficiency

with Investigation. When you make a skill check to examine materials, samples, or other forms of evidence in a field laboratory or a science bay, you treat a d20 roll of 14 or lower as a 15.

At 9th level, you automatically learn any cultural or mythological information related to materials you examine in a field laboratory or science bay, as well as the basic functioning of most technology.

Analysis of extremely esoteric technology may yield incomplete or encrypted information.

###### Orbital Artillery

*Prerequisite: 14th level*

You enjoy cover fire provided by an ally in orbit, such as a satellite station directing hijacked asteroids or a ship's main gun.

Your artillery has 4 shots, which recharge when you complete a long rest. As an action, you can launch up to all remaining shots, directing the target square for each within 120 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of a target square makes a Dexterity saving throw against your science save DC, taking 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in more than one area of effect is only affected by one impact.

At 16th level, the damage improves to 10d6 fire and 10d6 bludgeoning. Each shot produces a 20-foot radius sphere.

At 18th level, the damage improves to 14d6 fire and 14d6 bludgeoning. Each shot produces a 40-foot radius sphere and your range increases to 1 mile (or in space combat, within the same star system).

###### Portal Gun

*Prerequisite: 15th level*

You develop a gateway projection device (See Chapter 3: Equipment). If it is lost or stolen, it malfunctions within 24 hours and turns to useless scrap.

**Recharge**

*Prerequisite: 18th level*

Once between long rests, you can use this praxis to regain one use of an expended praxis.

###### Remote Comms

Once between long rests, you can spend 1 minute to create a distress beacon.

Also, while you have access to your tools of science, you can spend 1 hour establishing a remote comms station. The remote comms station is a Tiny-sized device that targets one location you know in the same star system, such as a planetary capital, lunar base, or known spacecraft.

Distress beacons and other devices within 10 feet of your remote comms station can communicate with the target's reception devices, even if communications are otherwise lost or backed out.

###### Resilient Forcefield

*Prerequisite: 8th level*

Once between long rests, you can use an action to project a spherical forcefield around a target within 30 feet (or in space combat, within 1 combat zone). Unwilling or enemy targets can make a Dexterity saving throw against your Science save DC to negate the effect.

The forcefield lasts for 1 minute, during which time the target's speed is halved. The forcefield can be destroyed without harming anyone inside by being dealt at least 15 force damage at once. It can also be hacked. Other attacks and effects do not pass in or out. The forcefield is immune to all damage besides force, it is proofed against hard vacuum, and atmospheric effects do not enter.

###### Spatial Instability Beacon

*Prerequisite: 6th level*

You have a curious badge infused with exotic matter, which allows you to slip through the cracks in space-time. As a bonus action, you can use this item to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. You can use this item a number of times between long rests equal to your proficiency bonus. Its enigmatic qualities prevent it from being lost or stolen.

###### Spectral Storage

*Prerequisite: 7th level*

You have a storage crate with a volume of 12 cubic feet wedged in a convenient extradimensional space. You can bring forth your spectral crate as an action in an unoccupied space within reach. You can safely store the crate back in extradimensional space when you touch it as an action.

###### Surveillance Drone

*Prerequisite: 7th level, Utility Drone Helper praxis*

Your **utility drone** is proficient in Stealth. Once between long rests when you deploy your handy drone, you can activate a cloaking function. When deployed in this way, it gains temporary hit points equal to your scientist level + your Intelligence modifier. This invisibility lasts for 1 hour, and ends early if the drone attacks or if it runs out of temporary hit points.

###### Surveillance Technician

*Prerequisite: 3rd level*

You know how to support intelligence operations with just-in-time inventions. Once between short or long rests, you can create one of the following items over the course of 1 minute:

* Binocular
* Bug detector
* Gas mask
* Grapple gun
* Hacking tools
* Handcuffs
* Nightvision goggles
* Portable x-ray scanner
* Range earmuffs
* Signal jammer
* Tracer

Items produced in this way lose effectiveness after 5 hours.

###### Truth Serum

This injectable serum unlocks and untethers the mind. A creature makes a Constitution saving throw against your Science save DC when it is subjected to the serum, and on a failure it becomes poisoned. While poisoned in this way a creature cannot knowingly lie.

Form a countdown dice pool equal to your proficiency bonus. Each time the target is forced to answer a question truthfully, roll the countdown dice pool and remove any dice which result in a 6. When the pool is depleted, the truth serum wears off. If the pool is not depleted, the serum wears off after 10 minutes.

A target who has been affected by truth serum cannot be affected again until after they have finished a long rest.

###### Universal Translator

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

One of your devices is synched to a galactic language database, giving you access to over 1 million forms of aural and visual language. The device translates most any language you could see or hear into the spoken or written language of your choosing, such as your mother tongue. As a bonus action, the device can coach you on how to say, write, or sign your desired message in another language. The device works on most languages, but hidden or secret languages cannot be translated.

You can also let another creature borrow the device and tweak its language preferences as an action for up to 1 hour. If this device is lost or stolen, it de-syncs from the translation server.

###### Utility Drone Helper

You have the service of a **utility drone**, a robot you command with voice control or through one of your devices. Your drone normally hides amidst your gear, but you can deploy it as an action. In combat it takes its turn immediately after you. It follows your verbal directions with no action required, but commanding it to attack uses your action and its reaction.

Repairing your drone is free if you have access to its remains and your tools of science over the course of a long rest.

Otherwise, the materials to replace your drone cost 25 credits. If its signal is ever jammed, your drone does its best to return to your last known location.

##### Scientist Archetypes

Science touches every facet of space travel, and voidrunning scientists enjoy deploying a wide variety of technology on their missions. That said, there are certain roles desired for scientists to be able to fulfill on space voyages. A scientist may deeply identify with the archetype they choose, or they might only present as a member of that role while on a space adventure.

Engineer

Engineers are builders, inventors, technicians, and machinists of every stripe. They live to create (and destroy) with their own hands. Military organizations often deploy their engineers with strike crews to build forward operation camps, and many voidrunner crews would be lost without the expertise of whoever runs their ship's engines. Other engineers might represent

homegrown inventors, cybernetic implant enthusiasts, and space colonists hardened by severe living conditions.

Metallurgist's Mettle

At 1st level, you are more hardy and tenacious than the average scientist. Your scientist hit points change to the following:

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per scientist level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per scientist level after 1st

You also gain the following proficiencies and features:

* You gain proficiency in medium armor and three martial weapons of your choice
* You gain proficiency in Engineering and an expertise die on all Engineering checks
* You gain an expertise die on checks using an engineer's toolbox.
* Expertise dice on Engineering checks and your chosen tool can be upgraded from d8 to d12, exceeding the usual limit on expertise dice.

Tools of Science

Additionally at 1st level you gain an engineer’s toolbox which is your tool of science.

Analytical Attack

Also at 1st level you can use an action to make an attack against a creature with the construct type. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against you maneuver DC or gain your choice of the blinded, deafened, or slowed condition until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, you

can choose to inflict the charmed, confused, or restrained condition, but the target makes its saving throw with advantage.

Miracle Worker

At 2nd level, if you can fix it, you can fix it with your engineer’s toolbox. You can use an engineer’s toolbox in lieu of any tool with which you're proficient for the purposes of making repairs, and using it in this way does not incur the normal penalties.

You can also undertake repairs at breakneck speed. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to use a tool you are proficient with in a way that normally requires an action. When you spend 1 minute or longer to craft, repair, or dismantle an item or vehicle using one of your proficient tools, the total time it takes you is reduced by half.

Field Deployment

At 6th level, you can prepare a little something special for your adventures. Choose one of the following options.

**Deploy Automaton.** Once between long rests, when you have access to your gear, you can spend 1 minute to deploy an automaton of a variety of your choice (Chapter 8: Alien Bestiary). Your automaton appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. It is active for 1 minute, after which it returns to sleep mode and stores itself in your gear. Whenever you finish a long rest, any hit points lost by your automaton are restored. While active, its AI is limited, and unless directed it uses its turn to take the Dodge action.

You can command the automaton using voice control or one of your devices with no action required, which it follows to the best of its ability until the task is

completed or you issue a new command. Any saving throws caused by your automaton utilize your science save DC and your automaton gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your automaton is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one over the course of a long rest with 50 credits worth of replacement parts.

**Hot-Swap.** Once between long rests you can spend one minute to make adjustments to an energy weapon using your engineer’s toolbox. Select a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, thunder. The weapon’s damage type changes to that damage type for 1 hour.

After 1 hour, the weapon breaks and cannot be used until you have completed a long rest.

Emergency Fortifications

At 10th level, using your engineer’s toolbox, you can provide additional protection for you and your allies. Choose one of the following options:

**Carbon Lattice.** You have a small army of nanites which can produce walls of carbon fiber lattice in moments. You can command your nanites as an action to instantly build a wall in an area you designate within 120 feet. Between long rests, your nanites can produce a total of up to 100 feet of carbon fiber lattice. Each

10-foot section of lattice is 6 inches thick, has 15 AC and 100 hit points. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it. The carbon fiber lattice is not proofed for use against a hard vacuum.

**Personal Shielding.** You can create a temporary personal forcefield. Spend one minute and choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, force, lightning,

radiant, thunder. A number of creatures of your choice up to your proficiency bonus within 60 feet gains resistance against that damage type for one hour.

Prototype Armor

At 14th level, you've pieced together a prototype for the next revolution in personal protective gear. You gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also have a set of prototype armor, which you have pieced together bit by bit over your adventures.

Prototype armor has the statistics shown in Table: Prototype Armor.

Only you are proficient with this armor. If it lost, you can reconstruct a new set during a long rest, consuming 450 credits of materials.

**Table: Prototype Armor Type:** Prototype Armor **Cost:** —

**Weight:** 90 lbs.

**AC:** 18

**Material Properties:** Spacefaring (8 mod ports), Strength

**Strength Requirement:** — **Stealth Penalty:** — **Repairability:** DC 15 tinker’s tools

**Strength.** This armor grants you advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.

###### Expert

Experts are highly prized scientists whose unique expertise make them singular educators, researchers, and consultants. Experts are renowned for their knowledge, and each expert understands not only the cutting-edge of their field, but also possesses a broad education touching on many areas of science. Their endless study might dialogue two disparate fields of knowledge, or they might center on the universe's deepest questions. Experts frequently serve as science officers, using

their breadth of knowledge to advise the ship administrators and devise action plans during emergencies or encounters with the unknown.

Expertise

At 1st level, you are extraordinarily versed in the sciences, both generally and in your field of specialty. You gain the following features:

* You gain proficiency in one additional scientist class skill in which you are not already proficient.
* Additionally, you learn one additional Science skill specialty..

Tools of Science

Additionally at 1st level you gain a

multi-scanner which is your tool of science.

Proactive Advice

At 2nd level, you are more quick and efficient in offering relevant advice. You can use Scrutinize twice between short or long rests. At 11th level, you can do so a total of 4 times.

Additionally, you gain an additional speciality in a scientist class skill in which you are proficient.

Evasive Protocol

At 6th level, your assessment of enemy weaknesses includes strategy for avoiding dangers. When a creature deals the bonus damage against your Scrutinize target, that creature gains advantage on the next saving throw it makes before the start of its next turn.

Additionally, you become proficient in one scientist class skill in which you are not already proficient.

Assess Formidability

At 10th level, you become unusually proficient at detecting whether you are outmatched. When you use Scrutiny, you learn that target's resistances, damage immunities, and condition immunities. You also learn the target's challenge rating, hit point maximum and current hit point total.

Additionally, you gain an additional speciality in a scientist class skill in which you are proficient.

Critical Discovery

At 14th level, you impress upon your allies the value of being open to the unknown, which makes them all the more dangerous. When your allies attack the target of your Scrutinize feature, their critical hit range increases by 1 (to a maximum of 17–20).

###### Hacker

Hackers are scientists whose lifeblood is the digital world, be they data scientists, security programmers, viral content creators, or those who hijack their platforms. Creation, destruction, security, exploitation—these motifs fill the mind of a hacker, whose vocation involves the navigation of complex networks filled with anonymous actors. The psychology of anonymity leads many hackers to believe they are above the law, yet some hackers also serve major institutions to protect them—though whether these "white hat" hackers are loyal to the institution is another matter.

Digital Wolf

At 1st level, your computer becomes an extension of your very self-and your hacking tools all the more. You gain proficiency with computers and hacking tools and an expertise die on all computers or hacking

tools checks. For you, expertise dice on computers checks and checks with hacking tools can be upgraded from d8 to d12, exceeding the usual limit on expertise dice.

Tools of Science

Additionally at 1st level you gain a hacking kit which is your tool of science.

Inner Reserve

At 2nd level, your hacking endurance leads you to bigger and better exploits. When you perform a hacking maneuver (see Chapter 4: Hacking), the hacking countdown pool is increased in size by your proficiency modifier. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you finish a long or short rest.

All-Access

At 6th level, you can operate most any computer system with greater ease than even its administrators. You do not have disadvantage on hacking checks made using connections other than a direct connection.

Additionally, you can initiate hacking a device as a bonus action and hacking maneuvers use a bonus action instead of an action.

Brute Force Exploit

At 10th level, your overclocked gear simply overpowers your digital opponents. You make contested hacking checks with advantage.

Electronic Wizard

At 14th level, your automated hacks make you an army of one. Your hacking countdown pool bonus dice are now equal to twice your proficiency modifier. Hacking maneuvers for you are your choice of

actions or bonus actions, and you can do both in a single turn without spending an additional countdown die.

Additionally, you can hack multiple systems simultaneously. Each system you hack simultaneously uses the same combined hacking countdown pool. When the pool is empty, your over-exerted gear is unable to cloak itself and you are locked out of all the networks you hacked simultaneously.

###### Inventor

Some scientists work outside the mainstream, devising new and innovative applications of technology. Often, these scientists are looked down upon by the scientific community and viewed as scoundrel at best, and as fools at worst. However, it is often only commercial success which separates such outsiders from those lauded and admired by their fellows.

I Made This

At 1st level, you gain an additional scientific praxis. Additionally, your Science save DC increases by 1.

Tools of Science

Additionally at 1st level you gain an engineer’s toolbox which is your tool of science.

Analytical Attack

Also at 1st level you can use an action to make an attack against a creature with your choice of the construct, ooze, or plant type (chosen when you first gain this feature).

The target must make a Constitution saving throw against you maneuver DC or gain your choice of the blinded, deafened, or slowed condition until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to inflict

the charmed, confused, or restrained condition, but the target makes its saving throw with advantage.

Scientific Breakthrough

At 2nd level, you start to uncover scientific secrets not known to your peers. Choose from one of the following options:

*Augmentation.* You gain +1 to one of your ability scores, to a maximum of 20.

*Cybernetics.* You gain one cybernetic enhancement implant. *Medicine.* You develop an immediate cure for one malady.

*Time Travel.* You begin to understand the basic tenets of time travel. You can use an action to activate a device which can pause time until the end of your next turn for everybody within 30 feet except you. Those within the zone are unable to act and cannot perceive the passage of time. Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

Continued Research

At 6th level, you gain an additional scientific praxis.

Advanced Breakthrough

At 10th level, the scientific breakthrough you chose at 2nd level improves as you continue to unlock new and exciting science.

*Augmentation.* You gain an additional +1 to one of your ability scores, to a maximum of 22.

*Cybernetics.* You are no longer limited by your proficiency bonus when determining how many cyberware devices you may use.

*Medicine.* You develop an immediate cure for all maladies.

*Time Travel.* Your time travel device allows you to travel back in time and prepare for all eventualities. You may retroactively do one thing you might feasibly have done in the last 24 hours which would have taken no longer than 5 minutes. The Narrator will determine whether or not the action you choose is feasible.

Incredible Discovery

At 14th level, you make the most incredible discovery of your career and invent a mysterious device which is your gateway to the universe. This device looks however you like (although the Narrator might have a particular artifact in mind for you to use), and uses nearly inconceivable technology like temporospatial tesseract folding or quantum improbability. The device cannot be operated by anybody other than you.

By spending 10 minutes, you can use this device to open a portal in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. The portal takes up a Medium-sized space, but its actual dimensions are indeterminate. It leads to any other point in the universe you designate (even locations you only know by description) and remains open for up to one hour.

The device is not 100% reliable, and while you can choose your destination, you are only guaranteed to arrive near the target at a location chosen by the Narrator.

At the Narrator’s discretion, at 20th level your device improves further and your portal can traverse not just the universe but the whole multiverse and even different time periods. The planes of existence, eras, timelines, and transcendent states available are up to the sole discretion of the Narrator.

Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

###### Medic

Any number of healthcare-facing scientists might be called medics, including high-tech field doctors, medical researchers, and directors of medicine and personnel health. Most medics are oathbound to preserve life and uphold quality of life to the best of their ability. Invariably, the medic's field of deployment, cultural upbringing, and species impact how they interpret and fulfill this oath. Then there are medics who misinterpret or renege their oath, whose hatred for life or love of power drive them to commit unspeakable atrocities in the name of "research" and "progress." As voidrunners, medics are known for their efficient use of medical supplies and their ability to promote both survival and

long-term health, even on alien worlds.

Medical Training

At 1st level, your medical training helps you save lives and promote health. You gain proficiency with the Medicine skill, and you gain an expertise die on Medicine checks. For you, expertise dice on Medicine checks can be upgraded from d8 to d12, exceeding the usual limit on expertise dice.

Also, whenever you stabilize a creature, and whenever you use an item to remove poison, disease, or ongoing damage from a creature, that creature regains hit points equal to your proficiency modifier.

Tools of Science

Additionally at 1st level you gain a medical pouch which is your tool of science.

Analytical Attack

Also at 1st level you can use an action to make an attack against a creature with your choice of the construct, ooze, or plant type

(chosen when you first gain this feature). The target must make a Constitution saving throw against you maneuver DC or gain your choice of the blinded, deafened, or slowed condition until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, you can choose to inflict the charmed, confused, or restrained condition, but the target makes its saving throw with advantage.

Emergency Medic

At 1st level you can use a medical pouch (See Chapter 3: Equipment) to spend an action to restore hit points to a creature within reach. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your proficiency modifier, regaining any spent uses when you complete a long rest. When you use this feature on a humanoid or beast within reach as an action, the creature regains 2d6 hit points.

At 6th level, the creature regains 4d6 hit points, at 12th level it regains 6d6 hit points, and at 18th level it regains 8d6 hit points.

Fortify Ally

At 2nd level, you are able to use your medical pouch to prepare yourself or an ally against potential environmental harm.

Spend one action to inject yourself or a humanoid or beast within reach. You can use this feature a number times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all spent uses whenever you finish a long rest.

A creature who benefits from this fortification has advantage on saving throws made to resist poison, disease, and radiation for the next hour.

Designated Patients

At 6th level, your long-term care of your closest allies keeps their health and energy high. When you take a long rest, choose up to 6 non-hostile creatures you meet during this rest to be your designated patients. A

chosen creature remains your designated patient until it completes two long rests.

Your designated patients each gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist disease, fatigue, and strife.

For each month a creature remains one of your designated patients, they receive one of the following benefits:

* The creature is cured of one short-term mental stress effect.
* The creature’s long-term mental stress effect is suppressed as long as it remains a designated patient.
* The creature regains a number of lost ability score points equal to your proficiency modifier.
* The creature regenerates a lost limb or organ.

Medical Requisition

At 10th level, you are able to secure

high-end medical equipment at a reduced price, such as convincing vendors to sell at cost, supplying through unregulated channels, or leveraging your reputation. You buy medical equipment (drugs, injury treatments, etc.) at a 50% discount.

Equipment you buy in this way is not eligible for resale on regulated markets.

Regenerative Nanites

At 14th level, you've developed or obtained a swarm of high end experimental medical nanites. Once between long rests, you can direct the nanites to a creature within reach, a process that takes 1 minute. The target immediately regains 4d8 + 15 hit points and regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points per minute) for 1 hour. If the target is missing any body parts, they are restored after 2 minutes and any severed body part can be instantly reattached. This does not allow a creature to attach a severed body part from another creature.

###### Dastardly Gambit

At 1st level, you have an infuriating ability to distract, goad, or otherwise throw your opponents off their game at just the right moment. This takes the form of a Dastardly Gambit die, a d6. When a creature that can hear or see you or a device you are piloting makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend a use of Dastardly Gambit, rolling a Dastardly Gambit die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll.

You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll. You have a number of Dastardly Gambit dice equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one). You regain any expended Dastardly Gambit dice when you finish a long rest.

At 5th level your Dastardly Gambit die increases to a d8, at 10th level it increases to a d10, and at 15th level it increases to a d12.

###### Fortunate Defense

Your ability to survive deadly encounters through sly maneuvering or dumb luck is extraordinary. At 1st level, choose one of the following options.

Artful Defense

While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

Sly Defense

While you are wearing light armor, you replace your Dexterity modifier with your Charisma modifier for AC.

###### Clever Tricks

At 1st level, your ability to befuddle and outplay your opponents has risen to an art form. You learn one clever trick of your choice. Your clever tricks are detailed at the end of the class description. The Clever Tricks column of the Scout table shows when you learn more clever tricks. Some clever tricks have requirements, such as minimum scout level, class feature, or another trick. You must meet those requirements before you choose that trick. If you should learn a bonus trick, it does not count against your clever tricks known.

Some of your clever tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Clever tricks save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

###### Combat Maneuvers

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in one combat tradition from the following list: Ace Starfighter, Biting Zephyr, Mist and Shade, or Rapid Current. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from tradition you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of the Scout table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree

column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

###### Dirty Fighting

At 2nd level you learn the subtle art of fighting dirty. You gain the following benefits:

* You gain proficiency with improvised weapons.
* You can attempt to confuse, trick, or otherwise distract a creature that can see or hear you as a bonus action. The target makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks DC or is tricked, giving the next attack against it advantage. Once you have used this feature against a creature it is immune to this feature’s effects for the next 24 hours.
* You can attempt the Disarm basic maneuver as a bonus action. Disarm basic maneuvers made in this way use your clever tricks DC instead of your Maneuver DC. You may use the Disarm maneuver with a ranged weapon as ong as your target is within 30 feet.
* You can use a bonus action to take the Dash action.

###### Reliable Flimflam

Also at 2nd level, you figure an approach that works for you—a practiced smile, a dependable bluff, or a tried and true lie. Choose Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion. You gain an expertise die in the chosen skill.

###### Scout Archetype

At 3rd level, choose one scout archetype. Though you are familiar with all sorts of tricks and grifts, your archetype represents your most practiced techniques and styles. You gain benefits from your archetype at 3rd level, and further features at 6th and 14th level.

###### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

###### Extra Attack

At 6th level you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

###### Font of Falsehood

Starting at 5th level, you regain all expended Dastardly Gambit dice whenever you finish a short rest.

###### Twisted Thinking

Beginning at 7th level, your mind is so used to double-think and twisted schemes that those that try to invade it find a resilient mental labyrinth. You gain an expertise die on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

###### Lucky Devil

Starting at 9th level, things have a way of working out for you. Whenever you roll a d20 for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you may immediately roll again and take the new result. You may wait until after a die is rolled before deciding to use this ability, but you must decide before the Narrator says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

You gain an additional use of this feature at 13th level and a third use starting at 17th level. You regain all spent uses of this feature whenever you finish a short rest.

###### Fake It Until You Make It

At 10th level, you can bluff your way through practically anything by projecting confidence, educated guessing, and sharing a few memorized talking points. You can always choose to use

Charisma when making an ability check using a skill or tool you aren’t proficient with.

###### Shift Approach

Beginning at 11th level, you’ve had enough experiences with your gambits going badly that you know the signs and how to quickly shift your approach. Whenever you roll the Dastardly Gambit die and the result is a 1 or 2, you may immediately reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.

###### Sheer Audacity

Starting at 18th level, your dastardly gambits have gotten so bold and so ridiculous that your enemies are often left completely stunned at your sheer audacity. Whenever you use Dastardly Gambit to reduce a creature’s roll it makes a Wisdom saving throw against your clever tricks save

DC. On a failed save the creature is stunned until the beginning of its next turn or until it takes damage. Once a creature makes a successful save against this feature it is immune to your Sheer Audacity for the next 24 hours.

###### Master Plan

At 20th level you’ve developed mind games within mind games and your plans run deep. You may spend a point of inspiration to reveal your master plan as an action. When your master plan is revealed, describe a theoretically possible sequence of events that has led to a suddenly revealed boon for you and your allies, however implausible.

Some examples include:

* An underling working for the villain was actually your friend working undercover this entire time.
* That the important item the enemy just got away with was actually a fake, only to reveal the real item.
* That a character was actually a different character in disguise, only to reveal the real character.

This feature is highly subject to the Narrator’s discretion, and you should discuss your master plan with the Narrator before activating this feature and revealing it. Your story can be implausible but not impossible, and you must fully explain a reasonable rationale for how such a con was possible in your reveal. Once the Narrator approves of your changes and you reveal your master plan, your story becomes reality, potentially even retroactively changing events. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you spend at least a week resting in a safe haven to plan out your next master plan.

###### Clever Tricks

If a clever trick has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the art at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your scout level.

###### Aggressive Retreat

*Requirement: 9th level*

Sometimes the best offense is saving your own skin while returning fire. Whenever you take the Disengage action, Sprint action, or make the Evasive Maneuvers starfighter maneuver, you may also make a single ranged attack as a part of that action.

###### Back Channel Gear

While in a city, spaceport, or any area with access to backchannel markets, you can use your contacts to acquire weapons or any item from the Security, Clothing, or Survival Gear tables at half the normal cost. If you publicly utilize or attempt to resell items acquired in this way, at the Narrator’s discretion you may attract the attention of local law enforcement.

###### Beast Tricks

When it comes down to it, trapping a beast isn’t that much different from fleecing a mark. You gain proficiency in Animal Handling. In addition, you can always choose to use Charisma when making Animal Handling checks, and when making Survival checks for hunting or the Hunt and Gather journey activity.

###### Buddy Hijinks

Your options open up when you have a friend or a willing patsy. Whenever you are back to back with an ally and either you or your ally is targeted by an attack, you can

choose to swap the target between you or your ally.

###### Bully

You can really get an edge in situations where you’re able to gang up on one target. While you are flanking a target, you can use a bonus action to attempt to bully and distract it. The target makes a Charisma saving throw or one creature of your choice also flanking the target may make an attack of opportunity against it.

###### Card Shark

Games of chance are your method of choice for separating fools from their money. You gain proficiency with all gaming sets. In addition, you gain an expertise on Sleight of Hand checks made to cheat.

###### Carefree

Stress seems to roll right off you and you know how to really enjoy the downtime. You have advantage on saving throws made to resist strife or mental stress effects. In addition, you have advantage on checks made for the Destress journey activity.

###### Coin Biter

With some thorough inspection you can determine if just about anything is genuine and how much it is worth. As an action you can accurately determine if an object you can both see and touch is authentic or a replica, and you can roughly determine how much it costs.

###### Crowd Diver

Once you dive back into the streets you disappear into the crowd. You have

advantage on Stealth checks made in crowded or densely populated areas.

###### Dastardly Devil

*Requirement: 9th level*

Your devilish luck spills over to your charm. Whenever you use Lucky Devil to reroll a die that would add your Dastardly Gambit die, you may choose to reroll the Dastardly Gambit die as well.

###### Dastardly Flying

Goading misdirects can be just as effective as skilled piloting. While piloting a starfighter you may spend Dastardly Gambit dice as if they were exertion points to perform starfighter maneuvers.

###### Digital Angler

You can be anyone online, and with enough effort your fake online personality can be very persuasive. If you spend at least a week with regular access to an online network, you can catfish a random stranger and convince them to perform one of the following actions:

* Be at a location at a certain time (that they could reasonably access).
* Pay you 6d6 credits.

Alternatively, you can attempt to catfish a specific target connected to the network. If you do, at the end of the week of catfishing the target makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC. On a failed save the target performs one of the listed actions as normal or a small favor it is capable of performing, such as leaving a specific door unlocked for you, telling you something confidential, or absolving a minor crime. The exact nature of this favor is at the Narrator’s discretion but should be limited to something a person would conceivably do for a friend they met online.

Once you convince or attempt to

convince a target to do something in this way, you must spend another week catfishing before you can do so again.

###### Divine Appeal

Holy men are often flush with cash so why not get in on the racket? You gain proficiency in Religion. In addition, you gain an expertise die on checks made to convince others of your faith (regardless of your actual beliefs).

###### Duct Rat

The first thing a good scout does on a large ship is learn all the ducts, back passages, and hiding places—spaces people rarely think to barricade. When you move between decks you can take back passages to move to barricaded decks without breaching them. When you do so, willing creatures can use their reactions to follow you.

###### Extra Dastardly

With a bit of practice you’re just that much more clever and underhanded. You gain one Dastardly Gambit die (in addition to those gained from your Charisma modifier). This clever trick may be selected more than once, up to a maximum number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

###### False Identities

When a badge demands your papers it’s always nice to have a name to give them. By spending 1 hour of uninterrupted work you can make fraudulent versions of all the appropriate legal documentation needed to prove that you or someone else is a completely different person. You may choose the name and any specifics of these false identities. Creatures can determine that your documentation is fraudulent by

succeeding on an Investigation check made against your clever tricks save DC.

###### Filch

With disguised or lightning fast movements you snag something or slip something into a pocket.

When a creature is within your reach, you can use your reaction to make a Sleight of Hand check against it.

###### First Impressions

A good first impression can make all the difference and you’ve put a lot of effort into making the best of first meetings. You gain an expertise die on Charisma checks relating to creatures you are meeting for the first time for up to 1 minute after your first interaction.

###### Glass to Diamond

There’s a sucker born every minute. You gain an expertise die on checks made to haggle or convince a creature that something is more valuable than it actually is.

###### Graceful Misdirect

You misdirect incoming danger at the last possible moment. When you are hit by an attack, you may roll one of your Dastardly Gambit dice, reducing the damage dealt by twice the result.

###### Hammy Tragedian

When you are hit by an attack you can use your reaction to pretend to die. When you do so, you scream, gurgle, and perhaps utter a few poignant final words before falling prone and appearing to die. So long as you remain in the space where you seem

to die creatures believe you to be dead. While playing dead in this way you can perform minor actions without breaking your ruse such as retrieving or stowing items, applying medical aid, or reloading weapons. Creatures can see through your ruse by using an action to interact with you directly, if their passive Perception score is equal to or higher than your clever tricks save DC, or if they similarly succeed on a Perception check against your clever tricks save DC. You can cease playing dead at any time.

Once a creature sees you die and revive from your faked death it is immune to this feature’s effects for the next 24 hours.

###### Handcuff Fighting

You know how to handle yourself even when they’ve got a hold of you, and a pair of cuffs can be an excellent weapon if you know what you’re doing. You ignore the following penalties that are normally incurred by the restrained condition:

* Attacks made against you do not have advantage due to the restrained condition.
* Attacks you make do not have disadvantage due to the restrained condition.

###### Hidden Threat

You can artfully hide or disguise weapons. Over the course of a long rest you can add the concealed weapon augment to a light melee or light ranged weapon in your possession at no cost.

###### Hotwiring

All it takes is a little rewiring to take the perfect ride as your own. While inside an inactive vehicle or starfighter you can use an action to begin hotwiring it, creating a fast countdown pool using 5d6. At the end of each of your turns that you spend hotwiring, roll these dice and remove any

with a result of 4–6. When there are no more dice remaining in the countdown pool the device is successfully hotwired, and any creature can pilot it even if it normally requires a key, password, or other security measure.

###### Improvised Decoy

The guard triumphantly tackles you only to discover that they’ve arrested a garbage bag wearing your hat. As an action you can hastily construct an improvised decoy in an adjacent space out of whatever materials you have on hand, often incorporating an article of your clothing but not requiring one. Any creature that did not directly observe you creating this decoy believes it is you unless they physically interact with it or succeed on a Perception check made against your clever tricks save DC. Once you have fooled a creature with an improvised decoy it is immune to this feature’s effects for the next 24 hours.

###### Insult the Hidden

With enough provocation you can force more insecure infiltrators to reveal their position. As an action you can spend a Dastardly Gambit die to make vicious insults directed at any potential hidden hostile creatures. Any creatures currently hidden from you that can hear you and that can understand you makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save creatures respond to your insults and are no longer hidden. Once you have used this feature against a creature it is immune to this feature’s effects for the next 24 hours.

###### Junk Flier

A flying hunk of junk just needs the right handling to really soar. Through a light touch and clever workarounds you can repair a critical malfunction of a deck you are crewing as an action. Repairs you make

in this way are only temporary fixes and are suffered again if not repaired properly after 8 hours. Once you repair a critical malfunction using this feature you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

###### Make it Happen

*Requirement: 5th level*

You know how to force the issue with an extra layer of charm or effort. Whenever you would roll your Dastardly Gambit die, you may expend an additional Dastardly Gambit die to treat it as if it rolled the maximum possible result.

###### Nobody’s Fool

It takes one to know one, and you know when somebody is trying to pull one over on you. You gain proficiency in Insight. In addition, you may always choose to use Charisma when making Insight checks.

###### Pressing Bravado

With enough bluster you can take ground even without the strength to back it up.

Whenever you take the Press the Attack action, the target creature makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, attacks made against you until your next turn only gain an expertise die (instead of advantage).

###### Pull the Pin

*Requirement: 11th level*

How kind of your enemies to bring their own petards for hoisting! You can attempt to activate an explosive worn or held by a target adjacent creature or device as a bonus action. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw or the explosive is activated and detonates (centered on the target) at the end of your turn.

###### Pyramid Scheme

Why take on risk when you can convince other people to do it for you? You can perform the Rob journey activity even in regions that would not normally allow it so long as you have a connection to an open network. In addition, you suffer no negative effects from critical failures for Rob journey activities made in this way.

###### Quick Change

Either through physical currency or quick digital transfers you can fluster the other person in a transaction so that you end up on top. You can attempt to scam a creature when you make a purchase from it. If you do, the creature makes an Intelligence saving throw against your clever tricks save DC or you steal a number of credits equal to your 1d12 × your proficiency bonus. On a successful save you don’t steal anything but the confusion is passed off as a mistake, though on a success by 10 or more the creature realizes that you were trying a scam.

###### Reckless Overload

*Requirement: 7th level*

With just a snipped wire here and there, practically any energy weapon can make for a handy improvised explosive. As a bonus action, you can set a weapon you are holding to explode so long as it uses an energy battery or long-life battery as ammunition. Once set in this way, you may use the weapon exactly as if it were a frag grenade that detonates at the end of your turn.

###### Right in the Tenders

In a truly dishonorable fashion, you hit your target where it’s most vulnerable. When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you may

roll your Dastardly Gambit die and add the result to the damage dealt.

###### Shoot First

You won’t be caught off guard and innately know when a deal is going south. When you roll for initiative you gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.

###### Showboater

Often it all comes down to putting on a good show. You gain proficiency in Performance. In addition, whenever you need to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you may instead make a Dexterity (Performance) check.

###### Skilled

You never know what skill will come in handy. You gain proficiency in any one skill or any two tool kits of your choice. This clever trick can be selected multiple times, each time choosing a different skill or two tool kits.

###### Specialized

Scouts are often full of eclectic specialities. You gain two skill specialties in two different skills of your choice. This clever trick can be selected multiple times, each time choosing two new different skill specialties in skills that have not yet been chosen in this way.

###### Technobabble

People will trust a fast-talker if they’re wearing a lab coat and spitting enough convincing jargon. You gain proficiency in Science. In addition, you can attempt to deceive people using scientific fast talk by making a Charisma (Science) check. Lies

told in this way can only be opposed using Science (instead of Insight as normal).

###### Witty Repartee

You know just how to draw attention and ire. As a bonus action you can engage a creature that can hear and understand you in witty repartee. If you do, the creature’s first attack during its next turn has disadvantage unless it targets you. Once you have used this feature against a creature it is immune to this feature’s effects for the next 24 hours.

##### Scout Archetypes

Scouts are differentiated by their methods. The end goal of some scouts is to separate a fool from their money but others are daring pilots or inspiring diplomats. Each scout archetype defines a different subtle style and attitude with unique tricks to employ.

###### Envoy

Blasters, swords, and grenades all have their place, but everyone knows that the pen–or indeed, the word–is mightier than the sword, and envoys wield a subtle power based on influence, information, and interpersonal connections. From ambassadors to entertainers, envoys rely on skill and charisma to negotiate the challenges that face them.

Cultural Expertise

At 3rd level you gain proficiency in Culture and three of the following list: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion. Additionally, you gain two Culture specialities and two languages of your choice.

Always The Right Words

Also at 3rd level, you are able to inspire your allies to greater heights. You have a pool of envoy dice equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use your reaction to expend one envoy die whenever an ally who can hear and understand you makes an ability check or saving throw. That ally may roll the envoy die and add it to the result of their original die roll.

Your envoy die is a d4. You can donate multiple envoy dice to the same ability check or saving throw; in this case, the envoy dice act like expertise dice, and increase–to a maximum of a d8–in die size by one stage for each additional envoy die, from d4 to d6, to d8.

You regain spent uses of your envoy dice after you have finished a long rest.

Universal Translator

Beginning at 6th level, your linguistic expertise is unparalleled. You can make a DC 10 Culture check to understand, speak, and sign in any currently used language. If you fail the check, you cannot attempt to do so again with that language until at least one week has passed, during which you are able to brush up on linguistic patterns and commonalities.

Silver Tongue

Also at 6th level, you can sway people to your way of thinking, either with a speech, an appeal to a creature’s own cultural interests, a threat, a clever web of lies, or a musical performance. You must be proficient in Persuasion to use a speech, Insight to use an appeal, Intimidation to use a threat, Deception to use lies, or Performance to use music. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to your clever tricks save DC.

On a failed save a creature gains the charmed condition for one minute. After one minute, and every minute thereafter, they

may make another saving throw. The condition ends when the creature makes a successful saving throw.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until after you have finished a long rest.

Allies Everywhere

At 14th level, you have allies–or those in your debt–everywhere. You may ‘reveal’ an undisclosed ally, who might be a member of an enemy’s retinue, a government official, or somebody with access to important facilities or resources, but it cannot be the leader of those who oppose you.

As an action, target a creature with whom you can communicate and who can understand you. Your prospective ally must make a saving throw with a DC equal to your clever tricks save DC. On a failed save, that ally will immediately begin to work with you, even turning on their employers or supposed former allies. Your ally will work with you until you next take a long rest, after which their obligation to you is fulfilled and you cannot recruit them again. As part of this feature, your ally may have secretly performed an action in the past 24 hours which they would have been capable of and had opportunity to carry out.

Once you have successfully used this feature you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

###### Scoundrel

Scoundrels are charming, rakish, and usually lying through their teeth. To them society is just propaganda and tradition is only peer pressure from dead people.

These scouts forge their own paths, refuse to be tied down, and know that rules are made to be broken. Everybody’s got to eat though, which often puts the fiercely independent scoundrel at odds with authorities—thankfully they know to run when the chips are down, and with a quip

and a smile can suavely flip even the worst situations to their benefit.

Honest Face

At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks. In addition, you can use Dastardly Gambit on yourself when making a Charisma check, adding

the result of the die to your check.

Fiercely Independent

Also at 3rd level, you become adept at escaping even the most precarious circumstances and your individualist attitude is almost infectious. You gain the following benefits:

* You can use the Disengage action as a bonus action.
* You have advantage on checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.
* You have advantage on Charisma checks made to dissuade a creature from following orders, to sow discord amidst an organization, or otherwise disrupt a group of cooperators.

Just a Misunderstanding

Beginning at 6th level, you develop a talent for spinning even the most ludicrous circumstances into plausible stories.

Whenever you add a Dastardly Gambit die to a Charisma check made to influence a hostile creature, that creature’s attitude to you is treated as if it were indifferent even if you or your allies were previously or are currently fighting it. Any past attacks or aggressive actions are woven into your strangely credible version of events that eases over blame, but this does not forgive future attacks or aggressive actions taken after you use this feature.

Defector’s Spark

Starting at 14th level, you’ve learned just the right words to get people to cast off their shackles and rebel. As an action, you may choose a hostile creature that is operating under the command of another creature that is hostile to you. So long as the target is able to hear you, of a Challenge Rating 5 below your level, and can understand a language that you speak, it makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC. On a failed save the target is convinced to change sides and becomes an ally to you and your other allies, even becoming hostile to its former allies. The chosen creature is not under your control and may change its attitudes later depending on your actions or the actions of your allies. This is not a charm effect. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.

###### Miscreant

Rebels with or without a cause, miscreants shake things up and break heads. Where clever words fail, a closed fist–the threat of one–can work just as well. These scouts take charge, not orders, and spit in the face of danger. Bravado is often all that’s needed, but miscreants are able to back up their bluster when required.

Rebellious Scrapper

At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you become capable of holding your own in a scrap and to take the most brutal advantage of your dirty tricks. You gain the following benefits:

* You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
* You can attempt either the Knockdown or Shove basic maneuver as a bonus action. Knockdown and Shove basic maneuvers made in this way use your

clever tricks DC instead of your Maneuver DC.

* Whenever you use a bonus action to trick a creature using Dirty Fighting or to perform the Disarm, Knockdown, or Shove basic maneuvers and the target fails its saving throw, you may immediately make a weapon attack against that target as a part of the same bonus action.

Sincere Bluster

Also at 3rd level, you gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. In addition, you can use Dastardly Gambit on yourself when making an Intimidation check, adding the die roll to your check.

Always Dangerous

Beginning at 6th level, you learn to make the most out of practically nothing. Attacks you make with improvised weapons deal an additional 1d6 damage. This die changes as you gain scout levels, improving to 1d8 when you reach 12th level, and 1d10 when you reach 17th level. In addition, you have advantage on checks made to conceal an improvised weapon on your person or to pass it off as not dangerous.

Heel-Turn

Starting at 14th level, you’ve figured the right turn of phrase to get just enough trust to twist the knife. As an action, you may target a creature with an Intelligence of 5 or higher that can hear you and understand a language that you speak. The target makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC. On a failed save you may immediately make a weapon attack against the target with advantage. On a hit the attack becomes a critical hit. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.

###### Scammer

The advance of technology replaced roadside scams and games of chance with more sophisticated schemes. The ability to suss out a poor password can be just as valuable as a pretty face, and scammers often steal fortunes all from entire worlds away. Why take any risk when playing the subtle trade online offers the security of anonymity?

Digital Confidence

At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain an expertise die on computers checks and on hacking tools checks. In addition, you can use Dastardly Gambit on yourself when making a hacking tools check.

Wireless Swindler

Also at 3rd level, you learn all the nuances of a seasoned confidence scammer from behind the safety of a firewall. You gain the following benefits:

* You can initiate hacking a device as a bonus action.
* You may always choose to use Charisma when making a hacking tools check.
* When you perform the Digital Pickpocket hacking maneuver, it only costs you 1 countdown die.

Cyberspace Chameleon

Beginning at 6th level, you set custom virtual avatars and rerouters that allow you to appear however you like online.

Whenever you communicate through a device you may choose to look and sound like a specific person you’re familiar with, an online persona, or simply as an unknown figure. Creatures can see through this ruse by making an Insight check against your clever tricks save DC, but on a success it

remains unclear who you are, only revealing that your transmission is masked. In addition, you can reroute your location data to a different false location, and successful counter hacking attempts to trace your location only yield your chosen false location.

Virulent Hacker

At 14th level, you’ve created devastating viruses and learned how to convince the unwary to let you into their systems. As an action, you may target a sentient device, an augmented creature, or a creature currently crewing or piloting a device that can hear you. The target makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC or you infect it with an insidious computer virus. So long as you remain hacking the device any attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws made by or made using the hacked device have disadvantage. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.

###### Sleuth

Sometimes you need a rogue to catch a rogue, and sleuths have to be familiar with all the tricks of the trade. Sometimes, the only difference is what side of the law you’re on. Sleuths are experts at uncovering the truth, following clues, and solving mysteries. Some are detectives employed by the government, while others operate solo as private investigators or as part of a group.

Natural Intuition

At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain an expertise die on Insight and Investigation checks and you also gain the *detecting lies* Insight speciality.

Registration Lookup

Also at 3rd level, you have access to official registration records–whether legally or via a ‘friend’ in law enforcement–and can request the registered owner and address of a starship as long as you know it’s registration ID–often displayed on the hull of a ship, but also automatically available by its transponder code. The process usually takes one hour.

I Need A Location On The Suspect

Beginning at 6th level, you become adept at finding your target by using official–and unofficial–databases, old connections, and other surveillance techniques. When trying to locate an individual, you have advantage on that check. You can narrow your target down to a planetary body, but if you critically succeed on the check, you can pinpoint it to a city or other settlement. You can use the following methods (or others with the Narrator’s approval) to locate your target:

* Use databases with an Intelligence (computers) check.
* Contact old friends and allies with a Charisma (investigation) check.

The DC of the check is based on the target’s distance:

**Distance DC**

Same settlement 13

Same planet 15

Same system 17

Nearby system 19

Distant system 21

Different galaxy 24

If the target is deliberately hiding or undercover, you have disadvantage on your check.

At 9th level you can use this feature to locate a specific, obscure type of object or person, such as an expert hacker or rare source of trilithium.

There’s Something Wrong Here

Starting at 14th level, you gain advantage on ability checks made to spot hidden objects, from concealed weapons to secret compartments (if you are using a passive check, simply add 5 to your passive score as usual).

###### Smuggler

Smugglers make their way in life by always being one step ahead of the law.

Regardless of the nation or creed, societies always decide something or other shouldn’t be allowed. These scouts believe the most restrictive laws make for the most profitable business—so long as they’re able to remain flying under the radar. Naturally quick to ease tension or cut through it, smugglers are often long gone before anyone is the wiser.

Dastardly Instincts

At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain an expertise die on initiative checks. In addition, you can use Dastardly Gambit on yourself when rolling initiative, adding the die roll to your check.

Quick Tricks

Also at 3rd level, you learn the ebb and flow of encounters and right when to spring your dirty tricks. You gain the following benefits:

* When a creature that can see or hear you is targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to try to confuse, trick, or otherwise distract it. The target makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC or the triggering attack is made with advantage. Once you have used this feature against a creature, it is

immune to this feature’s effects for the next 24 hours.

* When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to attempt the Disarm basic maneuver against your attacker. Disarm maneuvers made in this way use your clever tricks DC instead of your maneuver DC.
* When a hostile creature moves adjacent to you, you can use your reaction to take the Dash action.

Everything’s Fine

Starting at 6th level, you know just how to smooth things over before people go too far, or how to take advantage of the confusion before it does. While you are engaged in combat, you have advantage on Charisma checks made against creatures that haven’t yet taken a turn. In addition, while in combat any creature that hasn’t taken a turn yet has disadvantage on saving throws against your clever tricks save DC.

Shocking Turnabout

At 14th level, you know how to surprise everyone and turn a bad situation around. As an action, you can make a shocking declaration, the exact nature of which is up to your discretion. Any hostile creature that can hear and understand you makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC. On a failed save a creature is surprised and it cannot move or take actions or reactions until the beginning of your next turn. Creatures surprised in this way are treated as if they have not yet taken a turn in combat. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.

###### Spy

Subterfuge is not only the purview of con artists. Militaries, governments, gangs, and

empires alike all need a subtle touch to acquire intelligence or infiltrate their enemies at an arm’s length with plausible deniability. Espionage is an artform and the top spies are true masters, able to shift the course of history or lop off the heads of state leaving little to no evidence that they ever existed at all.

Clandestine

At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain an expertise die on Deception checks and Stealth checks. In addition, you can use Dastardly Gambit on yourself when making a Stealth check or Charisma check, adding the die roll to your check.

Infiltration Expert

Also at 3rd level, you become an expert at slipping into and out of different roles. You can be anyone anywhere whenever you need to be. You gain the following benefits:

* You can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
* You have advantage on disguise kit checks.
* You gain an expertise die on Charisma checks.

Spy Gadget

Beginning at 6th level, you’ve either acquired or made a special covert spy gadget. This spy gadget often takes the form of a watch or wrist PCD, but can be your choice of any innocuous object or piece of apparel that you wear or carry on your person. While not in use your spy gadget has the benefits of a Concealed Weapon augment. When you first gain your spy gadget, choose 3 of the following items and weapons:

* Airhypo
* Binoculars
* Bug
* Bug detector
* Chemical detector
* Construction foam
* Cryospray
* Distress beacon
* Flame bracer
* Flashlight
* Grapple gun
* Grenade launcher
* Hacking tools
* Hypodermic pistol
* Jolt pistol
* Light maul
* Light caster
* Light polearm
* Light blade
* Long range microphone
* Mono-whip
* Multi-scanner
* Netcaster
* Night vision/multispectrum goggles
* Pistol
* Portable computing device (pcd)
* Portable x-ray scanner
* Signal jammer
* Spray adhesive
* TK gauntlet
* Tracer
* Umbrella
* Universal airhypo
* Weapons and armor maintenance tools
* Zero-friction lubricant

Your spy gadget can be used as the chosen items or weapons. If one of your chosen items has a set number of uses, lost uses can be restored at the cost of the item over the course of a long rest.

Whenever you gain a scout level you may choose an additional item for your spy gadget. Whenever you choose a new item in this way, you may either create a new separate spy gadget or add the newly chosen item to an existing spy gadget.

If your spy gadget is lost or destroyed, you can make or acquire a new one over the course of a long rest by spending an amount of credits equal to cost of the item.

Provoked Monologue

At 14th level, you’ve dealt with inflated egos and know how to trick them into telling too much. As an action, you may choose a hostile creature that can hear you and understand a language you can speak. The creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your clever tricks save DC or becomes charmed by you. While charmed in this way the creature monologues its plans while utterly convinced of its inevitable victory. It cannot perform actions or bonus actions, but may still make reactions. At the Narrator’s discretion, creatures may reveal important information while monologuing, particularly if bragging about that information would serve the creature’s ego. A creature remains charmed for 1d6 rounds, or until a hostile action is taken against it or an ally it can see. Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this feature. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.

###### Star Pilot

In the void, most people can operate basic transport–they can fly a shuttle or man the helm of a cargo ship. But a few devote their lives to the art and craft of piloting, able to perform maneuvers and heroic feats whether diving a small fighter between the laser turrets of a vast destroyer, navigating a dense asteroid field at breakneck speed, or carefully directing a massive exploration vessel into a mysterious nebula. These are the star pilots, the helm officers, the dashing aces who rule the void.

Natural Instinct

At 3rd level, you gain a combat maneuver from the Ace Starfighter tradition.

Additionally, your starfighter maneuver DC increases by 1 point.

Reflexive Maneuvers

At 6th level, you gain a combat maneuver from the Ace Starfighter tradition.

Additionally, your starfighter’s armor class increases by 1 point.

Flying Ace

At 14th level, you gain a combat maneuver from the Ace Starfighter tradition.

Finally, when determining your maximum maneuver degree in the Ace Starfighter tradition, your maximum maneuver degree in that tradition is 1 degree higher than shown in Table: Scout (becoming 4th at 14th-level, and 5th at 19th level).

As a trooper, you gain the following class features.

###### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per trooper level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier

You begin the game with 450 credits, which you can spend on your character’s starting weapons, armor, and adventuring gear. You can select your own gear or choose one of the following equipment packages. Also consult the Suggested Equipment section of your chosen background.

* **Demolitionist’s Kit (cost 447 credits):** grenade launcher, frag grenades (3), smoke grenades (2), personal communicator, light maul, multitool, synthweave armor, tactical case

###### Drills

Thanks to your years of training, you know how to handle yourself in almost any situation. At 1st level you gain two drills of your choice, detailed at the end of the class description. The Drills Know column of the Trooper table shows when you learn more drills.

###### Favored Ordnance

All weapons are deadly in your hands, but one type of weapon is your favorite. At 1st level, choose a specific category of weapon, such as light mauls, medium casters, or cannons. You can also choose a miscellaneous weapon (such bio-chakram or combat chainsaw) as your favored ordnance.

Attacks you make with your favored ordnance deal an additional 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. Your favored ordnance damage applies only to damage that requires an attack roll. Thus, you can’t increase the damage dealt by a grenade or a weapon’s burst property, unless you have a special ability that allows you to do so.

This extra damage increases as you gain trooper levels, as shown in the Favored Ordnance column of the Trooper table.

Once you deal your favored ordnance damage, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of your favored ordnance selections with another weapon.

###### Tenacity

Your courage never wavers, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Choose one of the following options.

Cool Under Pressure

Regardless of the pressures placed upon you, you somehow manage to keep it together. You have advantage on saving throws against effects that inflict strife or mental stress, as well as on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.

Indomitable Soul

You never back down, not while lives hang in the balance. While you are bloodied, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your trooper level.

These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. While the temporary hit points last, you are immune to the frightened and rattled conditions. If you are frightened or rattled when you use this ability, the effects of these conditions are suspended until the end of this effect.

Rounds spent under the influence of Indomitable Soul count towards the duration of these frightened and rattled conditions.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Tireless Loyalty

Nothing can convince you to turn on those you’ve promised to protect or break the ideals you’ve sworn to uphold. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed. While you are charmed by a condition that allows a saving throw at the end of your turn, you can choose to make the save at the start of your turn instead.

###### Basic Training

Your training brought you into contact with people from all sorts of different backgrounds. At 2nd level, choose one of the following options.

Chains of Command

You know who’s in charge—and more importantly, who’s really in charge of an organization (such as a police precinct) or group of individuals (such as a party of rival voidrunners). If you have encountered an organization's leader, you know who’s officially in charge according to that group’s chain of command, as well as the attitudes of each of the group’s members towards their leader.

Soldier of Fortune

You’ve worked (or currently work) as a mercenary, taking part in military conflicts for personal profit. Anyone in need of a little extra muscle may come to you with job offers, and you have advantage on ability checks you make to find such jobs or negotiate their terms.

The jobs may involve some measure of danger, and they may not pay particularly well. But you’re never out of work, at least not for long.

War Stories

Even soldiers who haven’t fought together often share similar experiences. If you spend a few minutes swapping stories from your past with someone from a military background, you have advantage on the next Persuasion check you make to influence them.

###### Combat Maneuvers

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions of your choice. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest . You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known column of the Trooper table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

##### Trooper Archetype

At 3rd level, choose a trooper archetype. Though you are familiar with weapons of all sorts, your archetype represents the types of weapons you’ve chosen to focus your training on. You gain benefits from your choice of archetype at 3rd level, then more at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

###### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

###### Extra Attack

At 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the attack action on your turn.

###### Combat Theater

If your experience on the battlefield has taught you anything, it’s that warfare is as much psychological as it is physical. At 6th level, choose one of the following options.

Crowd Control

With a few simple, barked commands, you can impose order on an otherwise unruly crowd. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks.

Finger on the Trigger

Sometimes polite requests must be backed up with threats of violence. When one of your allies makes a Persuasion check, you can use your reaction to ready your firearm or brush the hilt of your blade. If the target of the Persuasion check can see you, your ally gains an expertise die on the check.

Hearts and Minds

It is a sad fact of war that the innocent are often caught in the crossfire, but you do your best to keep them safe. When you make efforts to keep a

non-combatant out of harm’s way, word of your heroism spreads, and any members of their community who were previously indifferent to you become friendly.

##### Endurance

Starting at 9th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to push your body and mind beyond their natural limits. For the next minute, you ignore the negative effects of any fatigue, strife, or mental stress effects you are currently suffering. At the end of that time, the negative effects return, and you gain one level of either fatigue or stress (your choice).

You can use this feature once. You gain an additional use of this feature at 13th level and a third use starting at 17th level.

You regain all spent uses of this feature whenever you finish a long rest.

###### Pillar of Strength

In the heat of battle, others look to you for guidance. The faith that others place in you extends to non-combat situations, as well. At 10th level, you gain one of the following options.

Celebrity Soldier

Your victories on the battlefield have won you the respect of leaders across the galaxy. Regardless of your Prestige score, your Prestige Center covers an entire planet, or even multiple planets, at the Narrator’s discretion. In addition, prominent politicians, businesspeople, and celebrities come to you asking for favors and may be willing to perform favors for you in return. The Narrator determines the nature of these interactions. For example, the head of a shipping conglomerate may arrange transport for you and your companions to one of their off-planet facilities in return for a review of the facility’s security. Similarly, if you endorse a politician’s run for office, they may open doors for you in the future.

Impartial Judge

Your integrity is known to be above reproach, and others may call upon you to issue punishments or settle disputes. Your Prestige rating increases by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. In addition, other people can always sense when you’re telling the truth (or at least, the truth as you see it). While others may not always agree with your decisions, so long as you do your best to remain impartial, your integrity is rarely called into question.

Veteran’s Insight

Others seek out your advice, hoping to gain insight from the lessons you’ve learned on the battlefield. A creature that listens to your advice for at least 1 minute gains an expertise dice on one ability check of its choice that it makes in the next 24 hours. Once someone has benefited from your Veteran’s Insight, they can’t do so again for another 24 hours. If an NPC follows your advice and it works out well for them, they become friendly towards you and remain so until you give them reason to change their mind.

###### Legion Commander

At this point in your career, you may find yourself commanding hundreds, or even thousands, of people. At 18th level, you gain one of the following options.

Address the Troops

Your words inspire those under your command to fight without fear. You gain proficiency in Persuasion. If you’re already proficient in Persuasion, you instead gain an expertise die.

In addition, if you spend 10 minutes giving an inspiring speech, each creature you choose with an Intelligence

of 4 or greater that can hear and understand you is filled with courage and resolve. Affected creatures gain 20 temporary hit points. While the temporary hit points last, the creature gains an expertise die on saving throws against becoming frightened.

With the right technology on hand, you can greatly extend the number of creatures you can affect and the distance at which you can do so, even on a galactic scale.

Once you’ve used this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

Security Clearance

Governments and military organizations trust you with their most guarded secrets. With a few phone calls to the right people, you can make a Prestige check to obtain a high-level security clearance, granting you access to data such as the location of a top-secret military installation, the blueprints of The Fleet’s capital ship, or the medical files of the Emperor. Organizations hostile to you will never knowingly issue you a security clearance. Under most circumstances, your security clearance expires after 2 days. Once you’ve used this ability, you must wait a week before you can do so again.

Thousand-Foot View

You can survey the broad strokes of a military campaign to pinpoint an enemy’s weak spot. This survey takes the duration of a long rest and might involve reviewing stacks of field reports, analyzing thousands of AI-generated combat simulations, or simply pushing a few small-scale models across a replica battlefield. At the end of the long rest (which you still benefit from normally), you uncover a fatal flaw in your enemy’s organization, such as an easily

disrupted supply line or a shield generator they’ve left undefended.

The Narrator determines the nature of the information you uncover. Your stratagem is often time sensitive, and even if you act on it, there’s no guarantee the plan will succeed. Once you’ve used this ability in a campaign, you can’t do so again until the specifics of the campaign you’re analyzing significantly change.

##### Never Surrender

Even a mortal wound can’t stop you from fighting—at least for a while. At 20th level, when you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points but doesn’t kill you, you don’t fall unconscious and can continue acting normally. You still make death saving throws at the start of your turn, suffer death saving throws whenever you take damage, and die after three failed death saving throws. If you are stabilized during this time, you remain conscious, but fall unconscious after 1 minute if you do not regain at least 1 hit point.

##### Drills

When you gain access to a new drill, choose one of the following.

###### Action Hero

You’re daring, dynamic, and rush headlong into danger. On your turn, you can take an additional Dash action and gain an expertise die on Acrobatics and Athletics checks you make during the Dash. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

###### Combat Medic

Even under the worst conditions, you can apply first aid to keep your allies alive. You can use an action to restore a number of hit points to an ally within reach equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You can use this drill a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Your expended uses are restored when you take a long or short rest.

###### Defensive Reload

You can keep your wits about you as you get ready to fire. You can reload a weapon with the reload property as part of a Dodge action.

###### Double Time

You move efficiently while on the march and can help those you travel with keep pace.

You can move twice as fast on a journey. Any allies without this drill that you choose to keep pace with can move 50 percent faster than they would normally be able to.

###### Favored Front

You’ve learned to fight in different kinds of terrain. Choose one type of terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, subterranean, or swamp. You gain an expertise die on Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks made in this terrain. You can take this drill multiple times, choosing a new terrain each time.

###### Gear Up

A soldier’s gear helps keep them alive, so you’ve learned to pack and handle it efficiently. You can don and doff armor in half the time it would normally take. Your Strength score is considered 5 higher when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can lift, push, or drag.

###### Grunt Work

You’re not above getting a little dirt under your fingernails. You gain proficiency in carpenter’s tools, cook’s utensils, or another set of artisan’s tools allowed by the Narrator. In addition, when performing manual labor, you gain an expertise die on Constitution saving throws to resist fatigue.

###### Lead the Charge

When the time comes to engage the enemy, you make sure you’re always on the front lines, with your allies close behind. You gain an expertise die on initiative rolls. When you roll initiative, you can select one willing ally who rolled lower than you. For the rest of the encounter, that ally acts in the initiative count directly after you.

###### No One Left Behind

You gain an expertise die on Acrobatics and Athletics checks made to climb, jump, run, and swim. When your party makes a group Acrobatics or Athletics check, you may apply the results of your roll to yourself and one ally. You can choose which ally to apply your result to after everyone has rolled, but must do so before the Narrator says whether you succeed or fail.

###### Paratrooper

You gain an expertise die on Acrobatics and Athletics checks you make while falling or skydiving. When you take falling damage, you can use your reaction to make an Acrobatics check and reduce the damage by an amount equal to the result of the check.

###### Quick Reload

When reloading your weapon in the heat of battle, your hands act from muscle memory alone. You can reload a weapon with the reload property as a bonus action instead of an action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

###### Recon

Hours spent on patrol have honed your senses. You gain proficiency in Perception. If you’re already proficient in Perception, you instead gain an expertise die.

Additionally, when performing the Scout journey activity, you don’t suffer a level of fatigue on a critical failure.

###### Rest and Relaxation

You know how important a little R & R can be. When you spend hit dice during a short rest to recover hit points, you can roll each die twice and use the better result.

###### Security Detail

You’re always on the lookout for trouble. Your passive Perception score increases by 3, and you can never be surprised.

###### Starship Trooper

You’re well accustomed to life aboard starships. While aboard a starship or similar vehicle, you gain an expertise die if you’re using a skill you’re proficient in.

###### Tour of Duty

You’ve learned to interact with people of cultures different from your own. You are proficient in Culture and gain a skill

specialty in Culture. In addition, you learn three languages of your choice.

###### Weapons Maintenance

Keeping your gear in proper working order can mean the difference between life and death when the bullets start to fly. You gain an expertise die on checks to maintain or repair weapons and armor.

##### Trooper Archetypes

More so than perhaps any other martial class, troopers are differentiated by the weapons with which they choose to fight. Depending on the archetype you choose, you might be a professional duelist who fights to defend the honor of your house, a mercenary whose skill with firearms devastates those you’ve been paid to fight, or an enlisted soldier specially trained in the use of grenades, mines, and other explosive devices.

###### Armiger

In many societies, the ability to own weapons is a right reserved for the specially trained or the privileged elite. Whether or not you subscribe to that philosophy, you know that those who bear arms must treat their weapons as though they were sacred. To you, combat is more than a career: it is a calling, an honor, and a duty.

Weapon Mastery

At 3rd level, choose three additional weapons as your favored ordnance. If you spend 1 hour practicing with a weapon, you can replace one of your favored ordnance selections with the new weapon.

Precision Strike

You’ve learned to hone your focus, drowning out all distractions to make a single, precise attack. At 3rd level, while wielding one of your favored ordnance weapons, you can use an action to make a precision strike. Make a single attack as normal, but if you roll a 2 or lower on the attack roll, you can reroll the die and use the new result. The threshold for this reroll increases with your proficiency bonus.

Thus, at 5th level you can reroll an attack roll whenever you roll a 3 or lower. You can reroll on a roll of 4 or lower at 9th level, on a roll of 5 or lower at 13th level, and on a roll of 6 or lower at 17th level. You can choose to reroll after learning whether the attack hits or misses.

You can’t make a precision strike more than once on your turn, and you can’t make a precision strike outside of your turn. Thus, you can’t use this feature in conjunction with your Barrage feature or when making opportunity attacks.

Barrage

At 7th level, when you use the Attack action to make an attack with one of your favored ordnance weapons, you can choose to make an additional attack as part of the same action. If you do, you do not apply your favored ordnance damage to any attacks made using that attack action.

At 16th level, you can forgo your favored ordnance damage to make two additional attacks. Alternatively, you can make one additional attack, but if you do, you reduce your favored ordnance damage to 1d12 for both attacks.

Expert Technique

Also at 7th level, enemies who face you on the battlefield soon realize they’re outmatched. You learn one of the following expert techniques. Whenever you use the Attack action while wielding one of your favored ordnance weapons, you can

attempt an expert technique that you know in place of an attack. When you successfully use an expert technique, you can choose to deal your favored ordnance damage to the target, even if another feature (such as your Barrage feature) would otherwise cause you to forgo your favored ordnance damage.

Demoralizing Knockdown

Your attack knocks the target flat on its back. If the target is no more than one size category larger than you, it makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal your favored ordnance damage and knock the target prone. In addition, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn. While rattled, the target can’t stand up, though it can crawl.

Disquieting Disarm

You attempt to knock an item or weapon from a creature’s hand. The target makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal your favored ordnance damage and the target drops the item in its space. In addition, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn. Creatures that are a size category larger than you or that are holding the item with at least two hands have advantage on this save, while a creature of a size category smaller than you has disadvantage.

While rattled, the target must use an action to recover its weapon or draw a new one.

Exposing Shove

Your attack staggers your target, exposing it to follow-up attacks. If the target is one size category larger than you or smaller, it makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal your favored ordnance damage and push the target a

number of feet away from you equal to 5

+ 5 for every 5 points it failed its saving throw by. In addition, the target is rattled until the end of your next turn. While rattled, attack rolls against the target are made with advantage.

Armiger’s Creed

At 10th level, your devotion to your code of ethics is its own defense. You gain proficiency with Wisdom saving throws.

Matchless Maneuvers

At 15th-level your prowess with weaponry is unmatched. When you gain this feature, you gain every feature from Expert Techniques instead of only selecting one.

Living Weapon

At 18th level, the connection you share with your weapons deepens to an almost supernatural level. You can use a bonus action to expend up to 3 Hit Dice. Instead of regaining hit points, you channel your will into a favored ordnance weapon you are holding. For each Hie Die you expend, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with the weapon. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you no longer hold the weapon, fall unconscious, or use this ability again.

###### Bounty Hunter

True dedication is needed to track down a mark across the vast universe and bring them to justice—or to drag them back to whoever’s paying for their hide. Bounty hunting is a profession that has stood the test of time, and even in the age of space travel there will always be a need to find those who wish to remain hidden. Bounty hunters are experts trackers, stalking their

prey for glory and profit no matter how many lightyears their trail is long.

Eclectic Ordnance

Bounty hunters are known for their unusual weapons. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, every weapon with the exotic property becomes a favored ordnance weapon for you. In addition, when you deal damage with a favored ordnance weapon that reduces one or more creatures to 0 hit points, you can choose to stabilize one of the creatures knocked unconscious by it.

On the Hunt

Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Perception and Survival. In addition, you have advantage on checks made to detect hidden creatures.

Hunting Tactics

Starting at 7th level, you develop tactics needed for tracking down and subduing your bounties. You learn one of the following features.

Eye for Faces

No matter the disguise, once you get a read on your mark you’d know it anywhere. By spending at least a minute chatting with and closely observing a creature, you can memorize it and its mannerisms. You can instantly and accurately recognize any creature you memorize in this way, and you can automatically see through any disguise it uses so long as you are able to both see it and hear it speak. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks.

Self-Reliant

Bounty hunters are often on their own for months at a time as they follow the trail. You gain a 1d6 expertise die on any check made to hunt or gather food, and you do not suffer levels of fatigue due to travel pace. In addition, you are immune to the effects of roughing it and gain an expertise die on Survival checks.

Skilled Tracker

Whenever you make a Perception check or Survival check to track or to perform the Track journey activity and the d20 result is less than 10, you can count the d20 result as being 10.

Quarry Brawler

Also at 7th level, you become adept at the sort of brawling needed to bring in your bounties. You can use a bonus action to perform a Disarm, Grab On, Grapple, Knockdown, or Shove basic maneuver. In addition, whenever you would deal basic melee damage, you may deal your favored ordnance damage instead.

At 16th level, you may perform up to two of the above basic maneuvers using the same bonus action.

Knockout

At 10th level you start to appreciate that the “alive” part of dead or alive takes more effort but usually pays better. Whenever you deal your favored ordnance damage to a creature while it is bloodied, it makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed save the creature is knocked unconscious for 1 hour. A creature knocked unconscious in this way can repeat the saving throw when it takes damage or if another adjacent creature uses an action to wake it. Once a creature

successfully saves against this feature it is immune to Knockout for the next 24 hours.

Apex Hunter

Beginning at 15th level, your name on a docket is a verifiable guarantee that your target will be caught. You gain every feature from Hunting Tactics instead of only selecting one.

You’re Coming With Me

At 18th level you can bring in even the most dangerous bounties. You may at any time choose a creature you can see and mark it. The mark lasts until you choose to end it or until you use this feature to mark another target. You gain an expertise die on attacks against the marked target, as well as on Perception and Survival checks made to track or locate it. In addition, the marked target has disadvantage on saving throws against your maneuver DC. Once you mark a creature in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

###### Demolitions Expert

It takes a certain kind of mindset to devote one’s life to blowing stuff up, and the process is as much art as it is science.

Shaping an explosive’s charge so that it produces the exact effect you intend, detonating it in a glorious cataclysm of fire and shrapnel—it speaks to some in a way nothing else quite does.

Explosives Mastery

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, grenades and mines count as favored ordnance weapons for you. When a grenade you throw or a mine you have set deals damage, targets in the grenade or mine’s blast radius take additional damage equal to your favored ordnance damage.

The damage type of this extra damage is the same as the type normally dealt by that grenade or mine.

Eye for Architecture

Also at 3rd level, you’ve learned to pinpoint the weaknesses in any structure. You gain proficiency in Engineering. If you’re already proficient in Engineering, you instead gain an expertise die. Your expertise dice in Engineering can be upgraded from d8 to d10, exceeding the usual limit on expertise dice.

Parabolic Trajectory

Beginning at 3rd level, you learn how to launch grenades in an arcing, parabolic trajectory, increasing their range. Your grenades have the thrown 30/60 property. When you use a grenade launcher to fire a grenade, the launcher’s range increases to 200/800.

Expanded Blast Radius

At 7th level, when a grenade you throw or a mine you have set explodes, you can increase its blast radius by 5 feet. If you do, you do not add your favored ordnance damage to the damage dealt by the grenade or mine (if any).

At 16th level, you can expand the blast radius of a grenade or mine by 10 feet. If you do, do not add your favored ordnance damage to the damage dealt by the grenade or mine (if any). Alternatively, you can reduce your favored ordnance damage to 1d12 to expand the blast radius by 5 feet.

Custom Munitions

Also at 7th level, you can create custom munitions. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create a number of custom munitions equal to your proficiency bonus. Each of your custom munitions replicates the effects of one of the following grenades or mines, chosen by you when you create the munitions: foam, flash, frag, gas, goo, smoke (see Chapter 3: Equipment for details). Your custom munitions can be used even by creatures other than you, but only retain their functionality until the start of your next long rest.

In addition, you can customize the munitions you create even further with custom augments. You learn one of the following custom augments, which can be applied only to grenades or mines you create using this feature. You choose the augment you apply to each custom munition individually, but each can only have one augment.

Energized

If the grenade or mine deals damage, you can change the damage it normally deals to one of the following types: acid, fire, force, lightning, poison, radiant, thunder.

High Explosive

If the grenade or mine deals damage, the damage dice ‘explode’. Any maximum roll on a die (e.g. a 6 on a d6 or an 8 on a d8) allow you to roll that die again, and add the new roll to the original.

Shaped

You can alter the grenade or mine’s blast radius to a 60 foot cone or a line that is 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. If

you choose this augment, you can’t use your Expanded Blast Radius feature to alter the size of the grenade or mine’s blast.

Blast Evasion

At 10th level, you have advantage on saving throws made against grenades, mines, and other explosives. In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

Munitions Factory

At 15th level, you become a veritable munitions factory. You learn all the custom augments listed in the Custom Munitions feature. In addition, you can create custom munitions when you finish a short or long rest and can create a total number of munitions equal to twice your proficiency bonus per long rest, though they still lose their efficacy as normal.

Creative Destruction

At 18th level, you’ve developed your ability to create explosives into a true art form. You gain the following benefits.

* Your custom munitions can replicate the effects of the following grenades or mines: concussion, EMP, incendiary, stun.
* You can now add two custom augments to any of your custom munitions.
* You can use an action to respec one of the custom munitions you have already created, quickly changing its type and any augments you have applied to it. Once you have used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

###### Gunner

Even in a world where starships bombard planets from orbit, warfare often comes down to soldiers with their boots on the ground and guns in their hands. Depending on your background, you might be a soldier in a legitimate military organization or a gun for hire, fighting on behalf of whatever employer pays you best. In either case, firearms are your weapon of choice. With a gun and enough ammo, you can unleash a salvo that decimates enemy forces or lay down a burst of cover fire, providing the distraction your allies need to make a safe retreat.

Firearms Mastery

At 3rd level, you gain all firearms as your favored ordnance. When you use the burst property of a firearm, targets in the weapon’s burst area take additional damage equal to your favored ordnance damage.

The damage type of this extra damage is the same as the type normally dealt by the weapon.

Controlled Burst

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to fire your weapon in short, controlled bursts, using only the ammunition needed to take out your target and no more. When you use the burst property with a firearm, you expend only 5 pieces of ammunition instead of 10.

Strafe

At 7th level, when you use the burst property with a firearm, you can create a second 10 foot cube contiguous with the primary burst area within the weapon’s range. If you do, you do not apply your favored ordnance damage to either burst area. For each area you create, you expend 5 pieces of ammunition.

At 16th level, you can create a third burst area. Alternatively, you can reduce your favored ordnance damage to 1d12 to create two burst areas at the ammunition cost of one.

Advanced Tactics

Also at 7th level, you develop advanced tactics that allow you to direct the ebb and flow of battle with your gunfire. You learn one of the following advanced tactics, which you can use to augment the burst areas you create with firearms. You can’t use more than one advanced tactic on your turn. If you use Strafe to create multiple burst areas, the advanced tactic you use (if any) applies to all areas you create.

Cover Fire

When you use the burst property with a firearm, you can choose to exclude a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus from the burst’s effect. All other targets have advantage on the Dexterity saving throw they make to avoid damage from the burst. After the burst’s effect is resolved, the creatures you excluded can use their reaction to move up to half their Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

Focus Fire

When you use the burst property with a firearm, you can choose to create a

5-foot-cube area instead of a 10 foot cube. If you do, targets in the burst take additional damage equal to your favored ordnance damage (an extra 1d8 at 7th level, and extra 1d12 at 11th level, and an extra 2d12 at 16th level). If you use this tactic in conjunction with your Strafe feature, any additional burst areas you create are also 5 foot cubes.

Suppressive Fire

When you use the burst property with a firearm, instead of the burst’s normal effects, you can choose to fill the area with suppressive fire. Each creature in the area makes a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, the creature is rattled and has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the end of your next turn.

Take Cover

At 10th level, you know how to use the shape of the battlefield to shield yourself from incoming fire. The bonuses that cover grants to your AC and saving throws double, increasing to +4 for half cover, and

+10 for three-quarters cover.

Gunfire Maestro

With a gun in your hands, the battlefield is yours to control. At 15th level, you learn all the tactics listed in the Advanced Tactics feature.

Overwhelming Firepower

At 18th level, while wielding a firearm with the burst property, you can use an action to create one of the following effects. To do so, you must expend 10 pieces of ammunition. You can’t use your Strafe or Advanced Tactics features to alter these effects further.

Mow ‘Em Down

Select up to ten contiguous 5 foot cubes you can see within the weapon’s range. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. The target takes the weapon’s normal damage on a failed save, or your favored ordnance damage on a success.

Spray and Pray

Each target in a 60-foot cone makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. The target takes the weapon’s normal damage on a failed save, or your favored ordnance damage on a success.

###### Operative

Some troopers receive more extensive and covert training, acting as special forces deep within enemy territory and completing vital missions. More than footsoldiers, operatives are elite specialists that can accomplish tasks with tact and precision before the enemy is even aware of their presence. These disciplined warriors often keep their contacts long after official military service ends, leading to many to take freelance missions that even officially enlisted wetwork teams won’t touch.

Alpha Strike

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, whenever you hit a surprised target you add an additional favored ordnance damage die.

Armored Stealth

Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Stealth. During a long rest, you can customize even the heaviest suit of armor to make sure it doesn’t hinder your abilities. If you do so, that piece of armor does not give you disadvantage on Stealth checks. Any other creature wearing that same suit of armor still suffers disadvantage on Stealth checks as normal.

Clean Kills

Beginning at 7th level, whenever you make an attack using a weapon with the

long-range or scoped weapon augment, you

ignore the disadvantage normally incurred by firing at a target beyond the weapon’s normal range and you may reroll any favored ordnance die results of 1. In addition, you gain an expertise die on Stealth checks, and while you are hidden any checks made to locate you from 30 or more feet away have disadvantage.

At 16th level, whenever you make an attack using a weapon with the

long-range or scoped weapon augment, any favored ordnance damage dice you would roll instead deal their maximum result.

Infiltration Tactics

Also at 7th level, you develop infiltration tactics that allow you to operate deep within hostile territory. You learn one of the following features.

Dark Ops

You can see normally in darkness to a range of 60 feet. If you already have or gain darkvision from some other source, the range of your darkvision instead increases by 60 feet. In addition, when you are in dim light (or darker) and a weapon attack hits you, you can use your reaction to roll your favored ordnance die, reducing the damage by the result.

Ghost Protocols

Whenever you make a Stealth check and the d20 result is less than 10, your roll is treated as a 10.

Silent Takedown

Whenever you successfully grapple a creature, you can choose to make that grapple silently. When you do, the creature you grapple cannot speak or make any loud noises while it remains grappled. Grapples can be attempted in

this way while hidden. Creatures you grapple while hidden also become hidden, using your Stealth check as its own.

Tactical Reposition

At 10th level you know that a good sniper relocates after every shot. Whenever you make an attack using a weapon that has the long-ranged or scoped weapon augments you can use your reaction to immediately move up to your Speed and take the Hide action.

Phantom Agent

Starting at 15th level, you rarely leave any evidence that an operation took place at all. You learn all the tactics listed in the Infiltration Tactics feature.

Clean Sweep

At 18th level, while wielding a ranged weapon with a long-ranged or scoped weapon augment, you can use an action to expend 5 shots of ammunition in a clean sweep, attacking up to 5 surprised creatures you can see within the weapon’s range, rolling separately for each. When hit, a creature makes a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, it is still surprised at the beginning of the next round.

# Chapter 3: Equipment

As technology advances, the perpetual arms race becomes ever deadlier with new and ingenious ways to both kill and stay alive. This chapter includes a variety of equipment and gear for a voidrunner’s needs, including armor, weapons, vehicles, drones, and even cybernetic enhancements. While many entries in the base game have more modern counterparts here, there are some–such as instruments, artisan’s tools, and the like–that still have application for more technologically advanced heroes.

###### Technology Levels

Science fiction settings depict a wide range of different levels of technology, ranging from the recognizable to the jaw-dropping. Voidrunning technology is divided into two broad categories:

**Standard technology.** These items can reasonably be expected to exist in a wide variety of science fiction settings, and constitute the majority of the gear in this book. Unless otherwise noted, equipment is considered standard technology.

**Advanced technology.** These items tend to be more fanciful, showing up more frequently in full-fledged space opera worlds or as precursor artifacts in more grounded ones. Advanced technologies are often setting-defining items, allowing a few unique wrinkles such as time travel or matter constructors to exist in an otherwise normal world, or for outfitting cultures that are even more advanced than the voidrunners.

In addition to being noted in its entry or properties, an advanced item is also marked with A.

###### Archaic Gear

All non-magical items from the base game are available to voidrunners at double the cost–they are antiques, after all. Availability of such items is at the Narrator’s discretion, and those which are magical in nature are not available unless the game setting includes magic.

Credits and gold pieces are of equal

value.

###### Currency

Everything has a price, and in the future, the standard unit of measuring those prices is the credit, often abbreviated to ‘cr’.

Depending on the nature of the setting, this currency may be a fiat currency, a digital currency, or even one backed by some sort of ‘gold standard’. It may also have a different name.

A typical worker in a prosperous future society earns about 10 credits per day of work.

###### Supply

Supply includes rations, water, basic consumables, minor first aid gear, and power cells. Androids consume Supply in the same way that organic beings do (they drain energy from power cells), and energy weapons use Supply as ammunition.

Supply costs 0.5 cr per Supply.

#### Armor, Shielding, and Weaponry

A soldier’s armor featuring her unit’s distinctive logo, a praetor’s signature blade, the dagger a conman keeps for when a deal goes wrong—characters are often defined by the arms and armaments that they utilize as much as any psychic ability or

well-honed lie. You gain most of your proficiencies from your character class, but your background and culture may mean that

you are capable with other kinds of equipment as well.

Ideally, selecting gear means more than checking off items on a list. A character likely has an association with most of their equipment—they chose a blade instead of a blaster for a reason, after all. Your character’s backstory and personality likely play a key role in this. Did they grow up on the streets and need a well-hidden weapon to get past the authorities, or did they have reason to wear a blade openly? Is a character’s firearm a named and cherished member of the crew, or is it merely a grim tool to take up when there is no other option? Answers to questions like these help define who your character is on and off the battlefield.

##### Weapons

Objects made for killing come in every shape and size. Your class gives you proficiency with certain kinds of weapons, all of which have different properties and ranges. Melee weapons like blades and mauls are held or thrown, while firearms and casters propel ammunition. When making an attack with a weapon, you add either your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the roll, depending on the weapon’s type, as well as your proficiency bonus if you have one. A galaxy’s worth of peoples utilize an equally diverse range of weapons, but most fall into one of five general types: blades, casters, firearms, mauls, and polearms. In addition to the pre-industrial weapons found in the base game, the weapons in this chapter are typically available to voidrunners.

**Simple Weapons.** Direct weapons that require no particular finesse, such as mauls, simple weapons are often wielded by NPCs, who usually lack the training to wield other sorts of weapons. Voidrunners are often proficient with many simple weapons, which include mauls, polearms, and some firearms.

**Martial Weapons.** These weapons require special training and sometimes even exceptional strength to use properly. You must be proficient with a weapon type to gain your proficiency bonus on attack rolls made with it. Unless they have the simple property, the weapons in this chapter are considered martial weapons.

**Starship Weapons.** Weapons mounted on capital ships and starfighters are covered by proficiency in starship weapons.

###### Melee Weapons

While firearms have been widely adopted throughout many cultures, there are still many instances where hand-to-hand combat is preferable, or even unavoidable. Unless otherwise noted, a melee weapon uses your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls.

**Table: Melee Weapons**

***Battle Gauntlet.*** This heavy glove is reinforced with hi-tech materials designed to protect the wearer’s hands and bolster the force of their punches. While wearing a battle gauntlet, you can reach your hand into a hazardous area (such flames or a pool of acid) without suffering any harmful effects. The Narrator may rule that extended exposure to a hazard defeats the gauntlet’s protection, or that the gauntlet offers no protection against certain hazards.

***Combat Chainsaw.*** Unlike the tools designed for industry or personal use, combat chainsaws are meant for war. When you make a damage roll with the weapon, if either of the dice result in a 4, you can roll an additional d4 and add the result to the total damage dealt.

***Combat Knife.*** These simple,

mass-manufactured duranium blades are sturdy and practical, often carried by military forces as a backup weapon.

***Dueling Sword.*** Well-crafted and usually individually designed, dueling swords are often ceremonial–however many cultures still regard hand-to-hand combat as an honorable way to resolve disputes.

***Electro Halberd.*** This polearm sports an electrified blade.

***Longspear.*** A basic weapon, the longspear is a simple duranium shaft tipped with a pointed blade.

***Mono-Whip.*** Spools of monomolecular wire affixed to a thin handle, mono-whips slice neatly through organic and inorganic matter alike.

***Plasma Sword.*** A plasma sword is a superheated blade, reminiscent of a psyknight’s starglaive–although not as potent.

***Shock Mace.*** A medium-sized weapon consisting of a handle ending with a ball or other shaped head. The head is electrified.

***Sonic Maul.*** This heavy hammer delivers a thundering boom when it strikes its target.

***Stun Stick.*** These hand-held devices deliver a powerful electric current that

temporarily disrupts the target’s neuromuscular autonomy. A target damaged by a stun stick makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone and rattled until the end of your next turn. A target that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is stunned instead of rattled.

***Tactical Baton.*** A simple duranium stick with a handle.

***Vibroknife.*** A short blade which emits a high pitched whine capable of dealing sonic damage.

Weapon Slang

Some weapon types have certain colloquial names.

**Burners** are laser weapons which do radiant damage.

**Blasters** are plasma weapons which do fire damage.

**Coolers** are cryo weapons which do cold damage.

**Screechers** are sonic weapons which do thunder damage.

**Shockers** are electro weapons which do lightning damage.

**Sluggers** are weapons which fire physical bullets doing piercing damage.

###### Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons require ammunition to utilize properly. Melee attacks made with ranged weapons are considered to be an attack with an improvised weapon. These weapons use your Dexterity modifier for both attack and damage rolls.

**Table: Ranged Weapons**

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **NAME** | **COST** | **DAMAGE** | **WEIGHT** | **PROPERTIES** |

***Bio-Chakram.*** Bio-chakrams are sharp-edged discs designed to return to the wielder’s hand when thrown. All

bio-chakrams come equipped with the biometric weapon augment. When you make a ranged attack with the

bio-chakram, it returns to your hand whether the attack hits or misses and regardless of what space you are in.

If you are separated from the

bio-chakram by 50 feet or less, you can use a bonus action to call the weapon to your hand. The bio-chakram must be unattended and can’t pass through obstructions such as doors or walls, but you do not need to see the weapon to call it in this way (it flies around corners to reach you, for example).

Whenever you miss with a ranged attack using the bio-chakram, before the weapon returns to your hand, you can use your reaction to make another attack with the weapon against the same target or another target you can see within the weapon’s range.

***Blaster.*** A common weapon and the standard sidearm of many a voidrunner, a blaster is a pistol which fires bolts of plasma.

***Energy Crossbow***. This primitive-looking weapon fires

condensed bolts of energy at the target. It has excellent range, and packs quite a punch.

***Flame Bracer.*** A flame bracer is an anti-personnel weapon designed to be strapped to the user’s forearm. As an action, you can activate the bracer to project a jet of flame in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line takes 2d4 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. If you expend three uses of the flame bracer’s fuel canister, you can alter the area of effect to a 15-foot cone instead.

***Flamethrower.*** Unlike flame bracers, flamethrowers are military-grade weapons that project wide swaths of flame. As an action, you can choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone.

Each creature in that area takes 2d6 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this save is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier.

Unattended flammable objects in the area are ignited.

***Grenade Launcher.*** Grenade launchers allow the wielder to fire a grenade out to the weapon’s maximum range rather than throwing it. Once a grenade lands, it detonates, creating a specific effect depending on the grenade’s type (see Grenades).

***Hypodermic Pistol.*** Hypodermic pistols launch darts equipped with liquid-filled reservoirs. Upon impact, a dart injects the contents of its reservoir into the target.

Assassins typically fill their darts with poison, but the darts can also deliver beneficial substances such as medicine. See the medicine section for more information about the types of substances that can be loaded into a hypodermic pistol.

***Ion Cannon.*** Ion cannons are heavy, two-handed weapons which fire blasts of pure force. Ion cannons have superior range and are highly destructive.

***Jolt Pistol.*** Originally designed for personal protection, jolt pistols fire

short-range arcs of electricity that shock the target’s nervous system. A target damaged by a jolt pistol makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone and rattled until the end of your next turn. A target that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is stunned instead of rattled. Energy batteries designed for shock weapons (see Ammunition) are also used to power jolt pistols.

***Laser Pistol.*** Laser-based firearms fire beams of coherent light at their targets.

***Netcaster.*** Netcasters fire cartridges that break apart mid-flight, deploying a net made of sturdy carbon fiber. A corporeal Large or smaller creature that cannot move through a space one inch or smaller who is hit by ranged attack made with a

netcaster is restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. A net has AC 10, 15 hit points, and is immune to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.

***Pulse Rifle.*** Standard issue military fare, a pulse rifle is an automatic weapon which fires plasma bolts.

***Polaron Gatling Gun.*** Developed for when just plain brute force is required. The weapon is large and bulky and difficult to wield; however it makes up for this by sheer rate of fire and immense destructive power. There are various modes on the gun ranging from a single burst of 10 shots all the way up to 2,000 rounds a minute. The ammunition/power is stored in a backpack worn by the person firing the weapon.

***Shotgun.*** This conventional firearm fires a cartridge of small metal projectiles.

***Slugger.*** A slugger is simply a pistol which fires solid ammunition in the form of bullets. Sluggers predate energy weapons.

***Slug Rifle.*** A slug rifle is an automatic weapon which fires solid ammunition.

***Sniper Rifle.*** A slug rifle designed for long range.

***TK Gauntlet.*** This gauntlet allows the wearer to manipulate the gravity fields surrounding nearby objects. As an action, you can manipulate an unattended object weighing no more than 10 pounds that you can see within 20 feet of you, allowing you to move an object through the air, open or close an unlocked container or door, or perform similar actions. You can’t use the gauntlet to perform complex tasks like wielding a weapon or using hacking tools. The effect ends if the object you are manipulating moves farther than 20 feet away from you.

While you are manipulating an object, you can hurl the object at a target you can see within 20 feet of you, allowing you to make a ranged attack against the

target. This attack normally deals bludgeoning damage, although the Narrator might decide the attack deals a different type of damage, or no damage at all, depending on the nature of the object you are throwing.

***Viper Retainer.*** A viper retainer is designed to fit discreetly inside the wearer’s mouth. All viper retainers come equipped with the concealed weapon augment. While wearing a viper retainer, you can use your tongue to activate the retainer as a bonus action, deploying a spray of poisonous gas at a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus

+ your Dexterity modifier. On a failure, the target takes 1d12 poison damage. Once activated, the expended retainer must be disposed of; inserting a new retainer requires a full minute.

Ammunition

Ranged weapons, such as casters and firearms, require ammunition to fire.

Physical ammunition can be fired only by the type of weapon for which it was designed. When you purchase ammunition (or discover an ammo cache during an adventure), be sure to note the ammunition’s type.

***Energy Batteries.*** Unlike weapons which launch physical projectiles like bolts or bullets, weapons which do energy damage drain charges from batteries or power cells. These charges come from the voidrunnner’s Supply cache–one battery or power cell is equal to 1 Supply and is enough power for 40 shots of a light weapon, 20 shots of a medium weapon, or 10 shots of a heavy weapon.

**Table: Ammunition**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Name** | **Cost** | **Weight** |
| Light, medium, or heavy caster (20) | 1 cr | 1 lb. |
| Pistol, rifle, or cannon | 1 cr | ½ lb. |
| Darts (10) | 1 cr | ½ lb. |
| Fuel canister | 5 cr | ½ lb. |
| Net cartridge | 5 cr | ½ lb. |

###### Weapon Properties

All weapons have special properties that make each of them unique. You can only benefit from these properties if you have proficiency with the weapon. This list also includes properties for vehicle weapons, which are marked with V

***Ammunition.*** This weapon requires ammunition (see above).

***Area Fire***V***.*** Area weapons are usually short-ranged weapons and are almost always a defensive measure, such as flamethrowers, water cannons, and single-use anti-personnel munitions. Area weapons sometimes have non-lethal options.

***Aquatic***V***.*** This weapon property can only be applied to vehicle weapons.

Aquatic weapons, such as torpedoes and depth charges, can only be fired through water or a similar liquid.

***Breaker.*** This weapon deals double damage to unattended objects such as doors and walls.

***Burst Fire.*** In addition to making normal attacks with this weapon, you can use an action to expend 10 pieces of ammunition from the weapon and select a

10-foot-cube area within the weapon’s range. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw against your

maneuver save DC. On a failure, the target takes the weapon’s normal damage.

***Defensive.*** This weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated weight or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using an appropriate shield, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.

***Direct Fire***V***.*** This weapon property can only be applied to vehicle weapons. Direct fire weapons are aimed by pointing the weapon directly at what you want to destroy and firing it. This category includes a wide variety of projectile weapons, directed energy weapons, and rockets. These weapons typically are typically used as either defensive weapons to fend off attacks against a vehicle or as a way of laying down a lot of firepower from the air (in the case of rockets). Rocket-powered direct-fire weapons often have longer ranges than ballistic ones.

***Dual-Wielding.*** This weapon is designed to be wielded in concert with another weapon. When wielding another weapon in your main hand that does not have the heavy property, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with this weapon.

***Exotic.*** Not all weapons fall into neat categories. These miscellaneous weapons have special properties unique to them. Typically, exotic weapons cannot be modified with weapon augments, although the Narrator may allow exceptions for augments that seem particularly appropriate (such as the biometric, concealed, or long-range augments).

***Finesse.*** You may choose to use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

***Guided Fire***V***.*** This weapon property can only be applied to vehicle weapons. Guided weapons are usually missiles or torpedoes. A guided weapon can either be

fired at a specific space like an indirect fire weapon or it can be locked on to a target as an action, which the weapon then automatically attempts to strike (the full lock-on and firing process is handled as a normal weapon attack).

Guided weapons can be targeted at far-off targets if you have an ally mark them or if you have some kind of remote viewing capacity (such as a drone or satellite view or a psionic remote viewing ability).

***Hand-Mounted.*** This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage on saving throws made to resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket or using hacking tools.

***Heavy.*** This weapon is too large for Small creatures to use effectively. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. If a heavy weapon has a Strength requirement (noted in parentheses), even Medium or larger creatures need a Strength score equal to or higher than the requirement to use the weapon effectively. creatures that don’t meet the Strength requirement have disadvantage on attack rolls made with the weapon.

***Indirect Fire***V***.*** This weapon property can only be applied to vehicle weapons. Otherwise known as artillery, indirect fire weapons rely partially on gravity to get their payload to the target by firing in an arc. They are often extremely damaging and frequently have ranges measured in miles, but are slow-firing and most accurate against targets that are either stationary or moving in an extremely predictable way. When targeting something such as a creature or vehicle that has moved in the last round, attacks with indirect fire weapons are made at disadvantage. However, a direct hit is seldom necessary as the most common payloads for these weapons deal area damage.

Indirect fire weapons nearly always have the loading property. Indirect fire weapons can be fired at distant targets if you have an ally mark them or if you have some kind of remote viewing capacity (such as a drone or satellite view or a psionic remote viewing ability). A miss with an indirect fire weapon lands a number of feet away from the target equal to the amount the attack missed by multiplied by 5 (round up to the nearest 5). Roll 1d8 on Indirect Fire Scatter Diagram to determine which direction from the target the ammunition landed.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 8 | TARGET | 4 |
| 7 | 6 | 5 |

***Loading.*** This weapon must be loaded before it can be used. You can make only one attack with a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

***Overkill.*** Only heavy weapons may have the overkill property. These weapons are designed to do massive damage. The attacker activates the overkill setting as part of their attack action, before making their attack roll.The overkill setting allows the weapon to do double damage, but once it has done so it cannot be used again for 1 minute.

***Parrying.*** When you are wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a

single attack made against you by a creature you can see.

***Parrying Immunity.*** Attacks with this weapon ignore the parrying property and Armor Class bonuses from shields.

***Range.*** This weapon fires ammunition. The range lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range.

***Reach.*** This weapon can be used to make attacks against targets within 10 feet. If a weapon has a longer reach, it is stated in parentheses after this property.

***Reload.*** A weapon with this property can fire a number of times equal to the listed value before it must be reloaded. You can reload the weapon as an action, and you must have a free hand to do so.

***Simple.*** This weapon can be used with very little skill or training, and all creatures gain proficiency with it.

***Thrown.*** This weapon can be thrown as a ranged weapon attack. The thrown property lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet?—the first is the weapon’s normal thrown range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range. Additionally, when using this weapon to make a ranged weapon attack, you may choose to use your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage roll.

***Two-Handed.*** You must use two hands to wield this weapon.

***Versatile.*** This weapon may be wielded with one or both hands. If wielded with both hands, it deals the damage listed in parentheses.

Improvised Weapons

Ambushes, bar fights, and attacks made on fancy dress parties mean that the weapon for the job is not always at hand. An improvised weapon is taken from the environment, whether it’s a broken champagne glass, a fifth of alcohol, or even another creature. At the Narrator’s discretion, an improvised weapon that closely resembles a simple weapon deals that weapon’s damage, while an object that has no obvious analog deals 1d4 damage of a type determined by the Narrator.

Improvised thrown weapons have a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet.

###### Explosives

When detonated, explosives such as grenades and mines create a variety of spectacular effects.

Grenades

Grenades are simple, thrown weapons that detonate upon impact. As an action, you can throw a grenade at a point you choose within 30 feet of you. The grenade explodes once it lands, creating an effect determined by its type. Most grenades require creatures caught in their area of effect to make a saving throw. Unless otherwise noted, the DC of this save is equal to your maneuver save DC.

Certain weapons, such as grenade launchers (see Ranged Weapons), allow you to launch grenades longer distances without throwing them.

***Concussion.*** Each creature within 10 feet makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

***EMP.*** Each creature within 10 feet makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, any electronic devices the creature is wearing or carrying cease to function

until the end of the creature’s next turn. Unattended devices in that area automatically fail the save. Constructs in the area also take 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save.

***Flash.*** Each creature within 10 feet makes a Constitution saving throw, and is blinded for 1 minute on a failure. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Foam.*** When detonated, a foam grenade fills a 10-foot-radius sphere with slippery, fire-retardant foam. Open flames in the area when the grenade explodes are immediately extinguished. For the next minute, the ground in the area is difficult terrain. A creature in the affected area or one that enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the area, makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failure.

***Frag.*** Each creature within 5 feet makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Gas.*** When detonated, a gas grenade creates a 10-foot-radius sphere of poisonous gas. A creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn, or that starts its turn inside the cloud, makes a Constitution saving throw. Creatures that don’t need to breathe automatically succeed on the saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour).

***Goo.*** When detonated, a goo grenade fills a 10-foot-radius sphere with a

quick-hardening, adhesive foam. For the next minute, the ground in the area is difficult terrain. A creature in this area makes a Dexterity saving throw, becoming grappled on a failure (escape DC 10).

***Incendiary.*** Each creature within 10 feet makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking

1d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion spreads around corners and ignites unattended flammable objects in the area.

***Remote Detonator.*** When you set a mine, you can link it to a remote detonator, allowing any creature holding the detonator to trigger the mine as an Interact action. Typically, a detonator’s range is limited to 1,000 feet, but a mine connected to a detonator via a computer network can be detonated from essentially any distance.

***Smoke.*** A smoke grenade creates a 10-foot-radius sphere of smoke centered on the point where it detonates. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour).

***Stun.*** Each creature within 10 feet of the grenade when it explodes makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage and is rattled until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is stunned instead of rattled until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t rattled.

Mines

Unlike grenades, which explode shortly after being thrown, mines are designed to detonate once a specific trigger occurs. As an action, you can set a mine in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you.

When you set a mine, determine the circumstances under which the mine will detonate. For example, you can set the mine to detonate on a timer, when a creature enters the mine’s space, or under other specific circumstances (such as when a door opens or a vehicle activates). You can also rig the mine to detonate remotely using a remote detonator (see below).

When detonated, a mine functions identically to the grenade it emulates.

##### Armor

Every spacefarer knows that their suit is the one thing that stands between them and hard vacuum. For some, that’s all it does, but others have turned their suit into a toolbox equipped for their every need; while the most feared combatants are those for whom their suit itself is a weapon. However, such suits are not known for their comfort or maneuverability, and as such many adventurers have multiple sets of armor for different occasions; what may resist hard vacuum is hardly ideal for exploring a verdant alien world, and vice versa.

Your armor’s type is what the majority of the suit is made of, whether that be leather harvested from your homeworld or a high-tech forcefield. Your armor’s type determines your armor class and if your armor is space-proof or not. In addition, your armor’s type may come with certain benefits or drawbacks: forcefields can be hacked, while power armor tends to be bulky and difficult to maneuver in unless you’re strong enough to handle it. Your armor may also have one coating and some also have a number of mod ports as indicated next to its spacefaring property.

Armor Types

With countless cultures throughout the void, there are practically infinite styles of protective gear your characters could be wearing. The following table divides armors by their foundational materials and covers a variety of potential armors your setting might include.

***Aramid Vest.*** An aramid vest is a high-tech series of layers of overlapping synthetic fibers capable of stopping projectiles that covers the torso. Its construction is simpler than hyperweave

or synthweave, at the expense of comfort.

***Canvas.*** Canvas is thick, durable cloth, such as coveralls; it provides limited protection from weapons and projectiles.

***Carbide Plate*.** Carbide Plate is similar to composite armor, but the carbide panels cover the arms and legs as well as the torso and groin.

***Chitin Armor.*** Many planets have monstrous inhabitants covered in durable scales, exoskeleton, or hide. The more daring of adventurers hunt these creatures for sport and profit, turning the spoils into this armor. As such, each set of chitin armor is unique to the creature it is made from and the craftsperson who designed it.

***Composite.*** Composite armor is made of two layers: a durable carbide plate that covers vital areas and an aramid underlayer.

***Composite Mesh.*** Composite mesh is a hyperweave base with metal or ceramic mesh plates covering vital organs.

***Forcefield*.** Some highly developed civilizations have developed wearable devices that generate a forcefield around the wearer. These devices usually comprise a helm or belt and a respirator, which can be incorporated into the rest of the device or take the form of a separate mouthpiece.

***Hyperweave*.** Hyperweave is a denser and heavier form of synthweave, with multiple layers covering vital organs. It is worn by the Fleet’s designated combat units.

***Leather.*** Leather offers more protection than canvas and often takes the form of a vest or duster.

***Polymer.*** Polymer armor is made of a set of comparatively light-weight molded panels that cover the torso and groin.

***Power Armor.*** The most feared warriors of the galaxy wear power armor, designed to reflect all but the most powerful shots and blows. Due to its extreme weight, power armor is equipped with hydraulics to support the wearer’s movement, rendering it easier to move in, if rather slow.

***Riot Armor.*** Heavy but cheap, riot armor is the preferred protection of most security forces. It is typically composed of a standard-issue vest, boots, and helmet.

***Spacesuit.*** While it doesn't offer much in terms of protection, a spacesuit allows the wearer to operate in environments like the vacuum of space.

***Synthweave.*** Synthweave, or synthetic weave, is a polymer-based, tightly-woven fabric. Its subtle stretch and protective capacities make it a comfortable and light-weight option for many spacefarers. It is the standard armament for most members of the Fleet, often being the material of a basic uniform.

Armor Coatings

In addition to its base material, armors can have up to one coating which confers additional benefits. Armor can be recoated, but can only have one coating at a time.

Coating armor takes place over a long rest.

***Camouflage.*** This armor has been patterned to help its wearer blend into the environment. Pick green (swamps, forests, jungles, and the like), brown (deserts, grasslands, and rocky environments), or gray (industrial) camouflage. You gain an expertise die to Stealth checks while wearing camouflaged armor crafted for the terrain you are in.

***Cloaking.*** This armor has

pseudo-field-generators built into its surface. You gain an expertise die to Stealth checks made to hide in any terrain. If the armor is damaged, this coating ceases to function until it is repaired.

***Cold-Shielding.*** While wearing this armor, you gain an expertise die to checks made to survive extreme cold.

***Greased.*** This armor has a slippery coating that makes it difficult for opponents to grab onto you. You gain an expertise die to saving throws made to avoid being grappled.

***Heat-Shielding.*** While wearing this armor, you gain an expertise die to checks made to survive extreme heat.

***Mirrored.*** This armor has a shiny, reflective coating. If an attacker rolls a natural 1 with a single-target attack which does radiant damagewhen you are the target of the attack, the attack rebounds upon the attacker.

***Shear-Thickening.*** This armor provides some of its protection from small silicon particles suspended in a fluid that hardens when struck, providing easier mobility while still protecting from fast-moving projectiles. The Strength requirement for this armor is reduced by 1.

***Spikes.*** This armor has barbs built into its surface. A creature that begins its turn grappling you takes 1d4 piercing damage while you are wearing this armor.

Armor Mods

Many more expensive armors have one or more mod ports, circuitry and connectors that allow for easy modifications and upgrades. Mods purchased for armor are typically installed as part of the cost, but armor mods can be added or removed during a long rest.

***Biosensors.*** This mod tracks the wearer’s vitals at all times. As a reaction, you may reduce the damage of an attack against you by 2d6. Once you have done so, you must perform Maintenance on the armor to use this ability again.

***Drone Port.*** This mod provides a place to store and charge a **utility drone** (you must acquire this drone separately but any variety of utility drone may utilize your drone port). Drones you charge using this port are connected to inbuilt comms in your armor and you can command such drones through voice commands over a distance up to 1 mile with no action required. If you command your drone to attack however it requires your action and the drone’s reaction. If your drone’s signal is ever jammed it does its best to return to your last known location.

***Environmental Recycling.*** This mod captures lost fluids and scrubs carbon dioxide from its internal environment.

Armor equipped with this mod can provide you with oxygen and water for up to 48 hours. These hours are restored when maintenance is performed on the armor.

***Floodlights.*** As an action, you can enable or disable bright lights mounted on your shoulders. The floodlights shed bright light in a 30 foot cone and dim light for another 30 feet..

***Glider Wings.*** You can extend your arms and glide on hyperweave sails. While doing so, you fall at a rate of 60 feet per round rather than 200 and can move a

corresponding distance in any direction laterally. If you take any other action while gliding in this way, such as attacking or casting a spell, you make a DC 15 Acrobatics check or overbalance and begin falling. When falling, you can activate your glider wings as a reaction by succeeding on a DC 10 Acrobatics check.

***Grappling Hook.*** This hook is mounted to your back connected to a high tensile line. As an action, you can make a ranged attack with the grappling hook, which has a range of 30/80 and deals 1d4 piercing damage and sticks to the surface, object, or creature hit. The attached line has an AC of 18 and has 20 hit points. The grappling hook can be detached at the hook as an action with a DC 10 Athletics check.

***Ground Anchors.*** As a bonus action, you can drive your boots into the ground. You cannot move until you take an action to retract the anchors, but you gain advantage on all checks and saves made to resist being moved from your spot. If you are moved anyway, the ground anchors automatically retract.

***Hazmat Sealing.*** This suit is resistant to the effects of radiation and provides advantage on saving throws made to resist radiation.

***Improved Cold-Shielding.*** This mod takes the form of heavy insulation to protect from the coldest temperatures. You make checks to survive extreme cold at advantage and can use your reaction to reduce cold damage you take by 1d6 + your proficiency bonus.

***Improved Heat-Shielding.*** Suits with this mod are specially designed to reflect heat outwards, away from vital organs and processing units. You make checks to survive extreme heat at advantage and can use your reaction to reduce fire damage you take by 1d6 + your proficiency bonus.

***Improved Weapon Hatch.*** When you choose this mod, pick a weapon. The hatch is designed to hold that weapon. In addition, you may use the weapon while it is embedded in your armor. Attempts to

Disarm you have disadvantage, and you have your wielding hand free. If the weapon requires two hands, you still must use your non-wielding hand when making an attack.

***Integrated First Aid.*** This kit can contain up to ten small single-use biomechs that can provide limited first aid. As an action, you can deploy one of the biomechs and regain 2d4+2 hit points.

***Integrated Jetpack.*** As a bonus action, you can activate this mod to gain a flying speed of 30 feet for the duration of your turn. If you end your turn still in the air and are in gravity, you immediately fall.

***Integrated Tool.*** When you choose this mod, pick a tool. The tool or piece of equipment cannot be Bulky. The hatch is designed to hold that tool and you can use a tool integrated in this way with only command inputs and without the use of your hands.

***Kinetic Assistance.*** Hydraulics or small jets enhance your movement. While wearing a suit with this mod, your base speed increases by 5 feet.

***Mass Jammer.*** As an action, you may activate or deactivate the mass jammer. While the jammer is active, any hacking attempts remove both 5s and 6s from the hacking countdown pool. The mass jammer covers you and anything within 10 feet of you. While this jammer is active, comms and computing devices are inoperable while they are within 10 feet of you.

***Mindshielding*.** This mod grants an expertise die on saves to resist being charmed, frightened, and against any psionic powers from the empathic or telepathic mental disciplines.

***Nightvision Goggles.*** When you have this mod equipped, you can see in darkness as if it were dim light up to a range of 60 feet. If you have darkvision, you instead see through darkness as if it were bright light up to a range of 60 feet, and as if it were dim light for a further 60 feet.

***Personal Jammer***. As an action, you may activate or deactivate the jammer.

While the jammer is active, any hacking attempts made against any item on your person remove both 5s and 6s from the hacking countdown pool. While this jammer is active you cannot utilize any comms or computing devices.

***Pocket.*** The humble pocket is often overlooked, but its usefulness cannot be overstated. A pocket is typically large enough to fit a small book or a single ration.

***Power Claw.*** This gauntlet is equipped with retractable blades and hydraulics.

You gain advantage on Athletics checks made to climb or hold things. In addition, you can use a bonus action to activate the blades, increasing your basic melee damage to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. While the blades are activated, the power claw has no other effects and that hand cannot be used for other tasks. The blades can be retracted as a bonus action.

***Recharge Port.*** This port is designed to recharge force shields. When a force shield is plugged in, it recharges in one minute without requiring an Engineering check.

***Recon Apparatus.*** When you have this mod equipped, you double the distance you can see. When making ranged attacks at long range, you do not have disadvantage on the roll.

***Repair Kit.*** This mod is a small pouch containing ten uses of emergency suit repair supplies. As an action, you may spend one of those uses and make a DC10 Engineering check to repair a Damaged spacesuit.

***Secondary Armor Plating.*** Suits with this mod have detachable additional plates. Armor with this mod grants you 20 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points can only be replenished by performing maintenance on the armor and the plates are destroyed when these temporary hit points ever reach 0. As a bonus action, you can detach these plates and discard them. If you do so while you are flying or in zero g, you gain an

additional 15 feet of movement for that turn.

***Weapon Hatch.*** When you choose this mod, pick a weapon. The hatch is designed to hold that weapon, like a traditional sheath.

Spacefaring Armor

Spacefaring armor includes small thrusters, which can be used for maneuvering in

zero-G environments, and magnetic boots to allow for walking or grabbing onto ships and gear. These magnets can be engaged or disengaged as a bonus action or reaction. Spacefaring armor always includes a full-coverage helm which allows the wearer to breathe in the void for up to one hour.

usually all that is required to alter a suit of armor to fit a new wearer of the same size category. Changing an armor’s size category requires a repair check; armor can only decrease in size category.

Most armors, while protective, are not comfortable to sleep in. If you sleep in your armor, you regain half the number of hit dice and if you have any levels of fatigue or strife, they are not reduced following your long rest. Armor with the comfortable property negates this penalty, allowing you to regain hit dice and remove fatigue and strife as normal.

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.

***Don.*** This is the time it takes to put on armor. Your Armor Class is only increased by armor that you have fully donned.

***Doff.*** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

Hacking Armor and Mods

Armor with the hackable property can be hacked, following the rules for a contested hack. If armor is the target of the hack, the creature wearing it is treated as if it were the device for the purpose of hacking maneuvers.

##### Shields

Shields have come a long way since medieval times, and while putting a big sturdy slab in between yourself and danger is still a valid tactic, many combatants choose to utilize forcefields which envelope the wielder in a protective barrier. Despite these advancements, timing their projection to coincide with oncoming danger without draining power still takes training and attention. The shields presented here are still regarded as traditional shields for the purposes of proficiency requirements, can still be used for a shield sacrifice, and require a free hand to don and utilize.

***Breaching Shield.*** This shield gives you a +2 to your AC and adds an expertise die to your Maneuver DC when you attempt to Shove another creature.

**TABLE: SHIELDS**

***Duranium Shield.*** Shields made of duranium are similar to those used hundreds of years ago, albeit lighter.

***Force Shield.*** A force shield is generated from a wrist-mounted shield generator and can absorb a limited amount of damage before it needs to recharge. The size of the shield determines how many temporary hit points it grants, as seen in Table: Shields. It takes a short rest for a force shield to recharge.

**Riot Shield.** This shield gives you a +2 to your AC and an expertise die on saves made to resist being shoved.

|  |  |  |  |

| **SHIELD** | **PRICE** | **WEIGHT** | **PROTECTION** |
| Breeching shield | 75 cr | 12 lbs. | +2 AC, expertise die to maneuver DC for Shoves |

#### Voidrunning Gear

Weapons and armor are not all there is to survival—effective medical care, reliable communication, or the right cyberware at the right time can all mean the difference between living to share stories at the end of the day or being sent home in a small box. While most of the items found in the base game are still available if one knows where to look, many of them have modernized versions listed here. The following section describes general and specialized gear commonly used by voidrunners.

###### Clothing

It is assumed that all voidrunners have basic clothing, or the uniform of an origanization to which they belong. For those who wish to spend a little more, the following options are available.

**Table: Clothing**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CLOTHING** | **CO ST** | **WEIGH T** |
| Basic or uniform | — | 2 lbs. |
| Costume | 5 cr | 4 lbs. |
| Fine | 15  cr | 6 lbs. |
| Noble | 50  cr | 6 lbs. |

Technology advancements do not bypass the humble garment, and never had.

Throughout time people have sought to make their clothing more suited to the way they live their lives, and with the improvement of technology, more specialized garments emerge.

***Diver’s Suit.*** This kit includes a wetsuit, swim fins, an oxygen tank, and a diving mask with rebreather. It allows a diver to stay submerged for an hour before

needing to change oxygen tanks and gives them advantage on Athletics checks related to swimming. Light armor can be worn with a diving suit, without issue but medium armor tends to make swimming exhausting, requiring a DC 13 Constitution save every minute to avoid gaining a level of fatigue. Heavy armor generally sinks the character wearing it, rendering swimming impossible.

***Ghillie Suit.*** Favored by snipers and others highly-reliant on stealth in natural surroundings, a ghillie suit is made up of shaggy-looking fabric strips hanging from a mesh suit. It makes the wearer look like a pile of loose vegetation when still. A ghillie suit only works in the environment it was designed for, but in that environment, it grants advantage on Stealth checks. It is worn over armor.

***Optic Camouflage Cloak.*** This hooded cloak contains an array of sensors and a fiber optic mesh that mimics the look of whatever the user is standing in front of. It does not grant true invisibility, but the wearer has advantage on Stealth checks based on sight and can use the Hide action even when directly observed. The user has a passive Stealth score of 17 even in open environments and bright light as long as the cloak is active. It is worn over armor.

***Tactical Clothing.*** Favored by militaries, emergency services personnel, and field repairmen alike, this clothing comes in a variety of colors and camouflage patterns and has a large number of convenient pockets to keep equipment in. A camouflaged version grants an expertise die to Stealth checks in a corresponding terrain type. It includes pants and a shirt worn underneath armor and a vest which fits over body armor, allowing the wearer to keep up to 8 lbs of items with individual weights of no more than 1 lb. easy at hand. Retrieving an item stored this way can be done as a bonus action or action.

###### Communications and Computing

Arguably the key technologies of not only the modern world, but most science fiction ones as well, communications and computing are all about data: generating, transmitting, interpreting, manipulating, storing, and concealing it as the need arises.

***Data Wafer.*** Data wafers are miniature storage devices about the size of a fingernail. The standard capacity is 1 petabyte. Holders in the forms of rings, pendants, and other jewelery are often used to avoid losing them.

***Personal Communicator (ICD).*** Individual communication devices are very common in most societies. A typical device allows its user to communicate by video, audio, or through text, can connect to whatever society-wide network exists, and runs a selection of useful programs. A personal communicator is typically a small device controlled with hand gestures, but it may take the form of a heads-up device that combines a monocle or visor with an earpiece, a wristwatch, or even a badge worn as a pin on the lapel.

***Portable Computing Device (PCD).*** These devices are designed for scenarios where a larger viewable area and/or a bit more processing power than an ICD is desirable. They may be a folding device with a separate keyboard or other control panel and screen, or they may look like a giant ICD (this latter type is sometimes referred to as a datapad). In some worlds, they may also be worn on the arm,

generating a user interface out of projected light that can be interacted with by multiple appendages at once.

***Signal Jammer.*** These devices interfere with the signals generated by wireless networks of various types. Signal jammers are usually found in the possession of militaries and clandestine organizations, but criminals, security services, and hackers employ them as well. The listed cost is for a small version that fits in a backpack or briefcase, but larger ones that require vehicles or even towers to employ also exist. The portable version covers roughly 4 city blocks, making it impossible to get a wireless network signal in or out of the area while it is active. Setting the jammer up takes a minute. Once it is set up, activating or deactivating it takes an action.

***Workstation Computing Device (WCD).*** Dispensing with portability entirely, these larger-scale computers are used on desktops or ship’s terminals.

They have a lot of processing power and are favored by those who need it like engineers, programmers, gamers, hackers, and those responsible for creating media such as video and music.

| **ITEM** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** |
| Data Wafer | 2 cr | — |
| Personal Communicator | 50 cr | — |
| Portable Computing Device (PCD) | 75 cr | 2 lbs. |
| Signal Jammer | 250 cr | 10 lbs. |
| Workstation Computing Device (WCD) | 200 cr | 20 lbs. |

###### Containers

Containers don’t change much in their shapes and sizes as technology advances, but they do get lighter, stronger, and sometimes less expensive. Containers marked with \* are ruggedized, with an AC of

15 and 30 hit points, and shield their contents in a hard vacuum.

**Table: Containers**

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ITEM** | **CAPACITY** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** |
| Backpack | 60 lbs of gear or 2 cubic feet | 10 cr | 3 lbs. |

| Storage crate | 300 lbs of gear or 12 cubic feet | 10 cr | 10 lbs. |
| Tactical case\* | 50 lbs of gear or 2 cubic feet | 25 cr | 5 lbs. |

###### Drones

From tiny friendly orbs to autonomous death machines, drones are simple mechanized creatures that dutifully carry out their digital orders. They may be shiny and new fresh from the package, or they may be sentinel drones patrolling long-abandoned facilities on forgotten worlds, collecting data for creators that no longer exist.

Most drones are linked to an accompanying device, typically a datapad or a wrist mounted data screen that acts as the drone’s control device that requires the use of a free hand to operate. A creature wielding a drone’s control device can use a bonus action to command the drone to perform a simple action such as “attack”, “scout and report back”, or other easily processed tasks which it does to the best of its ability on its next turn in initiative which is always immediately after its controller’s initiative.

If a drone’s control device is destroyed (AC 14, 10 hit points) or the signal between a drone and its control device is jammed the drone becomes confused as per its malfunction feature.

Equipment, such as armor and drone ports, and some class features may

alter the nature of a drone’s control, such as allowing for actionless verbal commands or other benefits or alterations to drone controlling. The statistics for all drones are detailed in the Alien Bestiary.

**Table: Drones**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ITEM** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** |
| Utility drone | 50 cr | 2 lbs. |

###### General Gear

Technological equipment, vehicles, and even beings need to be maintained and built, and those with the knowledge—and implements—to do so have a hand in shaping the future.

***Construction Foam.*** An industrial “spray concrete,” industrial foam comes in a heavy canister or drum and is deployed with a special sprayer. It is semi-solid and shapeable for about 5 minutes after spraying. Once it fully sets after an hour, it becomes a durable stone-like material. A

1. foot thick (cubic) section of construction

foam has an AC of 15 and 40 hit points, but only weighs 10 lbs, roughly 1/15th of the weight of concrete. It is waterproof and takes no damage from cold, fire, acid, poison, or lightning. In industrial applications, it is usually transported via truck. Price and weight are for a smaller backpack applicator that creates 6 cubic feet of the foam.

***Duct Tape.*** This heavy-duty, airtight, water-resistant tape has a multitude of uses. You can use 3 feet for emergency repairs to clothing, containers, mechanical creatures, or armor, removing the broken condition for 1d8 days. However, if the user suffers a critical hit before the item can be properly repaired, or something else would impose the broken condition on the item, the item

re-breaks and cannot be repaired with duct tape again until properly repaired. You can also use 6 feet of the tape and an action to restrain a medium-sized creature (as zip cuffs), 1 foot to blind a restrained creature until an action is spent to remove the tape, and 1 foot to render a restrained creature unable to speak until an action is spent to remove the tape. A restrained creature’s airway can also be covered with 1 foot of the tape, causing it to begin suffocating until an action is spent to remove the tape. You can use 12 feet of the tape to secure a restrained creature to a chair or other stationary object, imposing disadvantage on checks to escape its restraints.

***Earplugs.*** These small, comfortable foam plugs fit into the ear canal of most humanoids. They grant advantage on saving throws to avoid being stunned or deafened by loud noises, but disadvantage on hearing-based Perception checks.

***Multitool.*** A small folding toolkit designed to be clipped to a pocket or carried in a pouch, a multitool usually has pliers, screwdrivers, and a knife blade at a minimum. You can use it for vehicle repair or in place of weaponsmith toolkits, but such checks suffer a –1d4 penalty and take twice as long.

***Notebook.*** Notebooks of various shapes and sizes are still useful—and inexpensive—in the age of digital media.

***Pen.*** Available in a basic, extremely inexpensive variety and a version that works in zero gravity but costs much more, pens are the standard writing utensil of most Voidrunners.

***Spray Adhesive.*** An incredibly strong glue that bonds virtually anything solid to anything else solid. The underlying structures typically give way before the glue does. It comes with a canister of solvent that dissolves a square foot of adhered area in 1 minute. A single spray canister is good for 50 uses. A creature glued to a surface can rip free, taking 1d8 slashing damage in the process.

***Spray Paint.*** Used primarily for painting furniture, machine parts, and so on, spray paint is also used for graffiti and street or vehicle art and can blind creatures and cameras alike. It can be sprayed at a creature or camera within 10 feet. Cameras are automatically blinded until the paint is cleaned off (requiring 2 actions). Creatures make a saving throw against the attacker's maneuver DC. Creatures that fail are blinded for 1 round if unprotected, or until 2 actions are spent to clean the lenses or visor of whatever eye or face protection they are wearing. A canister has 5 uses.

Luminescent varieties exist that cast dim light within 5 feet of the area they are applied to; they cost twice as much.

***Zero-friction Lubricant.*** A

super-slick sprayed compound, Zero-friction lubricant can make any surface incredibly slippery. It doesn’t quite remove *all* friction (the name is hyperbole) but any creature attempting to cross a surface coated with the lubricant or hold onto an item sprayed with it makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw each round. Failing the save results in the creature falling prone (and needing another check at the same DC to stand up or move from their position) in the case of a surface or drop the item in the case of an item. Spraying a grappling creature with the lubricant gives advantage on checks to escape a grapple. A spray canister contains enough lubricant to cover 25 square feet.

Spraying a creature or 5 foot square takes an action.

**Table: Tools**

###### Jetpacks

They’re dangerous and impractical, but still the dream of freeform personal flight has always been a technological penultimate goal. Unless otherwise noted, the jetpacks provided here can be worn alongside light or medium armors, but do not provide enough lift for takeoff when wearing heavy armors. For most adventures jetpacks are assumed to function as intended without concerns for fuel. If your campaign is utilizing desperate supply rules, instead each jetpack can function for up to an hour on a full fuel tank and can be refilled at the cost of 25 cr.

***Anti-Grav Pack/Boots.*** An ultra-tech descendent of the standard jetpack, an Anti-Grav pack uses antigravity technology to maneuver. The user is surrounded by a very lightweight protective field while the pack is active (AC becomes 12 if it would otherwise be lower) which protects the user from the high winds and allows much faster flight speeds. An Anti-Grav pack grants its user a flight speed of 60 feet. Another variant

that uses boots or anklets also exists; it works in the same manner. This is an advanced item.

***Covert Ops Jetpack.*** A military variant of the standard jetpack that incorporates a set of broad, retractable glider wings covered in stealth compound. The pack provides its user a fly speed of 25 feet.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Item** | **Cost** | **Weight** |
| Construction foam | 150 cr | 60 lbs. |
| Duct Tape (60 feet) | 2 cr | — |
| Earplugs | .5 cr | — |
| Multitool | 75 cr | ½ lb. |
| Notebook | 1 cr | — |
| Pen (basic) | .10 cr | — |
| Pen (zero-g) | 30 cr | — |
| Spray adhesive | 8 cr | ½ lb. |
| Spray paint (5 uses) | 1.25 cr | ½ lb. |
| Zero-friction lubricant | 75 cr | ½ lb. |

While the user is at an altitude of at least 100 feet in atmosphere, they can activate the glider wings and stay aloft mostly by gliding, using only small pulses from the jetpack to stay aloft. While gliding, you have a passive Stealth score of 10 + your Stealth bonus and you can hide in the sky without any obstacles to hide behind. At night or in space, you also receive an expertise die to Stealth checks while aloft.

***Jet Boots.*** A favorite of daredevils, jet boots essentially integrate a jetpack into two large, heavy boots. While wearing the jet boots, your walking speed is reduced by 5 feet and you make Stealth checks at disadvantage, but you have a fly speed of 30 feet. You can also make a jet blast attack with the boots. They are considered an improvised weapon, and deal 3d6 fire damage with a reach of 10 feet.

***Improved Jetpack.*** A technological development of a standard jetpack, these improved models eliminate many of the risks and provide higher speeds. This pack grants the user a fly speed of 25 feet. These jetpacks are designed to integrate with cybernetics or an armor’s system, allowing hands-free operation.

This is an advanced item.

***Microgravity Maneuver Pack.*** Designed specifically for precision movement in space, this maneuver pack has a large number of small but precise thrusters across its entire surface. It allows a user to make incredibly exacting movements in space or in other microgravity situations. The user gains a fly speed of 20 feet while in a zero-g environment, and has both advantage *and* an expertise die on Acrobatics checks made to maneuver in such environments.

***Military Ducted Fan Flightpack.*** A heavy- duty pair of powerful ducted fans

attached to an armor-plated power pack, this flight system can function even with large-sized creatures and creatures wearing heavy armor, granting them a fly speed of 25 feet. It can be operated by one hand using a small handheld control stack.

***Standard Jetpack.*** This device is what most people think of when they imagine a jetpack. A pair of turbines or chemical rockets worn like a backpack that can be operated by one hand using a small handheld control stack. creatures who roll a natural 1 for any attack, check, or saving throw while airborne using the jetpack take 2d6 points of fire damage as they accidentally stick some body part directly in the exhaust stream. It grants the user a fly speed of 300 feet, or 30 miles per hour.

**Medicine**

Advanced medicine is another hallmark of many science fiction settings, with medical technology and procedures that can cure many ailments and injuries. In addition to the standard medical pouch (see tools) the following drugs and other items are available.

Drugs

Voidrunners often benefit from the better living chemistry provides. Whether they are used to heal, harm, or anything in between, drugs can be administered physically, orally, or via airhypo as an action.

***Anti-G Cocktail.*** Administered to pilots and passengers on aircraft and spacecraft executing high-g maneuvers, these injected drugs are unpleasant, but potentially life-saving. A user gains an expertise die on saving throws for starship maneuvers, but also takes 1d4 poison damage. A dose lasts for 10 minutes. The delivery system is typically integrated into a vehicle seat, where it can be activated with the user’s reaction in response to starting a maneuver. If it needs to be administered manually with an airhypo, it takes an action.

***Anti-Rad.*** Anti-rad flushes radiation from a creature’s body. A dose is administered via airhypo as an action and takes 10 minutes to take effect, but then immediately flushes all radiation from the patient’s body. The process is exhausting, and leaves the patient with two levels of fatigue.

***Gullibility Serum.*** This drug, administered via ingestion or injection, makes the victim extremely trusting. The victim makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or Persuasion checks made against the target have advantage for the next hour.

***Quick-Sober Patch.*** This is a small drug patch about an inch square that can be applied to any exposed skin as an action. It takes effect in one minute, immediately ending the effects of alcohol and similar “soft” drugs on the user once the minute has passed. Poisons with a save DC of less than 13 are simultaneously neutralized in the patient’s system, and the user gains an immediate saving throw at advantage against poisons with a DC of 13 or higher.

***Smelling Salts.*** Available in several different forms (crystals, a solution, etc.) when the fumes from smelling salts are inhaled by a creature, they immediately become more alert. Unconscious creatures make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, and on a success, regain consciousness. creatures that are already conscious can ignore the effects of one

level of fatigue for up to 10 minutes. Overuse of smelling salts can be dangerous. For every dose beyond the first in a 24-hour period, a creature makes a constitution saving throw of DC 11 + 1 per dose beyond the first. A creature that fails takes 1d4 points of poison damage.

***Styx.*** A potent memory-erasing drug, Styx forces a creature exposed to it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or forget the last hour of their life. It can be injected or ingested. Multiple doses extend further back, and it is possible to wipe out weeks or even months of a creature’s memory with repeated or large doses. If a creature is subjected to additional doses within 1 hour of failing this saving throw, they must repeat the saving throw, losing an additional 1d4 days of memory on a failed save.

***Synthetic Adrenaline.*** Typically used as a combat drug, but sometimes used recreationally, synthetic adrenaline gives the user advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saves for one minute. Once the effect ends, the user immediately gains two levels of fatigue. It can only be injected.

***Truth Serum.*** A drug used by interrogators, a victim injected with truth serum makes a DC 17 Constitution save and on a failed save is unable to lie for an hour, and remaining silent or vague when asked questions requires a separate DC 14 Wisdom saving throw for each question asked.

***Universal Airhypo.*** Can be used to administer a dose of any injected drug to the user or a willing or restrained creature as an action.

Injury Treatment

Futuristic science has produced a variety of items to help voidrunners live to see another day.

***Antiseptic (5 uses).*** Once applied, this fresh-smelling cream can keep a wound moist and prevent infection for more effective healing. You can apply an antiseptic as an action. When a

non-synthetic creature treated with an antiseptic takes a short rest, they roll a bonus hit die and add the result to the total number of hit points regained from the rest. Once a creature benefits from an antiseptic, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest.

***Blood-Stop Bandage.*** These highly durable and stretchy strips are clear to better allow monitoring of a wound’s condition. Additionally, they are coated with a coagulant to help them staunch bleeding. You can use an action to apply a blood-stop bandage to yourself or another creature to end ongoing piercing or slashing damage. When using improvised bandages, such as torn clothing, there is a 50% chance of exposure to a disease.

Synthetic lifeforms such as androids can benefit fully from this healing, as it prevents the leakage of critical fluids.

***First Aid Kit (15 uses).*** This kit includes all the basic materials you need to staunch bleeding and start treatment of wounds. As an action, you can expend one use of this item to stabilize a

non-synthetic creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check.

***Medical Gel.*** A highly-active slurry of stem cells and various beneficial drugs, medical gel is the ultimate in combat medicine. A single dose, when administered topically, heals 4d6 hit points. It is expensive, but used widely by

military units. Synthetic lifeforms such as androids cannot benefit from this healing. This is an advanced item.

***Nanopatch.*** An adhesive fabric bandage infused with nanomachines. When applied to a wound as an action, the nanomachines clean out debris and dead cells, and apply an antiseptic/analgesic compound. The patient recovers 1d6 hit points. Synthetic lifeforms such as androids can benefit fully from this healing.

***Nanobot Compound.*** A vial of gray goo that is actually millions of tiny medical nanomachines. These nanomachines can be drunk or applied directly onto a wound as an action. The patient recovers 1d4+4 hit points and in addition, they also gain 4 temporary hit points as the lingering active nanomachines quickly work to repair new injuries. Synthetic lifeforms such as androids can benefit fully from this healing.

***Sedative.*** This calming solution can ease mental pain. When a non-synthetic creature is administered this drug, it a recovers level of strife. Roll 1d10. On a 1, it gains a short-term mental stress effect. Once a creature benefits from a sedative, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest.

**Table: Injury Treatment**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ITEM** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** |
| Antiseptic (5 uses) | 7.5 cr | — |
| Blood-Stop Bandage | .1 | — |
| First Aid Kit (15 uses) | 15 cr | 2 lbs. |
| Medical gelA | 250 cr | 1/2 lb. |
| Nanopatch | 30 cr | — |
| Nanobot compound | 80 cr | — |
| Sedative | 3.5 cr | — |

Medical Technology Advancements

Medications and first aid supplies advance rapidly as technology improves, but the desired effects often remain the same. The

following table details items that have supplanted those found in the base game. Unless otherwise noted, these items are administered by airhypo or pill, either by the patient or another creature, as an action.

Expertise dice granted by the use of medicine can only be gained from that type of medicine once between long rests.

***Anti-Inhibitor.*** This reddish liquid fills you with confidence. After injecting it, you gain an expertise die on Charisma saving throws for 2 hours.

***Cognitive Enhancer.*** This amber liquid helps sharpen focus. After injecting this compound you gain an expertise die on Intelligence saving throws for 2 hours.

***Immune Booster.*** This dark liquid boosts your immune system. After injecting it, you gain an expertise die on Constitution saving throws for 2 hours.

***Steroid.*** This iron-gray liquid increases a patient’s physical prowess. After injecting it, you gain an expertise die on Strength saving throws for 2 hours.

***Stimulant***. This cloudy solution heightens the senses. After injecting it, you gain an expertise die on Wisdom saving throws for 1 hour.

***Reflex Enhancer.*** This bright blue liquid improves reaction time. After injecting it, you gain an expertise die on Dexterity saving throws for 2 hours.

**Table: Medical Technology Advancements**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ITEM** | **COST** | **WEIGHT** |
| Anti-Inhibitive | 5 cr | — |
| Cognitive Enhancer | 5 cr | — |
| Immune Booster | 10 cr | — |
| Steroid | 10 cr | — |
| Stimulant | 10 cr | — |
| Reflex Enhancer | 10 cr | — |

Synthetic Repair

The unique conditions of androids (and other synthetic lifeforms) mean that their

injuries must be treated differently than most humanoids. In addition to any treatments that are specified to work on their constructed physique, any injectable substance listed under Medical Technology Advances has an equivalent that can usually be purchased at a cost increase of 50% of the original price, taking the form of short-term programs that act in nearly identical ways.

Additionally, there are the following

items:

***Patch Kit (15 uses).*** This kit includes all the basic materials you need to regulate a construct’s systems, staunch the loss of critical fluids, and begin repair. As an action, you can expend one use of this item to stabilize a synthetic lifeform that has 0 hit points, without needing to make an Engineering check.

***Repair Kit.*** The professional version of a patch kit, repair kits are most useful to those with formal engineering training.

Any creature can expend one use to stabilize a dying artificial lifeform without the need for an Engineering check.

However, creatures with proficiency in Engineering can spend a use of the kit to greater effect. When a creature proficient in this skill makes an Engineering check with the kit to stabilize a synthetic lifeform, the synthetic lifeform recovers 1d6 hit points for every 5 full points the DC of the check is exceeded by (1d6 on a result of 15, 2d6 on a result of 20, etc.). This DC is 10 in most cases, except in the case of especially complicated or severe damage. The kit can be used 5 times before being depleted. Replacement supplies cost 50 credits per use.

TABLE: SYNTHETIC REPAIR ITEMS

**Item Cost Weight Patch Kit** 50 cr 5 lbs.

**Repair Kit** 300 cr 15 lbs.

###### Psionic Foci

Whether they are synthetic gems, symbols imbued with psionic power, or carefully knotted cords that encourage mindful

concentration, psionic foci are items that allow creatures with psionic abilities to concentrate on two powers. Their rarity and cost can vary greatly from planet to planet. Cyberware that serves as a psionic focus can be found under Enhancement Implants below.

A psionic focus allows a creature to concentrate on more than one psionic power simultaneously as long as the sum of the powers’ levels is less than or equal to their power rating. If the manifester’s concentration is disrupted, such as if they are pushed or take damage, they roll for both powers individually. Both powers’ effects still end early if the manifester is killed or incapacitated.

**Table: Psionic Foci**

**Item Cost Weight**

Knotted Focus 150 cr — Synthetic Crystal 200 cr 3 lbs Imbued Emblem 225 cr —

Psychic Crystals

Crystals, gems, and precious stones have long been used as shiny adornments, for healing rituals, and as valued treasures. But there are some naturally occurring crystals that resonate at a frequency with which psionic minds can interact, allowing them to work as psionic foci. The Narrator determines the rarity and availability of such crystals within your campaign setting, but they are likely coveted treasures.

###### Security Gear

Police, soldiers, spies, and similar professions are frequently thought of mostly in terms of weapons and armor, but there is a lot of other specialized equipment in the arsenal of these types of professionals.

***Binoculars.*** A good pair of binoculars comes in handy in a variety of situations. They can give the user a clear view of targets up to a quarter-mile away in bright or dim light. An additional 100 credits adds a night vision mode, which allows the user to see at the same range in

darkness. The user has advantage on sight-based Perception checks dealing with faraway targets (up to half a mile). ***Bug.*** Tiny clandestine surveillance devices are often referred to as “bugs.”

They are about the size of a grain of rice (DC 22 Investigate check to locate) and can pick up ambient conversation in an area up to 20 feet from their location and transmit it over an encrypted datastream up to a mile. Video-capable versions cost twice as much.

***Bug Detector.*** A small handheld device for locating bugs. Using a bug detector automatically detects the presence (but not location) of transmitting bugs within 20 feet of you, and grants advantage on Investigation checks to find them.

***Chemical Light Stick.*** A heatless chemical flare activated by cracking an internal seal, which mixes two chemicals together causing a luminescent chemical reaction. Can be activated as an action, after which it provides bright light in a

5-foot radius and dim light in a 10-foot one. Once activated, the light stays lit for 12 hours.

***Gateway Projection Device.*** This apparatus fits over the forearm and hand of the user. It has the ability to fire matched portals onto flat surfaces within long range. The weapon has two triggers, one fires blue-rimmed portals and the other orange-rimmed ones. The portals are roughly 6 feet tall and oval-shaped, large enough for a medium-sized creature to pass through comfortably. Entering one portal causes a creature, object, or effect to immediately exit the other. If one portal of each color does not exist, the portal is not enterable, appearing merely as a lighting effect. If the user creates a portal while one of the same color is already in existence, the old portal is immediately replaced with the new one. The device can “fire” a portal up to 120 feet, which takes an action. An active portal can be dismissed as a bonus action. Portals cannot be dismissed if a creature or object is currently traversing them. This is an advanced item.

***Handcuffs.*** The prisoner restraints of choice in most sci-fi worlds, these metal restraints (AC 16, 20 hit points) can restrain a Small or Medium creature. You can restrain an unwilling creature which requires an action, and for the creature to be either restrained, or both grappled and prone. Escaping the manacles requires a DC 22 Dexterity check, and breaking them requires a DC 22 Strength check. Each set of handcuffs comes with one key.

Without the key, a DC 15 thieves’ tools check can pick this lock.

***Long-Range Microphone.*** The audio equivalent of binoculars, long-range microphones allow normal conversation to be heard at a range of up to 300 feet.

***Night-Vision/Multi-Spectrum Goggles.*** These battery-powered goggles grant the user darkvision with a range of 300 feet.

The multi-spectrum version (costing 1000 credits or more) also allows the wearer to see through clouds of smoke, mist, or other non-solid obstructions and pick out heat signatures from the surrounding environment, granting an expertise die to spot hidden creatures with exothermic metabolisms or other objects notably warmer or colder than the surrounding environment, regardless of other visual concealments.

***Night-Vision/Multi-Spectrum Contacts.*** These special contact lenses work the same as the goggles above. This is an advanced item.

***Portable X-Ray Scanner*.** A handheld scanning device used in security searches, a portable x-ray scanner can penetrate even into a subject’s body, revealing surgical hardware, dental fillings, and most importantly, cybernetic implants. It is virtually impossible to hide carried, implanted, or swallowed contraband from this device, which grants the user a passive DC 30 Investigate check to find such things on a one-minute scan.

***Proximity Alarm.*** This device monitors a 20-foot diameter area for up to 8 hours. It has a passive Perception score of 14

and makes a loud noise if it detects movement within that area.

***Range Earmuffs.*** These over-ear headphones provide the same protection as earplugs without the drawback by amplifying ambient sound and cutting off at a certain decibel level.

***Tracer.*** This button-sized device can be planted on a person or vehicle and sends out a signal allowing its location to be tracked, typically via a program on the user’s ICD. While the tracer is active and within 10 miles, you know the direction of it, and combining a tracer with a mapping program (an upgrade that costs an additional 100 cr) can show you the precise location of it on a map. The tracer stays active for 24 hours, but they are easy to find with bug detectors (automatic success, no roll required). They are typically used on targets that will not suspect their presence.

***Zip Cuffs.*** These super lightweight and portable version of handcuffs are used by riot police and in other situations where mass arrests are likely. They have an AC of only 13 and 15 hp, and the Strength check to break them is DC 16. Unlike most restraints, they are single-use, with the cuffs being cut to release a prisoner rather than unlocked with a key.

###### Scientific Gear

Heroes are not always made so because of their ability to fight; scientists have long been revered by sapient societies who admire those who push the frontiers of knowledge past their current boundaries.

Like any task, doing so is easier with the right tool.

***Chemical Detector.*** This handheld device measures various fume levels in the air and provides information about their concentration levels. It is often used by security personnel to look for drugs or explosives. While using a chemical detector, you gain an expertise die on Investigate checks to find hidden drugs, chemicals, or explosives.

***Cryospray.*** An aerosol flash-freezing agent, cryospray is normally used to preserve specimens collected during scientific expeditions, but enterprising users have learned a blast of the spray can make metal brittle (a use of the spray reduces an unattended metal object’s AC by 2) or as an improvised weapon (the spray can only be used on targets within 5 feet, and does 2d6 cold damage). A single canister contains enough for 10 uses.

***Geiger Counter.*** This device measures ambient radiation, emitting an audible warning in the presence of dangerous radiation levels.

###### Survival Gear

The universe is a big place, and those who wish to see unexplored parts of it would do well to pack accordingly. As technology advances, so too do the means to traverse and survive in hostile environments.

***Blanket.*** A basic foil blanket that provides warmth in cold environments.

***Digital Scale.*** An improvement on the merchant’s scale, this version is precise to

.01 oz.

***Distress Beacon.*** A personal-sized version of a standard piece of starship hardware, this device transmits a distress signal and a message of no more than 10 seconds using a powerful transmitter.

Typical range is about 20 miles, though atmospheric conditions may adjust this. They are popular with exploration teams.

***Entrenching Tool.*** A lighter version of the shovel, capable of folding for easy transportation.

***Flashlight.*** The default source of portable light from the discovery of electricity onward. Provides bright light in a 20-foot cone and dim light in a 30-foot one. Alternate versions based on head bands or gloves provide light in more specific areas or hands-free, but only to half the range.

***Floodlight.*** A scaled-up version of a flashlight, a floodlight can light up a much larger area. They are typically either mounted on vehicles or on a tripod. They provide bright light in a 300-foot cone and dim light in a 600-foot cone.

***Gas Mask.*** A full-face mask that protects the wearer from airborne poisons and other dangerous particles. While wearing a gas mask, you automatically succeed on saving throws against inhaled hazards, but the mask narrows your field of view, imposing a -1d4 penalty on

sight-based Perception checks while wearing it.

***Grapple Gun.*** This device is roughly the same size as a heavy pistol. It fires a sturdy line (AC 15, 30 hp, capable of supporting 1000 lbs) which is attached to a grappling hook up to 60/120 feet. The

grapple needs some sort of protrusion to latch onto; common ones are architectural features like railings, ornamental statuary, pipes, and so on. The line can then be retracted, reeling the user toward the hook, granting an effective climb speed of 60 feet. Improved versions (which cost double the cost) have a

nanomachine-paste anchor instead which can bond to any surface able to support the weight on the line. This version does not need to “catch” on anything and can adhere to even sheer surfaces and is considered an advanced item.

***Lighter.*** This small fire-starting device can be used to light anything with abundant, exposed fuel or

highly-flammable objects such as paper as an action. You may also expend a use to cause the lighter to shed dim light in a 5-foot radius for one round.

***Map.*** When using a map, you may travel at a fast pace without taking a penalty to your passive Perception while within the area it depicts. Additionally, you gain an expertise die on checks made to avoid becoming lost.

*Local:* This map depicts a well known area. In most settings digital maps of any explored area are available, often for free.

*Planetary:* This map depicts the entirety of a single planet. On

well-explored or long-inhabited planets this usually includes populated areas, delineations between countries, provinces, and states, and names of natural formations, such as mountain ranges or forests, if they’ve been given them. Many also include topography, elevation, terrain, and even live weather. Planets that have only been seen remotely or have not been properly surveyed may only show major geographical features, known settlements, and established routes (if any).

*System:* This map shows the entirety of a single star system, including planets, meteor belts, moons, and significant planetoids.

*Galactic:* This map is a serious of navigation charts to allow ships to make their way from one galaxy to the next.

Depending on the amount of data the map maker had, it may be more or less detailed or accurate.

***Matches.*** An improvement on the tinderbox. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

***Mirror (plastic).*** Made of synthetic products, this mirror is lighter and cheaper than its steel counterpart.

***Paper.*** With the advancement of technology, paper is significantly cheaper.

***Rope, Synthetic.*** This synthetic rope is lighter than previous versions while still being able to hold the same weight.

***Sleeping Bag.*** An improvement on the bedroll, this light sleeping bag is essential to sleeping outdoors.

***Tent.*** Made of light, synthetic materials, tents provide protection from the elements so long as there is a flat surface to set them up on.

*One Person:* Suitable for a

Medium-sized creature. Occupies a 5-foot by 10-foot space when set up.

*Two Person:* Suitable for up to 2 Medium- sized creatures. Occupies a 10-foot by

10-foot space when set up.

*Communal:* Suitable for up to 6 Medium-sized creatures. Occupies a 15-foot by 15-foot space when set up.

***Umbrella.*** Designed to keep the rain off of pedestrians, these small folding shelters are also sometimes used by protestors to block thrown weapons.

When equipped with an open umbrella, you may make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to bounce a grenade targeting your space to a space 10 feet away from you in the direction the attack originated from.

Umbrellas fold up when not in use, but are a bulky item when open. Folding or unfolding an umbrella costs an action.

###### Toolkits

In addition to the less-technological tools in the base game, these toolkits allow you to perform specialized tasks such as repairs on the specific type of equipment or vehicle or the collection and interpretation of detailed scientific data. If you lack the proper toolkit, tasks that would use it may be impossible, or at best, all checks will be made with disadvantage. You must be proficient with specialist’s tools to use them.

Computers

While they aren’t represented by a specific tool kit, computers are a vital tool proficiency for voidrunners. Much of society relies on them. This tool proficiency represents the normal use of

computers–computer technician kits and hacking tools are different, more specialized proficiencies. You can use the computers tool proficiency to conduct research or operate a device, but you cannot use it to rewire or repair devices or to hack systems.

***Computer Technician Kit.*** This kit includes specialized opening tools, a multimeter, spare parts, thermal compound, and an assortment of cables and adapters. It is used for setting up and performing basic repairs on computer systems or mechanical creatures from an ICD up to a battle droid.

With 10 minutes work and a DC 10 computer technician kit check, you can repair a construct or synthetic lifeform (such as an android) or device. The creature or device regains 1d4 hit points, plus an additional 1d4 hit points if the check's result is 15 or higher. The Narrator might set a higher DC for specialized repairs or decide that such repairs require more time or additional equipment. Fixing a sentinel droid's malfunctioning gyroscopic systems, for example, might require a DC 20 check.

***Cybernetics Kit.*** Contains a mixture of spare parts, anti-rejection drugs, specialized instruments, and basic first aid supplies. This allows you to perform field maintenance and repairs on a creature’s cybernetic implants. It can also be used once as a first-aid kit, but then 2 credits must be spent to replenish the expended supplies before the kit is useful again.

***Disguise Kit.*** This pouch of props, costuming, and cosmetics lets you change your physical appearance. A creature observing you after you make a disguise kit check must make a Perception check (DC equal to the result of your disguise kit

check) in order to see through your disguise.

***Engineer’s Toolbox.*** This kit contains wrenches, bolt drivers, instruments, and so on to work on the drive, braking, navigation, and suspension systems. With 10 minutes work and a DC 10 tools check, you can repair a machine, vehicle, or starfighter. The machine, vehicle or starfighter regains 1d4 hit points, plus an additional 1d4 hit points if the check's result is 15 or higher. The Narrator might set a higher DC for specialized repairs or decide that such repairs require more time or additional equipment. Fixing a wrecked starfighter engine for example, might require a DC 20 check.

The toolbox also contains a

standard-issue military field maintenance kit for modifying and repairing high-tech weapons and armor. It includes the small drivers, hardening sprays, and cleaning supplies needed to keep a soldier’s combat gear working.

***Field Laboratory.*** A semi-portable lab with various scientific instruments, sample containers, and reagents allows a creature proficient with the Science skill to perform various types of testing such as identifying substances or organisms, measuring environmental effects such as barometric pressure and seismic activity, and other similar tasks. Some tasks may only be possible with a Field Laboratory, but ones that do not require it (Narrator’s discretion) are made with advantage instead.

***Hacking Tools.*** Hacking tools resemble common datapads containing potent hacking programs, but they can also be more custom-rigged device amalgams that better reflect their less-than-legal purpose. If you are proficient with hacking tools, you can use an action to begin a hack by making a hacking tools check against a DC determined by the security of the device being hacked. If successful you begin hacking that device, while hacking a device your hacking tools cannot be used to hack another device until the previous hack attempt ends.

***Medical Pouch.*** Often referred to as ‘crash kit’, the professional version of a first-aid kit, crash kits are most useful to those with formal medical training. Any creature can expend one use to stabilize a dying creature without the need for a Medicine check, even if they are not proficient.

However, creatures with proficiency in Medicine can spend a use of the kit to greater effect. When a creature proficient in Medicine makes a Medicine check with the kit to stabilize a creature, the creature recovers 1d6 hit points for every 5 points the DC of the check is exceeded by (1d6 on a result of 15, 2d6 on a result of 20, etc.) The kit can be used 5 times before being depleted. Replacement supplies cost 25 credits per use.

A medical pouch can also be used to remove a condition from an adjacent creature, as long as the condition is a temporary condition and originally required a saving throw to avoid or resist and is on the following list: blinded, charmed, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, slowed, stunned. Use an action to make a Medicine check with a DC equal to the saving throw DC originally required to resist or avoid the condition. On a success, the condition is removed. At the Narrator’s discretion, certain conditions may not be removable in this manner, and a creature can only benefit from this feature once per long rest.

***Multi-Scanner.*** This handheld device can analyze the chemical makeup of a substance, diagnose illnesses or injuries, determine the levels of any known type of radiation, measure temperature, wind direction, and barometric pressure, carbon-date a sample of organic material, scan the genetics of a creature, detect life forms, and so on. Any sort of reading that could be supplied by a specific scientific or medical instrument can be quickly and accurately supplied by the multi-scanner. Getting a scan of a target within 10 feet requires one action, and uses either the Science or Medicine skill depending on the nature of the scan. Using a

multi-scanner gives you advantage on Science and Medicine checks, and an expertise die on Engineering or Investigation checks where precise scientific data would be useful. This is an advanced item.

***Thieves' Tools.*** This set of technical instruments are used to open mechanical locks. You can use an action to open a lock by making a thieves’ tools check against a DC determined by the quality of the lock being picked.

Musical Instruments

The musical arts grow and innovate as artists gain access to new technologies and new potential sounds. Musical instruments are a type of tool, and the following instruments have been added to the list of instruments found in the base game.

**Table: Musical Instruments**

|  |  |  |

| Harmonica | 2 cr | — |
| Keytar | 50 cr | 12 lbs. |
| Saxophone | 40 cr | 4 lbs. |
| Theremin | 20 cr | 2 lbs. |

#### Cyberware

One of the most dramatic examples of technological progress is the introduction of cyberware, which allows living creatures to replace parts of themselves with artificial components or implant devices which grant them new abilities into their bodies.

Prosthetics

The most common and simplest form of cyberware are prosthetics. It is the default assumption that any world with FTL travel will have also developed sophisticated prosthetics, though the specifics of those can vary. A character that has suffered the loss of a limb, organ, or other body part can receive a fully-functional replacement for 1,000 credits, though in some settings this type of medical care may be fully or partially-covered by a character’s government benefits or insurance plan. In other settings, this service may be significantly more expensive, costing 5, 10, or even 100 times as much, making these prosthetics the realm of the wealthy or

well-connected and consigning the poor to non-technological options.

Prosthetics function just like the body part they emulate (though they may look different). The prosthetic may be plastic, or metal; vat-grown clones from creature’s own stem cells are fully indistinguishable from the original.

Enhancement Implants

Implants provide new or enhanced capabilities to a creature. The cost listed for enhancement implants includes the cost of having them surgically implanted. As long as the implant procedure is done with the proper equipment, there is no chance of

rejection or failure; however, creatures need time to adjust to the presence of the implants. Therefore, a character may only have a number of enhancement implants equal to their proficiency bonus. If more are added, the newest implants simply do nothing until the implanted character’s proficiency bonus rises enough to accommodate them, with the oldest inactive implant always coming online first.

Despite the advantages they provide, enhancement implants have drawbacks as well— they require some level of external networking to function, which makes them vulnerable to various attacks such as hacking and EMPs. The DC to hack an implant is 8 + the creature’s Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus.

Adhesion Pads

**Cost:** 500 credits

You have nanomachine adhesion pads implanted on your palms and the soles of your feet. While you are barefoot and not wearing gloves, you gain the ability to walk on walls and upside down on ceilings, as well as a climbing speed equal to your base Speed. The implant can also be activated as a reaction in response to a Disarm attempt, allowing you to automatically succeed the maneuver check to retain your weapon.

**Hacking.** If hacked, the implants will go into a safety lock mode and will not release until the emergency reboot procedure (which takes 1d4 rounds) completes. During this time you are stuck to whatever surface you are in contact with and your Speed is reduced to 0.

Augmented Reality System

**Cost:** 5,000 credits

This system projects useful information onto your field of view. When making a skill check you have proficiency in, you gain an expertise die as though you had the relevant skill speciality. If this implant is used in concert with an implanted or ranged

weapon connected to you with a cyberlink, that weapon’s short range increases by a number of feet equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus, up to a maximum of its long range. Its long range is unaffected.

**Hacking.** If this system is hacked, it projects static into your field of view. You suffer disadvantage on all checks based on sight (such as Perception, Investigation, and Insight) and ranged attacks (but not melee ones) until the hack ends or you reboot the system, which takes 1 minute. You are blinded while the system reboots, but can choose when to initiate the reboot.

Biomonitor

**Cost:** 300 credits

While it is functioning, a biomonitor provides detailed medical data and helps regulate your body’s systems. Creatures making Medicine checks on you while accessing the biomonitor do so with advantage, and you regain an extra hit point for every hit die you spend during a short rest.

**Hacking*.*** If the monitor is disabled via hacking or the character is subject to an EMP blast, the monitor goes into a failsafe mode. During this time, you suffer the effects of two levels of fatigue that cannot be removed until the implant is reset. Resetting the biomonitor requires a short rest and a cybernetics kit. Additionally, when a hacker who gains access to the biomonitor’s output data makes a successful attack roll against you they deal extra damage equal to their proficiency bonus. Resetting the implant removes this damage bonus.

Comms Implant

**Cost:** 150 credits

You have an implanted ICD (see Communications and Computing) which is by default connected only to your auditory cortex and vocal chords, allowing you to receive voice comms privately and inaudibly. If you also

have an augmented reality system, you gain full ICD functionality including video and text messaging, app usage, and so on as if you were connected via a cyberlink.

**Hacking*.*** If hacked, the implant shuts down and stops working until it is rebooted, which requires 1 minute. During this time, it may not be used for any sort of communication or application functionality, but you are otherwise unaffected.

Companion AI

**Cost:** 2,000 cr

You have a non-sentient AI integrated with your brain. You recall everything you have experienced in the past week in perfect detail and can opt to manually store specific memories on more permanent storage (costing 50 credits per hour of memory) if desired. You also make all Intelligence checks and saving throws with advantage and Intelligence-based checks take you half as long.

**Hacking*.*** If the AI is hacked, you immediately suffer 2d8 psychic damage and gain two levels of strife that persist until the implant is reset, which requires a short rest and a cybernetics kit.

Cyberlink

**Cost:** 1,000 credits

A cyberlink allows you to bypass all conventional forms of input in terms of direct mental interface with any connected device. Cyberlink cables are typically only about a foot long, requiring you to hold the item you are interfacing with or touch it. If the item is a weapon, you count as proficient with it, even if you normally would not be. At the Narrator’s discretion, you may gain additional benefits if you also have an augmented reality system.

**Hacking*.*** If the implant is hacked, you suffer 2d8 lightning damage and are slowed for 1d6 rounds.

Implanted Psionic Focus

**Cost:** 500 credits

You gain the benefits of a psionic focus without needing an external piece of gear.

**Hacking*.*** If hacked, the focus goes haywire. For the next minute, using any psionic power deals 1d6 psychic damage to you. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, you are rattled for the duration, and any saving throws you make against the psionic abilities of other creatures are made with disadvantage. The implant stabilizes automatically.

Implanted Weapon

**Cost:** weapon cost + 30%

A weapon is implanted into your body, typically in a forearm or hand. The primary benefits of this implant are stealth and constant access; the weapon functions the same as a handheld version in combat. Melee weapons chosen for this implant must have the light property and ranged weapons are limited to pistols.

**Hacking.** The weapon can be hacked, temporarily disabling it. Getting it working again requires a cybernetics kit and a DC 15 Computers check as part of a long rest.

Jump Coils

**Cost:** 600 credits

You do not need to move to make a long jump, and your jumping distances are tripled. You also can safely fall up to 100 feet without taking damage as long as you are not incapacitated.

**Hacking.** If hacked, the system locks, dramatically hampering your movement. Your walking speed decreases by 20 feet and for every 10 minutes of walking, you suffer a level of fatigue. Repairing the system requires a DC 15 check with a cybernetics kit and a short rest.

Vision Enhancers

**Cost:** 500 cr

A set of high-performance sensors are implanted in your eyes or the surrounding area and connected to your visual cortex. While active, they function as a set of multi-spectrum goggles.

**Hacking.** If you are subjected to an EMP blast, the implant malfunctions. The character loses the benefits of the implant and treats everything as lightly obscured until they can reboot the implant, which takes 1d4 rounds.

#### Vehicles

Even in a spacefaring age there will always be a need for planetside vehicles. The following vehicles are distinct from spacecraft and follow the basic rules for vehicles as presented in the base game, with new additions as we advance from sailing ships and wagons to helicopters and hover cars.

##### Size

Technological advancement brings a host of new vehicular possibilities. Small vehicles like scooters, and truly massive vehicles like shuttle crawlers and mining machines exist alongside cars, trucks, boats, and planes.

***Small.*** A Small vehicle has Strength and Constitution scores of 10 (+0), can 1 passenger along with the driver, up to 10 Supply, and up to 2 bulky items in addition to 300 lbs of carrying capacity.

***Medium.*** A Medium vehicle has Strength and Constitution scores of 12 (+1), can carry up to 2 passengers along with the driver, up to 15 Supply, and up to 5 bulky items in addition to 500 lbs of carrying capacity.

***Large.*** A Large vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 14 (+2), can carry up to 3 passengers along with the driver, up to 40 Supply, and up to 10 bulky

items in addition to 2,000 lbs. of carrying capacity.

***Huge*.** A Huge vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 18 (+4), can carry up to 6 passengers along with the driver, up to 80 Supply, and up to 20 bulky items in addition to 4,000 lbs. of carrying capacity.

***Gargantuan.*** A Gargantuan vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 22 (+6), can carry a number of additional passengers equal to the minimum required crew, up to 800 Supply, and up to 200 bulky items in addition to 40,000 lbs. of carrying capacity.

***Titanic.*** A Titanic vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 26 (+8,) can carry a number of additional passengers equal to the quadruple the minimum required crew, up to 4,000 supply, and up to 1,000 bulky items in addition to 200,000 lbs of carrying capacity.

##### Collisions

If a vehicle enters the space occupied by a creature or another object, a collision occurs. Both the vehicle and whatever it impacts take bludgeoning damage according to the other’s size:

**Table: Vehicle Collisions Size Damage**

Small 1d6

Medium 2d6

Large 4d6

Huge 8d6

Gargantuan 12d6 Titanic 16d6

If the object or creature impacted is the same size as the vehicle or larger, the vehicle immediately stops and loses momentum. If the object or creature impacted is smaller than the vehicle, it is shunted into the closest unoccupied space that allows the vehicle to complete its movement unimpeded.

##### Malfunctions

When a vehicle is reduced to half its total hit points or less, it is damaged and suffers a malfunction. Roll 1d6 on Table: Malfunctions to determine the nature of the malfunction. Vehicle malfunctions can usually be fully repaired during a short rest by a proficient user with an engineering toolkit.

**Table: Malfunctions D6 MALFUNCTION**

* 1. ***Movement.*** Movement has been compromised, such as losing the sails, losing the animal team drawing the vehicle, or destroying an engine. The vehicle’s Speed is reduced to half its normal value.
  2. ***Integrity.*** Some key component holding everything together has been lost and the vehicle immediately loses additional hit points equal to 25% of its hit point maximum.
  3. ***Brakes.*** The ability to stop has been lost. The vehicle moves at its Speed each round until it collides with an obstacle of its size or larger.
  4. ***Steering.*** The driver’s ability to fully control the vehicle has been compromised. The vehicle cannot turn.
  5. ***Cargo.*** Half of any Supply currently carried by the vehicle are destroyed.
  6. ***Superficial.*** The damage looks bad but doesn’t cause any further issues.

##### Hotwiring a Vehicle

Unlike the humble wagon, technological vehicles can be hotwired, allowing a voidrunner to go for a ride—for a time, at least. In a futuristic setting, this calls for a hacking check, as these vehicles are operated by computers. Civilian vehicles typically have a hacking DC of 12, while military vehicles have a hacking DC of 18. See Contested Hacks for more information.

###### Vehicle Properties

Vehicles in a science fiction setting have the ability to go many more places and do many more things than those in a typical medieval setting do, including incorporating massive tools, mobile working environments, and protections from hostile environments.

***All-Terrain.*** All-terrain vehicles have heavy-duty suspensions and tracks or special tires. They ignore difficult terrain.

***Amphibious.*** Vehicles with this feature count as both land and water vehicles.

***Armed.*** Armed vehicles have one or more weapons in place on board. A creature can use an action to fire a weapon or reload it.

***Armored.*** The vehicle is covered in some sort of armor plating. Like personal armor, multiple levels of vehicle armor exist. Each level of armor reduces the damage dealt by an attack by a number listed in the Damage Reduction column of Table: Armored Vehicles and grants the cover listed to its occupants.

**Table: Armored Vehicles**

***Drop.*** This vehicle descends from the upper atmosphere at terminal velocity. Landing thrusters engage at about 500 feet above the ground. The given Speed applies to the vehicle once the landing thrusters have fired.

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ARMO R GRADE** | **COVER** | **DAMAGE REDUCTIO N** | **SPECIAL** |
| Light | Half cover | 2 | — |
| Medium | Three-quarte rs cover | 4 | — |
| Heavy | Full cover | 6 | Immune to the breaker weapon property. |
| Ultra-he avy | Full cover | 8 | Immune to the breaker weapon property. |

***Heavy Equipment.*** The vehicle contains a digger, wrecking ball, roller, massive saw, or other heavy tool. Attacks made with this tool suffer disadvantage and deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage as appropriate. The tool deals damage according to the vehicle’s size: Large—4d6 damage, Huge—8d6 damage, Gargantuan—12d6 damage, or Titanic—16d6 damage.

***Hover.*** A high-tech development, this vehicle hovers above the surface of solid ground or liquids. It is a land vehicle, but can traverse any surface features by hovering up to 10 feet above the ground without being slowed by difficult terrain or sinking into liquid.

***Integrated Equipment.*** The vehicle includes one or more pieces of integrated equipment. This equipment can be activated or deactivated as a bonus action.

* *Plow:* The plow provides an additional +1 to AC against attacks from the front and pushes loose, solid obstacles such as unpacked dirt or snow out of the vehicle’s way as it travels. A vehicle can only travel at half its Speed with a plow deployed.
* *Crane:* The vehicle includes a crane arm for reaching high locations. The vehicle must be stopped to use the crane arm. A crane arm may have a tool attached, but typically has either a passenger basket or a winch. A Large vehicle can reach up to 40 feet with a crane boom and a Huge one can reach up to 150 feet. The winch on a Huge crane can lift up to 80 tons, but the vehicle must be stopped and anchored (a process which takes 10 minutes) before it can start moving cargo.
* *Fire Suppression System:* This vehicle has high-pressure hoses that can spray water or fire suppressing foam up to 120 feet. This equipment can also be used as a water cannon.
* *Floodlight:* The vehicle has one or more floodlights.
* *Construction Foam Dispenser:* The vehicle includes a heavy construction foam tank and dispenser system. The tank can carry up to 350 cubic feet of construction foam.
* *Winch:* The vehicle has a sturdy winch and cable. To use a winch, the vehicle must be stopped on a solid surface. A large vehicle can move up to 10 tons, a huge one can move up to 80 tons, and gargantuan winches that can move even heavier weights exist, but

are primarily found at ports rather than out on vehicles.

***Legged.*** The vehicle has mechanical legs. It gains the benefits of the all-terrain feature and can also clamber over obstacles of up to the vehicle’s own size (moving at a maximum of half the vehicle’s Speed when doing so), but the vehicle can be knocked over, suffering from the prone condition. Just like a creature, a prone vehicle must spend half its movement to stand up from prone and cannot move until it does.

***Mass Transit.*** A mass transit vehicle is a specialized version of the transport type, and only needs a crew of up to 4 people to operate, regardless of size, though often additional crew members will provide security, customer service, and similar functions. The remaining capacity can be occupied by passengers.

***Miniature.*** A miniature vehicle is designed to be operated by an operator one size larger than the vehicle itself without penalties.

***Mobile Facilities.*** The vehicle incorporates the features of a starship deck. A vehicle must be at least Huge size to accommodate a single mobile facility or Gargantuan to have up to 4. Available options are leisure deck, medical bay, operations center, and science bay Additionally, mobile facilities can have the following additional options:

* *Workshop:* Provides the benefits of any four typ*e*s *o*f vehicle repair tools as well as weapons and armor maintenance tools.
* *Kitchen:* The vehicle has compact but versatile food storage and preparation equipment such as freezer, ovens, providing cook’s tools that can be simultaneously used at advantage by a number of creatures equal to half its crew size.
* *Residence:* The vehicle provides sleeping quarters, shower and toilet systems, and a set of cook’s tools.
* *Store:* The vehicle has a cramped, but browsable, selection of retail shelving.
* *Holding Cell:* The vehicle has a passenger compartment that can be secured from the outside for prisoner transport. DC 20 Strength check to escape.

***Open-Frame.*** Open-frame vehicles do not have enclosing body panels. They provide excellent visibility (and fields of fire) for their occupants, but provide no cover against incoming shots. Regardless of how armored a vehicle with open-frame is, the armor only protects the vehicle itself, not the occupants.

***Personal.*** Personal vehicles are designed for a single occupant and usually have far less space. Vehicles with this property can only ever carry a maximum of one person, and have

one-quarter the carrying capacity of a normal vehicle of the same size.

***Pressurized.*** A pressurized vehicle must also be sealed. It has internal pressure systems that maintain a livable pressure for the occupants, allowing them to survive in hard vacuum, at high altitudes, or deep underwater without the need for additional protective gear.

***Railway.*** A railway vehicle travels along a permanent route of some sort, such as train tracks, a maglev system, or the tether of a space elevator.

***Ridden.*** A ridden vehicle relies on the muscle power of its rider to propel it, and its speed is determined by the speed of the creature riding it. Multiply the speed of the creature by the indicated value to get the speed of the vehicle, rounding the result down to the nearest 10 feet. For example, a ridden (×3) vehicle ridden by a creature with a speed of 35 feet has a speed of 100 feet or 10 miles per hour.

Furthermore, because ridden vehicles rely on the muscles of their riders to move, their carrying capacity is limited to double that of their rider unless otherwise stated.

**Sensor Array.** The vehicle provides the crew with the benefits of a set of

multi-spectrum goggles while crewing the vehicle. An occupant can use a bonus action to do an active scan, giving them an expertise die on Perception checks.

***Sensor Array, Long Range.*** The vehicle has a sensor package including technologies such as radar, sonar, or satellite imaging data that allows a creature to make Perception checks to locate vehicles or structures of at least Large size within a range of 10 miles. Each such attempt requires an action. ***Sealed.*** A sealed vehicle is airtight, keeping the interior atmosphere in and whatever is outside out. This is more for comfort than protection, however, keeping out sand or high and low temperatures.

Extreme environments, such as those in a vacuum, high-altitude, and underwater, require the additional protection of the pressurized feature.

***Sprayer.*** The vehicle has either a spraying nozzle to distribute liquids across an area behind it or a rotating spreader that performs the same function for solid particulate substances, such as sand, salt, or even seeds. In either case, the effect is the same: a path behind the sprayer the same width as the vehicle and a length equal to the distance the vehicle traveled that round is covered in whatever is loaded into the sprayer. Some common loads are listed below. Unless otherwise noted these loads refer to land vehicles.

Typically a liquid sprayer can be used for 20 turns. Solid sprayers are normally incorporated into large, heavy vehicles that can cover miles and miles before needing to be refilled.

**Adhesive:** A gluey substance coats the area. Vehicles that enter this area make a DC 17 Constitution save, involuntarily taking the Braking action until stopped on a failed save. It cannot move again until repairs are made.

Creatures also make the Constitution save, becoming restrained on a failure.

**Caltrops:** Vehicles and creatures that enter this area or begin their turn in it make a DC 15 Dexterity save, taking 1d6 piercing damage for every 10 feet of distance they move. The driver of a vehicle with tires makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw and safely stops the vehicle on a success. On a failure

the vehicle either takes the Brake action and stops or rolls over and crashes at the Narrator’s discretion.

**Grit:** Vehicles and creatures in the affected area ignore difficult terrain caused by ice and/or snow.

**Lubricant:** A slippery trail is left behind. Vehicles and creatures that enter this area for the first time on a turn or begin their turn in the area make a DC 15 Dexterity save. On a failed save, the vehicle spins, moving half its movement speed in a randomly determined direction. Creatures that fail the save become prone.

***Stealth.*** The vehicle has advanced detection countermeasures. Attempts to locate it with sensors or target it with guided weapons are at disadvantage.

***Submersible.*** Submersible vehicles are able to travel safely below the surface of the water. They function as having the three-dimensional property with respect to traveling in water and can move up or down below the surface of the water as well as traveling along the surface of it.

Submersible vehicles must also have the pressurized feature.

***Three-Dimensional.*** A

three-dimensional vehicle may also turn up or down when making turns. Flying vehicles nearly always have the

three-dimensional property. Land or water vehicles need the tunneling or submersible property, respectively, to have this property and, if they are on the surface, can only turn down unless they also have a fly speed.

***Transforming.*** The vehicle has two separate forms. This is often a legged form and a more typical vehicular form, but many variations exist. Both forms must be of the same size category.

***Transport.*** Transport vehicles are designed for cargo and crew, and have twice the carrying capacity and maximum number of passengers as normal for a vehicle of the same size.

***Tunneling.*** The vehicle is equipped with a heavy drill, grinder, or other tunneling apparatus at the front, granting it a burrow

speed equal to its movement speed as well as the three-dimensional feature (down only). Vehicles always leave a tunnel equal to their size when burrowing.

***VTOL.*** A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle must have a fly speed. It can hover in place. This is typically either due to rotary wings (like a helicopter) or an anti-grav system.

***Windowless.*** The vehicle grants full cover to its occupants regardless of its armor level. However, occupants must rely on sensors or cameras to perceive their surroundings.

##### Vehicle Weapons

Vehicles are equipped with a wide variety of powerful weaponry. Most fall into one of the following broad categories: direct fire, indirect fire, guided fire, or area fire.

Vehicular weapons can have the same breaker, burst fire, loading, long range, or reloading properties as personal weapons. Vehicle weapons can also be fitted with weapon augments (see Customized Weapons). All vehicle weapons are considered to be mounted.

Vehicle weapons of up to Large size can be purchased as a mounted weapon or added to existing vehicles. Weapons with a size of Huge or larger or with a price of “integrated” are large, complex, or otherwise demanding in some way and can only be installed on a vehicle specifically designed to use it. Additionally, the Aquatic weapon trait applies to some vehicle weapons.

###### Special Ammunition

Indirect fire and guided weapons typically have a wider variety of ammunition types than direct fire weapons do. Basic weapon descriptions assume a general purpose warhead, but additional types exist. When using special ammunition, the number of dice remains the same as the base ammunition type, but the size of dice and type of damage can change and additional effects may be present. Ammunition with a “special” damage type does no damage on impact/detonation and instead produces some other effect.

***Armor-Piercing.*** This ammunition deals piercing damage and ignores up to 5 points of damage reduction.

***Anti-Personnel.*** This ammunition deals slashing damage, and its damage die is increased one step from its normal damage. The radius of this effect is determined by the weapon’s size: Medium—15 feet, Large—30 feet, Huge—45 feet, and Gargantuan—60 feet.

Creatures in this area can make a DC 15 Dexterity save, taking half damage on a success.

***High Explosive.*** This ammunition deals thunder damage to its target, as well as half damage to all targets within a certain radius. This distance is determined by the weapon’s size: Medium—10 feet, Large—20 feet, Huge—30 feet, and Gargantuan—40 feet.

***Incendiary.*** This ammunition deals fire damage to its target, as well as half damage to all targets within a certain radius.
