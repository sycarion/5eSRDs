# Exploration

# The Journey 

At the heart of exploration is the journey, or the story that happens
while the adventurers travel from origin to destination – surviving
the elements, discovering new places, and overcoming the obstacles
presented by the environment.

Before a journey, the party sets their travel pace, or how fast they'd
like to go. The Narrator determines the difficulty of the journey itself
and the number of encounters the adventurers have on the journey. Some
encounters might be a fight against one or more monsters or happening
across other travelers, but they'll also have to contend with the world
itself in exploration challenges.

## Navigation 

When the adventurers have a map (see Survival Gear) there is little
chance of them getting lost. The mystery lies in the time it takes them
to reach their destination, and the challenges that they face along the
way. Without a map, adventurers always know which region (see below)
they are in, but are not usually aware of adjacent regions (unless one
of them takes the Scout journey activity). They can journey from region
to region, making choices along the way – for example, the party might
be in Rolling Grasslands, and need to decide between hiking Lofty
Mountains or chancing a Feywood as their next step before finally
reaching some safe Open Roads leading to their destination.

## Travel Pace 

Adventurers can travel at a normal, fast, or slow pace, which
determines the distance they cover in a day of travel (see Table: Travel
Pace). While a fast pace might shorten the time required for a journey,
moving so quickly makes travelers less aware of the dangers around them.
Likewise, a steadier slow pace prolongs a journey but adventurers can
stay alert, cover their tracks, and move more stealthily. The effects
from traveling faster than a slow pace are cumulative.

Fatigue. Creatures suffering from two or more levels of fatigue
cannot travel faster than at a normal pace. Creatures suffering from
three or more levels of fatigue cannot travel faster than at a slow
pace. Creatures suffering from four or more levels of fatigue cannot
travel faster than a crawl.

### Travel Pace Table

- **Crawl**  
  - **MI/MINUTE:** 50 feet  
  - **MI/HOUR:** 1/2 mile  
  - **MI/DAY:** 4 miles  
  - **Effect:** Advantage on Survival checks to cover tracks  

- **Slow/Walking**  
  - **MI/MINUTE:** 200 feet  
  - **MI/HOUR:** 2 miles  
  - **MI/DAY:** 16 miles  
  - **Effect:** None  

- **Normal Walking**  
  - **MI/MINUTE:** 300 feet  
  - **MI/HOUR:** 3 miles  
  - **MI/DAY:** 24 miles  
  - **Effect:** Unable to use Stealth  

- **Fast/Mounted**  
  - **MI/MINUTE:** 400 feet  
  - **MI/HOUR:** 4 miles  
  - **MI/DAY:** 32 miles  
  - **Effect:** -5 penalty to Passive Perception and disadvantage on Perception checks  

- **Gallop**  
  - **MI/MINUTE:** 800 feet  
  - **MI/HOUR:** 8 miles\*  
  - **MI/DAY:** –  
  - **Effect:** Disadvantage on Survival checks to track  

A mount can only travel at gallop speed for 1 hour each day. Otherwise, it travels at the fast/mounted pace.

### Forced March 

Adventurers on a journey can travel for up to 8 hours in a day before
requiring a long rest to reinvigorate themselves and continue – any
further and they may exhaust themselves. For every additional hour of
travel past 8 hours, an adventurer makes a Constitution saving throw at
the end of the hour (DC 10 + the number of additional hours of travel),
suffering a level of fatigue on a failure. The party can set the pace,
increasing the DC of the saving throw for a normal pace (+1) or
fast/mounted pace (+2).

### Mounts and Pack Animals 

Mounts such as riding horses can only travel for about an hour a day at
the gallop pace listed in Table: Travel Pace. While mounts and pack
animals may be useful on a journey, they are also a responsibility each mount requires its own Supply, may have difficulty traveling in
different kinds of environments, and can become a liability during
certain exploration challenges. For example, it may be difficult to lead
a mount through a swampy area or have it traverse a landslide.

### Resting and Havens 

While on a journey, adventurers are only able to recover from 2 or more
levels of fatigue or strife on a long rest when they have access to a
haven. A haven is a place to get a meal and a full night's sleep without
the reasonable risk of attack or harm from the elements. For example, an
inn is considered a haven, but a campsite where adventurers must take
turns keeping watch through the night is not. Some spells and class
features may create havens.

### Tracking Supply 

Mundane consumable items like food and water are simplified into a
single item called Supply. When an adventurer gains access to food and
water, they can add Supply to their inventory. Basic rations (dry food
and water) usually costs 5 silver for 1 Supply, but finer foods may cost
more.

-   1 Supply consists of enough combined food and water to sustain a
    Small- or Medium- sized creature for a day.
-   Large-sized creatures require 2 Supply each day. Creatures of Huge
    size or larger require an amount of Supply determined by the
    Narrator.
-   A creature can carry a number of Supply equal to its Strength score
    in addition to the rest of its gear. A Large-sized creature can
    carry Supply equal to twice its Strength score.
-   Whenever a creature takes a long rest, it must consume Supply. If
    it does not, it gains a level of fatigue.
-   At the Narrator's discretion a beast can hunt, forage, or graze
    before taking a long rest, only requiring Supply if the region is
    not plentiful enough for it to do so.
-   Supply consumed while in another form (like while under the effects
    of a polymorphing spell or a druid's wild shape) is wasted and
    provides no nourishment when a creature returns to its normal
    form.

When adventurers run out of Supply while journeying, they can access
more in a few ways. Some journey activities allow adventurers to forage
for more food and water. Boons and discoveries, which are common rewards
for exploration challenges, may lead to more Supply. As a last resort,
the party may need to take a detour to the nearest town, find a
wandering merchant, or even abandon the journey and head home.

### Vehicles 

Not all travel is done by foot or hoof. Vehicles are used by many
adventurers to help travel the vast distances of the world.

Land Vehicles. Wagons and carts are unable to go faster than a
slow pace, but some land vehicles can choose at which pace to move.
Stealth cannot be used while journeying in a land vehicle, and they
require a DC 13 land vehicle check every day spent traveling at a fast
pace. On a failure, the vehicle suffers a malfunction.

Water Vehicles. Water vehicles are restricted by the speed of
the vehicle and gain no benefits from a slow pace, but have no penalties
for moving at a fast pace. Depending on the vehicle and crew size, a
ship can travel up to 24 hours a day.

## Regions 

A region is an area of the world, defined geographically by its
physical features. It might be a vast forest or a sandy desert; or it
might be a snow-tipped mountain range or a stretch of underground
caverns. Regions are often – but not always – named areas on the
map. Regions are important building blocks of the world, and each region
has its own properties and encounter tables. Later in this chapter are
some common regions for Narrators to use.

Combined Regions. Sometimes an area on the map might fit the
description of more than one region. The Narrator may choose either
region, combine both, or create a new region.

Terrains. A region can have more than one kind of terrain and
those listed are general suggestions for the most common types to be
found there. Ultimately the types of terrain in a region are at the
Narrator's discretion and the needs of the campaign.

Regions and Tiers. Each region on the map is
designated with a tier (from 0–4) which corresponds with the
adventuring tiers of play. Any region can be any tier.

A region's tier determines the difficulty of the challenges encountered
within. Exploration and monster encounter tables are all categorized by
tier, making it easy to select tier-relevant encounters. Of course,
exceptions can and do exist, and a powerful monster can wander into a
low-tier region, but such an occurrence is not typical of that region
and is usually used as the subject of an adventure rather than a random
encounter.

It should be noted that it is possible for a low-level party to wander
into a region too dangerous for them. The Narrator should provide clues
to the danger level and – where appropriate – allow for some means
of escape should the adventurers find themselves in over their
heads.

Party-Appropriate Challenges. In some games the Narrator may
prefer not to designate regions with a default tier, and instead present
the adventurers with encounters and challenges appropriate for their
level.

### Weather 

Each region contains a short list of randomly generated weather
options. These are generally limited to non-extreme weather conditions,
including clear, overcast, mist, rain, and snow, and are purely
descriptive tools to help the Narrator set the scene – they do not
affect the adventurers. More extreme weather events are treated as
exploration challenges (see page 106) and include phenomena like
blizzards, dense fogs, hail storms, sandstorms, tornados, thunderstorms,
and more.

Roll a d20 for weather once for each region. In the winter season, add
5 to the roll, unless the region is in a notably warm or tropical clime.
Occasionally, exploration challenges result in extreme weather events.
These include the following.

-   Blinding Blizzard (CR 1)
-   Choking Smoke (CR 11)
-   Dense Fog (CR 6)
-   Flash Flood (CR 6)
-   Flood (CR 3)
-   Hail Deluge (CR 8)
-   Hail Storm (CR 1)
-   Haze (CR 1/4)
-   Hoar Frost (CR 15)
-   Killing Cloud (CR 18)
-   Primordial Tornado (CR 12)
-   Sandstorm (CR 7)
-   Sunspots (CR 11)
-   Thunderstorm (CR 3)
-   Tornado (CR 10)
-   Tsunami (CR 17)

### Encounters 

Each region the adventurers travel through will include one or more
encounters. The Narrator decides how many encounters the party
has.

Encounters include four categories: exploration challenges, monsters,
social encounters, and scenery. It is important that the players do not
know which type of encounter they've stumbled into – it should be
introduced to them narratively. That chill feeling might be mere
scenery, but it might be the sign of some kind of undead spirit, or it
might foreshadow a weather event.

Each region presents encounter tables which include all four encounter
types. The Narrator can roll on these tables, choose an option, or
introduce something new.

Along a journey the Narrator should employ a mix of combat encounters,
social encounters, exploration challenges, and scenery. Exploration
challenges, which are detailed later, have assigned tiers and challenge
ratings that correspond to adventurers' levels. It is assumed that
high-level adventurers are able to pass tier 1 exploration challenges
without much effort, but a tier 4 exploration challenge poses a major
threat.

Ultimately how many encounters adventurers have while traveling is at
the discretion of the Narrator, but in general it's recommended that the
party has at least one encounter (combat, exploration, or social) in
every region they journey through to make it memorable. Some regions are
going to have more encounters than other regions – either because they
are tumultuous, the area plays an important part in the campaign, or
they are large in size – and the types of encounters the party might
have in a given region are listed in its Exploring table. Depending on
the needs of the game and campaign setting, the types of encounters,
frequency of encounters, and difficulty of certain journey activities
might be different.

## Journey Activities 

Adventurers have the option to participate in activities while
traveling in order to pick up some extra resources, improve the
conditions of their journey, or learn more about the world around
them.

Difficulty Class. The DC of a journey activity is
based on the region's tier: 

- tier 0 – DC 10
- tier 1 – DC 12
- tier 2 – DC 14
- tier 3 – DC 16
- tier 4 – DC 18

Depending on the region, some journey activities are made with either advantage or disadvantage.

Experienced Travelers. The Busk and Rob journey activities are
most profitable for novice adventurers, but experienced travelers can
sometimes pick out a mark carrying confidential materials instead of
gold, and nobles seek out performers of note wherever they might be.
Additionally, when an adventurer is attempting to gather a specific
component of 100 gold or less with Gather Components, they can roll with
disadvantage, finding it on a success.

Modifying DC. The Narrator can raise the DC on a journey
activity based on extenuating circumstances. Here are some suggestions
for modifying a journey activity's difficulty class:

-   Inclement Weather (+2) may impede an adventurer's ability
    to search for things with the Scout activity, or lead to fewer
    people on the road (making the Busk and Rob activities more
    difficult).
-   Multitasking (+3) such as attempting a journey activity
    while trying not to be discovered, may make it harder to attempt the
    check.
-   Hostile Territory (+4) may make it difficult to interact
    with the locals, impeding a check made to Busk or Gossip. It may be
    dangerous to stop, so taking the Pray activity or using Scout is
    harder to do.

Adventurers choose how long (in days) to engage in an activity, making
a single check for that duration, and many activities grant additional
rewards based on the time spent doing them. For example, when using the
Busk activity, a PC gains gold for each day they perform that activity.
An adventurer is free to divide their travel across a region into
different activities, performing each for a number of days. When
determining how many days the adventurer is undertaking an activity for,
count the total number of days and roll once, even if those days are not
consecutive. When to make a check for a journey activity is determined
by what region it is made in and otherwise at the Narrator's
discretion.

Adventurers usually choose one journey activity for the entire region,
and many activities grant additional rewards based on the time spent
doing them. For example, when using the Busk activity, a PC gains gold
for each day they perform that activity. The number of days spent is
determined by the size of the region and the party\'s travel
speed.

When making an ability check for a journey activity, the check is made
at the start of the region. An adventurer may achieve a success or a
failure, or a critical success or a critical failure, each with a
different outcome which applies while the party remains in that
region.

### Befriend Animal 

An adventurer can make friends with a wild animal (a beast with a
challenge rating equal to or less than 1/3rd the party's total level) by
succeeding on an Animal Handling check.

Critical Failure. The adventurer scares or angers the animal,
which attacks them.

Failure. The adventurer is unable to befriend the animal.

Success. The adventurer befriends one animal. The animal
follows the party through the region until it spots danger. Adventurers
can assume that when the animal runs off that something dangerous is
following them or hidden nearby. The adventurer who befriended the
creature can then make a Perception check contested by the hidden
creature's Stealth check in order to spot the danger.

Critical Success. As a success, but the animal also leads the
adventurer to a Boon or Discovery. Additionally, the adventurer gains
advantage on their Perception check to spot a hidden danger. Only one
such boon can be gained per region.

### Busk 

Adventurers can entertain passersby with a successful Acrobatics,
Athletics, or Performance check.

Note: To perform this journey activity, the party must be in a
populated area such as a Country Shire, Open Roads, or an Urban
Township.

Critical Failure. Passersby steal 3d4 gold from the
adventurer.

Failure. The adventurer earns no money.

Success. The adventurer gains 1 gold per day of travel plus 1
gold for each point they beat the DC by.

Critical Success. The adventurer gains 2 gold per day of travel
plus 1 gold for each point they beat the DC by, and one passerby gifts
them with a random magical item worth 50 gold or less. Only one such
gift can be earned per region.

### Chronicle 

An adventurer that spends their time writing down observations of local
landmarks, recording various customs, or charting a map can make a
History check. The adventurer must spend the entire region undertaking
this activity.

Critical Failure. The adventurer slips, falls, or otherwise
bumbles during the journey, destroying their journaling scrolls or the
book they were writing in.

Failure. The adventurer fails to record anything of note or
value.

Success. The adventurer gains an expertise die on current or
future History or Survival checks made within or about the region.

Critical Success. As a success, and the adventurer discovers a
Boon or Discovery about the region. Only one such boon can be gained per
region.

### Cook 

By acting as the party's cook and quartermaster, with a cook's utensils
or Survival check an adventurer can help ensure that everybody remains
fed.

Critical Failure. For every two creatures being fed, the Supply
requirement to feed them is increased by 1 Supply.

Failure. The cooking is adequate, but has no special
effects.

Success.The daily Supply requirement to feed the party is
reduced by one-quarter (round down to a minimum of 1 Supply) up to a
maximum number of creatures equal to twice the adventurer's proficiency
bonus.

Critical Success. As a success, and each creature being fed
gains one additional hit die to spend on each day they are fed by the
adventurer.

### Cover Tracks 

While moving at a slow pace, an adventurer can cover the party's tracks
with a Survival check so that it is harder for pursuers to follow. The
adventurer's Survival check result is the DC for any pursuer's Survival
check to track them.

Critical Failure. The party leaves an obvious trail, and their
pursuers gain a day's worth of travel covering the distance between them
for each day spent doing this journey activity.

Failure. The party leaves a trail, and their pursuers continue
to harass them.

Success. The party manages to put an extra day between
themselves and their pursuers for each day spent doing this journey
activity.

Critical Success. The party lose their pursuers.

### Entertain 

With a successful Performance check an adventurer can help keep the
party's spirits high. Each party member can only benefit from this
journey activity once per week.

Critical Failure. The adventurer's performance is so bad that
the party gains a level of strife.

Failure. The party is not entertained.

Success. The first time the adventurer or an ally, up to a
number of creatures equal to the adventurer\'s proficiency bonus, would
suffer a level of strife, they do not. When there is more than one
member of the party that can benefit from this journey activity (like
when the entire party makes saving throws against strife at the same
time), the adventurer that performed chooses who benefits.

Critical Success. The adventurer and any allies each recover
one level of fatigue or strife. This benefit can only be gained by each
adventurer once per week.

### Gather Components 

Adventurers that gather supplies useful for the material components of
spellcasting can make an Arcana or Nature check.

Critical Failure. The adventurer accidentally picks components
about to decay or rot, destroying 1d4 gold worth of their own material
components before realizing it.

Failure. The adventurer finds no components.

Success. The adventurer finds 1d4 gold worth of components per
day, plus 1 gold worth of components for each point they beat the DC
by.

Critical Success. The adventurer finds 2d4 gold worth of
components per day, plus 1 gold worth of components for each point they
beat the DC by.

### Gossip 

Success on an Investigation or Persuasion check tells an adventurer the
local news and rumors.

Critical Failure. The party learns a false rumor.

Failure. The party gains no rumor.

Success. For each day spent doing this journey activity, the
Narrator reveals an engaging rumor or tidbit that could lead the party
on a new sidequest or support the main plot of the campaign.

Critical Success. As a success, and local gossip leads the
party to a Boon or Discovery.

### Harvest 

An adventurer that succeeds on a Medicine or Nature check finds plants
to refill a healer's satchel.

Critical Failure. The adventurer accidentally picks plants
about to decay or rot, destroying 1 use of their healer's satchel before
realizing it.

Failure. The adventurer finds no plants.

Success. The adventurer finds plants to refill 1 use of a
healer's satchel for each day spent doing this journey activity.

Critical Success. As a success, and the adventurer finds plants
which duplicate the effects of a potion of healing. This benefit can
only be gained once per week.

Alternatively, an adventurer can choose to make an herbalism kit check
or poisoner's kit check.

### Hunt and Gather 

It's often fruitful for an adventurer to track and kill game, or forage
for food and water, along the road with a Survival check.

Critical Failure. The adventurer gains toxic Supply, and the
entire party suffers a level of fatigue.

Failure. The adventurer gains no Supply.

Success. The adventurer gains 1 Supply per day spent doing this
journey activity.

Critical Success. The adventurer gains double the Supply.

### Pray 

While traveling many choose to connect with deities and spirits. An
adventurer makes a Religion check.

Critical Failure. The gods are displeased. Each party member
discovers that 1 Supply has spoiled.

Failure. The gods do not listen.

Success. The entire party gains advantage to one
ability check or attack made while within this region, and the gods lead
the adventurer to a Boon or Discovery.

Critical Success. The entire party gains an
expertise die on their next ability checks made in this region, and the
gods lead the adventurer to a Boon or Discovery.

### Rob 

Adventurers can force others into handing over their coins with a
successful Intimidation check, or pickpocket travelers with a successful
Sleight of Hand check. To perform this journey activity, the party must
be in a populated area such as a Country Shire, Open Roads, or Urban
Township. This journey activity usually takes a week to complete.

Critical Failure. A potential victim turns out to be a rival
adventuring party of similar capabilities and a fight ensues.

Failure. No gold is gained.

Success. The adventurer gains 1d8 gold per week of travel. When
this journey activity is done in fewer than 7 days, the adventurer
instead gains half as much gold (minimum 1 gold).

Critical Success. As a success, and the adventurer gains a
magic item worth 100 gold or less. This benefit can only be gained once
per region.

### Scout 

An adventurer roams at a distance from the party, making a Perception
check seeking vantage points to look ahead. This journey activity may
only be performed once per region.

Note: This journey activity may only be performed once per
region.

Critical Failure. The adventurer gets lost and suffers a level
of fatigue before returning to the party.

Failure. The adventurer learns nothing useful.

Success. The party automatically learns which regions adjoin
the current region. Additionally, the party gains advantage on
Perception checks made against any attempts to surprise or ambush them
while journeying through this region.

Critical Success. As a success, and the adventurer
finds a handy path. The party gains half a day's travel for each day
spent doing this journey activity.

### Track 

A designated tracker can ensure that the party remains on the trail of
their prey with a Survival check. This check is opposed by the Survival
check of the creature being tracked if it is attempting to hide its
tracks, or the region's journey activity DC if it is not.

Critical Failure. The party loses their prey.

Failure. The party falls back an extra day between
themselves and their prey for each day spent doing this journey
activity.

Success. The party continues to follow their prey.

Critical Success. The adventurer finds an obvious
trail, and the party gains a day's worth of travel covering the distance
between them and their prey for each day spent doing this journey
activity.

In some campaigns the wilderness is just the gap between dungeons and
plot points, and in others battling against the elements and nature is a
major focus. Consider the following two alternate methods of supply
tracking to better fit the campaign:

Casual Supplies. These rules are best used in adventures where
surviving the elements is not a major theme.

-   A creature is assumed to eat and care for itself as needed and
    rations are not tracked.
-   As long as a creature has access to its gear, it's assumed to have
    packed enough food and water to sustain itself during any
    journey.

Desperate Supplies. Adventures where wilderness survival is the
primary theme are best served with these rules.

-   All mundane consumable items must be tracked separately and must be
    stored in proper containers (see Containers, Chapter 4: Equipment in
    the Adventurer's Guide).
-   Throughout the course of a day, Medium-sized creatures must consume
    at least 1 pound of food and 1 gallon (8 pounds) of water (or half
    as much if Small-sized, or twice as much if Large-sized). When a
    creature completes a long rest without having consumed its required
    food and water, it gains a level of fatigue.

# Regions 

## Blasted Badlands 

These deserts are notorious for their many capricious ruins, the
devastated landscape the biggest mark left upon the world by the
forgotten civilizations that once flourished there. Monsters aplenty
roam the wastes as well, so adventurers journeying through it encounter
many creatures and constructed terrain exploration challenges.

Terrains. Desert, laboratory, mountains, ruins, subterranean,
swamp, temple, tomb.

Tiers. Blasted Badlands tend to be tier 2 and above.

Weather. 1–10 clear, 11–25 overcast.

Journey Activities. Adventurers gain advantage on checks made
to Scout, but disadvantage on checks made to Befriend Animal, Gossip,
and Rob. It is not possible to Busk, Harvest, or Hunt and Gather.

20–25 snow.

Friendly Locals. Adventurers gain an expertise die on Charisma checks made against people local to the region.

## Feywood 

Home to faeries, sprites, dryads, nymphs, satyrs, and other fey, the
animals in this forest are bold and only foolish travelers fail to
respect nature as they go along their way. Adventurers journeying
through regions like this contend with frequent combat encounters,
social encounters, and natural terrain and supernatural exploration
challenges.

Terrains. Forest, grassland, hills, jungle, mountains, ruins,
settlement, subterranean, swamp, temple, tomb.

Tiers. Feywoods often range from tier 1 through tier 4. While a
tier 1 Feywood presents little danger other than from wildlife and the
occasional faeries, a tier 4 Feywood might be a dangerous plane like the
Dreaming, or the domain of an ancient green dragon.

Weather. 1–15 clear, 16–19 mist, 20–25
rain.

Fey Promises. When an adventurer breaks a promise
made in a Feywood they suffer a level of strife.

Natural Camouflage. Adventurers gain an expertise
die on Stealth checks.

Journey Activities. When making a check to Harvest
or to Hunt and Gather, an adventurer rolls with advantage.

## Fiery Hellscape 

From active volcanoes to the hottest layers of Hell, these regions are
dominated by red-hot lava flows and flaming geysers. Adventurers
journeying through these regions can expect to encounter many natural
terrain challenges and dangerous creatures.

Terrains. Desert, laboratory, mountains, ruins, subterranean,
temple, tomb.

Tiers. These regions lend themselves towards danger and are
usually tier 3 or tier 4. A higher tier Fiery Hellscape might be found
on a plane of elemental fire or the volcanic domain of a red dragon.
Lower tier versions of these regions are rare, but might be found
naturally occurring in some places.

Weather. Uncomfortably warm.

Hot. Traveling at faster than a slow pace is dangerous in the
region's hot temperatures, and adventurers that do so suffer a level of
fatigue when taking a long rest (even if they have Supply). The use of
appropriate mounts (such as camels) and keeping a light pack (less than
half carrying capacity) allow for adventurers to travel as fast as a
normal pace without suffering fatigue during a long rest.

Unquenchable Thirst. Twice the usual amount of
Supply is required when taking a long rest.

Journey Activities. Checks to Harvest or Hunt and Gather are
made at disadvantage. It is not possible to Busk.

## Flowing River 

Rivers can provide a convenient and fast way to travel. Encounters are
less frequent, and the journey is less arduous.

region into one or more other regions.

above tier 2.

Weather. 1–8 clear, 9–12 overcast, 13–16 rain, 17–19 mist,
20–25 snow.

Vehicles. Adventurers move at the speed of their water
vehicles.

checks made to Hunt and Gather due to abundant fishing opportunities.
Checks made to Hide Tracks automatically succeed, and those made to
Track automatically fail. It is not possible to Busk.

## Frozen Wastes 

Endless fields of white and imposing mountains stretching towards the
sky fill this icy land, and though it is rather devoid of life it is a
place of great peril. Adventurers journeying through this region have to
overcome many natural terrain and weather event exploration challenges,
and perhaps a few combat or social encounters.

Terrains. Arctic, hills, mountains, ruins, subterranean,
temple, tomb, water.

Tiers. Arctic-like tundra can range from tier 2 to tier 4
depending on the severity of its climate.

Weather. 1–6 clear, 7–12 overcast, 13–25 snow.

Chilly. Without the proper gear or magic to survive the cold
temperatures (see Survival Gear), an adventurer suffers a level of
fatigue when taking a long rest in this environment (even if it has
Supply).

Journey Activities. Adventurers gain advantage on Survival
checks made to find a target using tracks left in the snow. Checks made
to hide tracks have disadvantage. It is not possible to Busk.

## Haunted Lands 

Settlements that have suffered a curse, or areas which are home to
powerful undead beings, typically have effects that spread far from the
source bringing woe to the people living nearby and attracting prowling
monsters and ominous signs. Adventurers journeying through regions like
this have plenty of combat encounters, some social encounters, and many
circumstance or supernatural exploration challenges.

Terrains. Any.

Tiers. Haunted lands are often higher tier areas. The corrupted
realm surrounding a dread knight's castle or a county ruled over by a
sinister vampire would likely be tier 3 or higher.

Weather. 1–5 clear, 6–10 overcast, 11–15 foggy, 16–25
rain.

Bleak Light. All light sources illuminate only half the area
they would normally cover.

Night Terrors. It is difficult to get a restful night's sleep
in this area. Adventurers make a Wisdom saving throw against the
region's journey activity DC when taking a long rest or suffer a level
of strife.

Suspicious Minds. The people who inhabit this area are wary and
suspicious of strangers. Adventurers have disadvantage on Charisma
checks made against people local to the region.

Journey Activities. The Entertain activity is made with
disadvantage. The Pray activity is made with disadvantage if your deity
has the Good alignment.

## Lofty Mountains 

Legends from all over the realm speak of remote passes, cataclysmic
conflicts and relics of fell power within the ancient ruins of temples
to defeated evils, the graves of terrible warlords, and sites of
unspeakable rituals. Adventurers journeying through this region have few
social encounters, a moderate amount of combat encounters, and many
constructed terrain, natural terrain, and supernatural exploration
challenges.

Terrains. Arctic, hills, jungle, mountains, ruins, settlement,
subterranean, temple, tomb.

Tiers. Idyllic mountain ranges might be tier 1, while cliffs
and crags ruled over by an ancient dragon would be tier 4.

Weather. 1–8 clear, 9–12 overcast, 13–16 mist, 17–18 rain,
19–25 snow.

Climbable. The terrain offers numerous footholds and pitted
surfaces. Adventurers gain an expertise die on checks made to
climb.

High Altitude. Breathing air gets harder at altitudes of 10,000
feet or higher above sea level, and adventurers not used to the reduced
oxygen tire easily. Every hour spent traveling at high altitude counts
as 2 hours of travel for the purposes of travel pace. For example, after
4 hours of travel a creature makes forced march checks every half
hour.

After spending 30 days or longer at high altitude an adventurer becomes
acclimated to it and can travel normally. Altitudes above 20,000 feet
can only be acclimated to by creatures native to the environment.

Mountsbane. Travel time is doubled for mounts and pack
animals.

## Open Roads 

Well-traveled roads with wide tracks, and plentiful inns, villages, and
other stopping points along the way make some journeys less arduous than
others. Adventurers journeying along country roads have many social
encounters, combat encounters with NPCs or the occasional wild beast,
and circumstance and constructed terrain exploration challenges.

Terrains. Any; most road regions extend from at least one
region into one or more other regions.

Tiers. It's unusual (although not impossible) for open roads to
be above tier 2.

Weather. 1–8 clear, 9–12 overcast, 13–16 rain, 17–19 mist,
20–25 snow.

Fast Travel. Adventurers move one mile per hour faster when
traveling along open roads.

## Parched Sands 

Endless dunes and the baking sun make these deserts difficult and
dangerous places in which to survive. Adventurers journeying through
this region have very few social encounters.

Terrains. Desert, grassland, hills, mountains, ruins,
settlement, subterranean, temple, tomb.

Tiers. A desert region with numerous oases might be tier 1, but
most are tier 2 or higher.

Weather. 1–25 clear.

Hot. Traveling at faster than a slow pace is dangerous in the
region's hot temperatures, and adventurers that do so suffer a level of
fatigue when taking a long rest (even if they have Supply). The use of
appropriate mounts (such as camels) and keeping a light pack (less than
half carrying capacity) allow for adventurers to travel as fast as a
normal pace without suffering fatigue during a long rest.

Unquenchable Thirst. Twice the usual amount of Supply is required when taking a long rest.

Journey Activities. It is not possible to Busk. Checks to Harvest or Hunt and Gather are made at disadvantage.

## Restless Sea 

Rapid currents and quick trade routes make these waters popular with
merchants, but only the bravest and most skilled sailors are willing to
chance the frequent, dangerous, and unpredictable waves. Adventurers
journeying through this region or along its coast have to overcome an
unusually high number of weather event exploration challenges, as well
as some combat encounters and social encounters.

Terrains. Coast, water.

Tiers. Regions with calm waters might be tier 1, but most
adventurous seas are tier 2 or tier 3.

Weather. 1–7 clear, 8–11 overcast, 12–16 rain, 17–25
mist.

Rolling Mists. Adventurers gain an expertise die on Stealth
checks if the weather is not clear.

Thick Fog. Without the sight of natural landmarks to guide
them, adventurers have disadvantage on checks made to navigate the area
if the weather is not clear.

Journey Activities. Adventurers have disadvantage on checks
made to Scout. Busking is possible on coastlines, but not the open sea.
Checks made to Hide Tracks on the open sea automatically succeed, and
those made to Track automatically fail. Checks to Hunt and Gather are
made with advantage.

## Urban Township 

From mighty sprawling cities to smaller bustling towns, these areas are
full of people–and more people means more accidents, more conflict,
and more action. Adventurers journeying through urban areas have many
social encounters, combat encounters against NPCs, and both circumstance
and constructed terrain exploration challenges.

Terrains. Settlement, sewer, temple.

Tiers. Metropolises can be as high as tier 4 and small towns as
low as tier 1.

Weather. 1–8 clear, 9–12 overcast, 13–16 rain, 17–19 mist,
20–25 snow.

Breakable Surroundings. A critical failure on a Strength or
Dexterity check results in destruction of property, angering the owner
of said property.

Journey Activities. Adventurers gain an expertise die on checks
made to Busk or Rob.

## Underland Realm 

There is no map–even among the subterranean cultures that dwell
within–that accurately depicts all of these enormous tunnels, which
range from natural caverns and dwarven mines to shadow elf cities.
Adventurers journeying through this region have combat encounters, some
social encounters, and many constructed terrain, natural terrain, and
supernatural exploration challenges.

Terrains. Forest, jungle, laboratory, ruins, settlement,
subterranean, swamp, temple, tomb, water.

Tiers. It's unusual for these regions to be less than tier
2.

Weather. 1–16 clear, 17–25 mist.

Resonant. Adventurers gain an expertise die on sound-based
Perception checks.

Unstable. When an adventurer creates a force that would disturb
a non-stoneworked area (an explosion, loud sound, or shaping the
structure of the cave through magic), roll 1d20. On a result of 20 the
activity causes a cave-in. One passageway in the cave is filled with
fallen rocks 20 feet wide.

## Unrelenting Marsh 

So named because time seems to slow to a crawl while traversing its
swamps, this area is rife with dangerous predators, lethal fauna, and
ground best left untrusted. Adventurers journeying through this region
have frequent combat encounters, a few social encounters, and many
natural terrain exploration challenges.

Terrains. Forest, grassland, hills, jungle, ruins, settlement,
swamp, temple, tomb, water.

Tiers. Swamp regions with friendly inhabitants might be tier 1,
but more hostile places (oft ruled over by ancient dragons or worse) can
easily be tier 4.

Weather. 1–5 clear, 6–8 overcast, 9–15 rain, 16–25
mist.

Hard to Hoof. Mounts and pack animals are unable to travel at a
fast pace or gallop pace. Additionally, wheeled vehicles cannot travel
faster than a crawl.

Journey Activities. Plants harvested during a journey activity
are typically very rare. Adventurers gain an expertise die on checks
made to Harvest, but on a critical failure the plants are carnivorous,
and the adventurer suffers one level of fatigue.

## Wartorn Kingdom 

An occupied nation, or one amidst a civil war, is a dubious place
populated with aggressive soldiers, desperate commoners, and merciless
opportunists. Adventurers journeying through this region have many
social encounters, combat encounters against NPCs, and both circumstance
and natural terrain exploration challenges as they navigate the country
in conflict.

Terrains. Any.

Tiers. Nascent counties skirmishing against one another might
merit tier 1, but when larger nations take umbrage against one another
they usually merit being tier 2 or even tier 3.

Weather. 1–8 clear, 9–12 overcast, 13–16 rain, 17–19 mist,
20–25 snow. The Narrator may substitute a weather roll based on the
terrain (like rolling a Lofty Mountains weather roll in a Wartorn
Kingdom in a mountain range).

Journey Activities. The Busk journey activity is made with
disadvantage due to the wary and suspicious nature of other
travelers.

## Dungeons 

Desolate crypts, ancient temples, horrifying tombs, and cursed pyramids
are often filled with traps and monsters. Unlike the natural caverns of
most of the underland realm, a dungeon is usually constructed and can be
above or below ground. Although dungeons aren't regions (so there is no
weather or travel scenery, and adventurers don't undertake journey
activities in a dungeon) they are filled with random encounters against
both traps and monsters, and these areas are ripe with opportunities for
exploration!

Terrains. Dungeons can be found everywhere, and depending on
their size and location they may have a wide variety of terrains within
(though laboratory, ruins, sewer, temple, and tomb are the most
common).

Tier. Dungeons range from tier 0 crypts in small villages all
the way up to the deadliest tier 4 labyrinths of terror constructed by
ancient evils.

## Travel Scenery 

The world is a fascinating place and across their journeys the
adventurers are bound to see some things that are interesting or
extraordinary yet pose no threat or danger. Narrators can use travel
scenery to heighten the sense of adventure and mystery, introduce new
quests, or tweak them to help guide a wayward party back to an important
task they've left unfinished.
