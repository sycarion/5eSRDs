Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
