You animate the shadow of a creature within range, causing it to attack that creature. As a bonus action when you cast the spell, or as an action on subsequent rounds while you maintain concentration, make a melee spell attack against the creature. If it hits, the target takes 2d8 psychic damage and must make a successful Intelligence saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
