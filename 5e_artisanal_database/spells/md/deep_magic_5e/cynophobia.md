Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or develop an overriding fear of canids, such as dogs, wolves, foxes, and worgs. For the duration, the first time the target sees a canid, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of that canid until the end of its next turn. Each time the target sees a different canid, it must make the saving throw. In addition, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while a canid is within 10 feet of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 24 hours. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 month. When you use a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.
