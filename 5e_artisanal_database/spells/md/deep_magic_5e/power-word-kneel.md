When you shout this word of power, creatures within 20 feet of a point you specify are compelled to kneel down facing you. A kneeling creature is treated as prone. Up to 55 hit points of creatures are affected, beginning with those that have the fewest hit points. A kneeling creature makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. The effect ends immediately on any creature that takes damage while kneeling.
