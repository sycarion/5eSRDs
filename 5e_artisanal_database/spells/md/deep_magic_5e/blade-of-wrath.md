You create a sword of pure white fire in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and it lasts for the duration. The blade disappears if you let go of it, but you can call it forth again as a bonus action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 fire damage and 2d8 radiant damage. An aberration, fey, fiend, or undead creature damaged by the blade must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of your next turn.

The blade sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, either the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
