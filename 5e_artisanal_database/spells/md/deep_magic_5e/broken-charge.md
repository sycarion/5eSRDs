When an enemy that you can see moves to within 5 feet of you, you utter a perplexing word that alters the foeâ€™s course. The enemy must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage and use the remainder of its speed to move in a direction of your choosing.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the target takes an additional 2d4 psychic damage for each slot level above 1st.
