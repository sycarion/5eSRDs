Choose one creature you can see within range that isnâ€™t a construct or an undead. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. While cursed, the target reeks of death and rot, and nothing short of magic can mask or remove the smell. The target has disadvantage on all Charisma checks and on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells. A creature with the Keen Smell trait, or a similar trait indicating the creature has a strong sense of smell, can add your spellcasting ability modifier to its Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to find the target. A remove curse spell or similar magic ends the spell early.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.
