A warping, prismatic aura surrounds and outlines each creature inside a 10-foot cube within range. The aura sheds dim light out to 10 feet, and the the locations of hidden or invisible creatures are outlined. If a creature in the area tries to cast a spell or use a magic item, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell or item functions normally. On a failed save, the effect of the spell or the item is suppressed for the duration of the aura. Time spent suppressed counts against the duration of the spell’s or item’s effect.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a 9th‐level spell slot, the cube is 20 feet on a side.
