Your kind words offer hope and support to a fallen comrade. Choose a willing creature you can see within range that is about to make a death saving throw. The creature gains advantage on the saving throw, and if the result of the saving throw is 18 or higher, the creature regains 3d4 hit points immediately.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the creature adds 1 to its death saving throw for every two slot levels above 1st and regains an additional 1d4 hit points for each slot level above 1st if its saving throw result is 18 or higher.
