Touch a living creature (not a construct or undead) as you cast the spell. The next time that creature takes damage, it immediately regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
