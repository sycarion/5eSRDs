You create a glowing arrow of necrotic magic and command it to strike a creature you can see within range. The arrow can have one of two effects; you choose which at the moment of casting. If you make a successful ranged spell attack, you and the target experience the desired effect. If the attack misses, the spell fails.
* The arrow deals 2d6 necrotic damage to the target, and you heal the same amount of hit points.
* You take 2d6 necrotic damage, and the target heals the same amount of hit points.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spellâ€™s damage and hit points healed increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
