Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and, if it is not an undead creature, it is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
