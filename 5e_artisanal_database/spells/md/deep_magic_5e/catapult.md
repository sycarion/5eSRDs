You magically hurl an object or creature weighing 500 pounds or less 40 feet through the air in a direction of your choosing (including straight up). Objects hurled at specific targets require a spell attack roll to hit. A thrown creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage from the force of the throw, plus any appropriate falling damage, and lands prone. If the target of the spell is thrown against another creature, the total damage is divided evenly between them and both creatures are knocked prone.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10, the distance thrown increases by 10 feet, and the weight thrown increases by 100 pounds for each slot level above 6th.
