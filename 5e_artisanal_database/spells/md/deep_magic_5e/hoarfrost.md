A melee weapon you are holding is imbued with cold. For the duration, a rime of frost covers the weapon and light vapor rises from it if the temperature is above freezing. The weapon becomes magical and deals an extra 1d4 cold damage on a successful hit. The spell ends after 1 minute, or earlier if you make a successful attack with the weapon or let go of it.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
