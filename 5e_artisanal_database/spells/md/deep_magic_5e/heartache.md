You force an enemy to experience pangs of unrequited love and emotional distress. These feelings manifest with such intensity that the creature takes 5d6 psychic damage on a failed Charisma saving throw, or half the damage on a successful save.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target an additional enemy for each slot level above 2nd.
