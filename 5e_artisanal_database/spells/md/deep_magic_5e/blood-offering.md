You touch the corpse of a creature that isn’t undead or a construct and consume its life force. You must have dealt damage to the creature before it died, and it must have been dead for no more than 1 hour. You regain a number of hit points equal to 1d4 × the creature's challenge rating (minimum of 1d4). The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
