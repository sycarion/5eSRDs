Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, which it makes with disadvantage if itâ€™s in an enclosed space. On a failed save, the creature believes the world around it is closing in and threatening to crush it. Even in open or clear terrain, the creature feels as though it is sinking into a pit, or that the land is rising around it. The creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration, and it takes 2d6 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
