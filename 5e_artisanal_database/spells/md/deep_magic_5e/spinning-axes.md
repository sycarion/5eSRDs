Spinning axes made of luminous force burst out from you to strike all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each of those creatures takes 5d8 force damage, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Creatures damaged by this spell that arenâ€™t undead or constructs begin bleeding. A bleeding creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute. A creature can stop the bleeding for itself or another creature by using an action to make a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC or by applying any amount of magical healing.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
