With a thunderous battle cry, you move up to 10 feet in a straight line and make a melee weapon attack. If it hits, you can choose to either gain a +5 bonus on the attackâ€™s damage or shove the target 10 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the distance you can move increases by 10 feet, and the attack deals an additional 1d6 thunder damage, for each slot level above 1st.
