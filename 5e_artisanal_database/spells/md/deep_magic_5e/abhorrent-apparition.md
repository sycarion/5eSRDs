# Abhorrent Apparition

- **Level**: 4 illusion
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: M (a gourd with a face carved on it)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

You imbue a terrifying visage onto a gourd and toss it ahead of you to a spot of your choosing within range. Each creature within 15 feet of that spot takes 6d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for 1 minute; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the fright. A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
