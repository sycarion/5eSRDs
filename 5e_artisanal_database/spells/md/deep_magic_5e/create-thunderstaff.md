# Create Thunderstaff

- **Level**: 7 transmutation
- **Classes**: 
- **Casting Time**: 10 minutes
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a quarterstaff)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

After you cast **create thunderstaff** on a normal quarterstaff, the staff must then be mounted in a noisy location, such as a busy marketplace, and left there for 60 days. During that time, the staff gradually absorbs ambient sound.

After 60 days, the staff is fully charged and canâ€™t absorb any more sound. At that point, it becomes a **thunderstaff**, a +1 quarterstaff that has 10 charges. When you hit on a melee attack with the staff and expend 1 charge, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage. You can cast a thunderwave spell from the staff as a bonus action by expending 2 charges. The staff cannot be recharged.

If the final charge is not expended within 60 days, the staff becomes nonmagical again.
