When **daggerhawk** is cast on a nonmagical dagger, a ghostly hawk appears around the weapon. The hawk and dagger fly into the air and make a melee attack against one creature you select within 60 feet, using your spell attack modifier and dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier on a hit. On your subsequent turns, you can use an action to cause the daggerhawk to attack the same target. The daggerhawk has AC 14 and, although it’s invulnerable to all damage, a successful attack against it that deals bludgeoning, force, or slashing damage sends the daggerhawk tumbling, so it can’t attack again until after your next turn.
