You view the actions of a single creature you can see through the influence of the stars, and you read what is written there. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you can predict that creature’s actions. This has the following effects:
* You have advantage on attack rolls against the target.
* For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the target’s turn when it has completed its movement. This is deducted from your next turn’s movement.
* As a reaction at the start of the target’s turn, you can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the target’s offensive intentions; any creature targeted by the target’s next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its saving throw against that attack.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.
