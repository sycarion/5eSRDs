You call upon morning to arrive ahead of schedule. With a sharp word, you create a 30-foot-radius cylinder of light centered on a point on the ground within range. The cylinder extends vertically for 100 feet or until it reaches an obstruction, such as a ceiling. The area inside the cylinder is brightly lit.
