You conjure a minor celestial manifestation to protect a creature you can see within range. A faintly glowing image resembling a human head and shoulders hovers within 5 feet of the target for the duration. The manifestation moves to interpose itself between the target and any incoming attacks, granting the target a +2 bonus to AC.

Also, the first time the target gets a failure on a Dexterity saving throw while the spell is active, it can use its reaction to reroll the save. The spell then ends.
