By making mocking gestures toward one creature within
range that can see you, you leave the creature incapable of
performing at its best. If the target fails on an Intelligence
saving throw, roll a d4 and refer to the following table to
determine what the target does on its turn. An affected
target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success or applying
the result of another roll on the table on a failure.

| D4 | RESULT |
|---|---|
| 1 | Target spends its turn shouting mocking words at caster and takes a -5 penalty to its initiative roll. |
| 2 | Target stands transfixed and blinking, takes no action. |
| 3 | Target flees or fights (50 percent chance of each). |
| 4 | Target charges directly at caster, enraged. |
