By harnessing the elemental power of fire, you warp nearby air into obscuring smoke. One creature you can see within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, the creature is blinded until the start of your next turn. **Puff of smoke** has no effect on creatures that have tremorsense or blindsight.
