With a short phrase of Void Speech, you gather writhing darkness around your hand. When you cast the spell, and as an action on subsequent turns while you maintain concentration, you can unleash a bolt of darkness at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. If the target is in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on the roll. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 necrotic damage and is frightened of you until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast the spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
