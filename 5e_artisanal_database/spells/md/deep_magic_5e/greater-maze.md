This spell functions as maze, but the target must make a Dexterity saving throw each time it starts its turn in the maze. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

Escaping this maze is especially difficult. To do so, the target must use an action to make a DC 20 Intelligence check. It escapes when it makes its second successful check.
