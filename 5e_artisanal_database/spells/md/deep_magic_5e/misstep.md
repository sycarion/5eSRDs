You gesture to a creature within range that you can see. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it uses its reaction to move 5 feet in a direction you dictate. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The spell automatically fails if you direct the target into a dangerous area such as a pit trap, a bonfire, or off the edge of a cliff, or if the target has already used its reaction.
