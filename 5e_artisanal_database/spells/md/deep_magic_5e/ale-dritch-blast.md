A stream of ice-cold ale blasts from your outstretched hands toward a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage and it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. A targeted creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it has drunk any alcohol within the last hour.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases when you reach higher levels: 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.
