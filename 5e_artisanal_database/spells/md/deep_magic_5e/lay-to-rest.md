A pulse of searing light rushes out from you. Each undead creature within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  An undead creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell disintegrates in a burst of radiant motes, leaving anything it was wearing or carrying in a space it formerly occupied.
