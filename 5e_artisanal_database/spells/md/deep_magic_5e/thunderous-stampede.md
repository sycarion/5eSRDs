This spell acts as thunderous charge, but affecting up to three targets within range, including yourself. A target other than you must use its reaction to move and attack under the effect of thunderous stampede.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the distance your targets can move increases by 10 feet, and the attack deals an additional 1d6 thunder damage, for each slot level above 2nd.
