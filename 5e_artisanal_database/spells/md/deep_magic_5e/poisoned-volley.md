By drawing back and releasing an imaginary bowstring, you summon forth dozens of glowing green arrows. The arrows dissipate when they hit, but all creatures in a 20-foot square within range take 3d8 poison damage and become poisoned. A creature that makes a successful Constitution saving throw takes half as much damage and is not poisoned.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
