- **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when your ally is hit by an attack or is targeted by a spell that deals damage other than psychic damage
- **Range**: 60 feet

When you see an ally within range in imminent danger, you can use your reaction to protect that creature with a shield of magical force. Until the start of your next turn, your ally has a +5 bonus to AC and is immune to force damage. In addition, if your ally must make a saving throw against an enemyâ€™s spell that deals damage, the ally takes half as much damage on a failed saving throw and no damage on a successful save. Ally aegis offers no protection, however, against psychic damage from any source.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional ally for each slot level above 6th.
