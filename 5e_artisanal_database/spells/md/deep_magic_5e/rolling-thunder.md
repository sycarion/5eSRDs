# Rolling Thunder

- **Level**: 2 evocation
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

- **Range**: Self (30-foot line)

- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

A tremendous bell note explodes from your outstretched hand and rolls forward in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. A creature made of material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on its saving throw against this spell.

While a creature is deafened in this way, it is wreathed in thundering energy; it takes 2d8 thunder damage at the start of its turn, and its speed is halved. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
