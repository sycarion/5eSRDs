You make one living creature or plant within range move rapidly in time compared to you. The target becomes one year older. For example, you could cast this spell on a seedling, which causes the plant to sprout from the soil, or you could cast this spell on a newly hatched duckling, causing it to become a full-grown duck. If the target is a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to resist the aging. It can choose to fail the saving throw.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the targetâ€™s age by one additional year for each slot level above 4th.
