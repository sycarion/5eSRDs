# Keening Wail

- **Level**: 4 necromancy
- **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Warlock
- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self (15-foot cone)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a ringed lock of hair from an undead creature)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

You emit an unholy shriek from beyond the grave. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature with 50 hit points or fewer fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is instead reduced to 0 hit points. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
