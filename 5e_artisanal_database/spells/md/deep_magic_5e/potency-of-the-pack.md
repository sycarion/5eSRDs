You bestow lupine traits on a group of living creatures that you designate within range. Choose one of the following benefits to be gained by all targets for the duration:

* ***Thick Fur.*** Each target sprouts fur over its entire body, giving it a +2 bonus to Armor Class.
* ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** Each target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
* ***Pack Tactics.*** Each affected creature has advantage on an attack roll against a target if at least one of the attacker’s allies (also under the effect of this spell) is within 5 feet of the target of the attack and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 minute for each slot level above 3rd.
