By touching a page of written information, you can encode its contents. All creatures that try to read the information when its contents are encoded see the markings on the page as nothing but gibberish. The effect ends when either **encrypt / decrypt** or dispel magic is cast on the encoded writing, which turns it back into its normal state.
