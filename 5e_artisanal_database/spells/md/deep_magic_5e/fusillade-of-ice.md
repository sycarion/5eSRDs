**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by your choice of 1d6 cold damage or 1d6 piercing damage for each slot level above 4th. You can make a different choice (cold damage or piercing damage) for each slot level above 4th. Casting this spell with a spell slot of 6th level or higher increases the range to a 60-foot cone.
