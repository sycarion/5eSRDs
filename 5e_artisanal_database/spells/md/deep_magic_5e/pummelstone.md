You cause a fist-sized chunk of stone to appear and hurl itself against the spell’s target. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and must roll a d4 when it makes an attack roll or ability check during its next turn, subtracting the result of the d4 from the attack or check roll.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
