This spell invokes the deepest part of night on the winter solstice. You target a 40-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range, which is plunged into darkness and unbearable cold. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of its turn must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures immune to cold damage are also immune to the exhaustion effect, as are creatures wearing cold weather gear or otherwise adapted for a cold environment.

As a bonus action, you can move the center of the effect 20 feet.
