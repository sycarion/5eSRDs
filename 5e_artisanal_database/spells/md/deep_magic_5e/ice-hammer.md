When you cast **ice hammer**, a warhammer fashioned from ice appears in your hands. This weapon functions as a standard warhammer in all ways, and it deals an extra 1d10 cold damage on a hit. You can drop the warhammer or give it to another creature.

The warhammer melts and is destroyed when it or its user accumulates 20 or more fire damage, or when the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can create one additional hammer for each slot level above 2nd. Alternatively, you can create half as many hammers (round down), but each is oversized (1d10 bludgeoning damage, or 1d12 if wielded with two hands, plus 2d8 cold damage). Medium or smaller creatures have disadvantage when using oversized weapons, even if they are proficient with them.
