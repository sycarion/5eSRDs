You inspire allies to fight with the savagery of berserkers. You and any allies you can see within range have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and a +2 bonus to damage with melee weapons.

When the spell ends, each affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain 1d4 levels of exhaustion.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus to damage increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.
