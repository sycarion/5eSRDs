A pit opens under a Huge or smaller creature you can see within range that does not have a flying speed. This pit isnâ€™t a simple hole in the floor or ground, but a passage to an extradimensional space. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit, which closes over it. At the end of your next turn, a new portal opens 20 feet above where the pit was located, and the creature falls out. It lands prone and takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage.

If the original target makes a successful saving throw, you can use a bonus action on your turn to reopen the pit in any location within range that you can see. The spell ends when a creature has fallen through the pit and taken damage, or when the duration expires.
