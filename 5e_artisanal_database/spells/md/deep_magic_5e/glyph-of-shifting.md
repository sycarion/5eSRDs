You create a hidden glyph by tracing it on a surface or object that you touch. When you cast the spell, you can also choose a location that's known to you, within 5 miles, and on the same plane of existence, to serve as the destination for the glyph's shifting effect.
  The glyph is triggered when it's touched by a creature that's not aware of its presence. The triggering creature must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to the glyph's destination. If no destination was set, the creature takes 4d4 force damage and is knocked prone.
  The glyph disappears after being triggered or when the spell's duration expires.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, its duration increases by 24 hours and the maximum distance to the destination increases by 5 miles for each slot level above 2nd.
