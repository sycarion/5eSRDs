When you cast this spell, the piercing rays of a day’s worth of sunlight reflecting off fresh snow blankets the area. A creature caught in the spell’s area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on ranged attacks and Wisdom (Perception) checks for the duration of the spell. In addition, an affected creature’s vision is hampered such that foes it targets are treated as having three-quarters cover.
