A freezing blast of shadow explodes out from you in a 10-foot cone. Any creature caught in the shadow takes 2d4 necrotic damage and is frightened; a successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage and negates the frightened condition.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage dealt by the attack increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.
