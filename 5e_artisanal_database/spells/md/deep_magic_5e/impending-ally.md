You summon a duplicate of yourself as an ally who appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. You control this ally, whose turn comes immediately after yours. When you or the ally uses a class feature, spell slot, or other expendable resource, itâ€™s considered expended for both of you. When the spell ends, or if you are killed, the ally disappears immediately.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for every two slot levels above 3rd.
