You infuse two metal rings with magic, causing them to revolve in a slow orbit around your head or hand. For the duration, when you hit a target within 60 feet of you with an attack, you can launch one of the rings to strike the target as well. The target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet directly away from you. The ring is destroyed when it strikes.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect up to two additional rings for each spell slot level above 1st.
