When you cast **hobble mount** as a successful melee spell attack against a horse, wolf, or other four-legged or two-legged beast being ridden as a mount, that beast is disabled so that it canâ€™t move at its normal speed without incurring injury. An affected creature that moves more than half its base speed in a turn takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

This spell has no effect on a creature that your GM deems to not be a mount.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 1st.
