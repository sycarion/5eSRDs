The ground thrusts sharply upward along a 5-foot-wide, 60‐foot-long line that you designate. All spaces affected by the spell become difficult terrain. In addition, all creatures in the affected area are knocked prone and take 8d6 bludgeoning damage. Creatures that make a successful Dexterity saving throw take half as much damage and are not knocked prone. This spell doesn’t damage permanent structures.
