You clap your hands, emitting a peal of thunder. Each creature within 20 feet of you takes 8d4 thunder damage and is deafened for 1d8 rounds, or it takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened if it makes a successful Constitution saving throw. On a saving throw that fails by 5 or more, the creature is also stunned for 1 round.

This spell doesn’t function in an area affected by a silence spell. Very brittle material such as crystal might be shattered if it’s within range, at the GM’s discretion; a character holding such an object can protect it from harm by making a successful Dexterity saving throw.
