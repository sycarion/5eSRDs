You launch a swirling ray of disruptive energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the creature takes 6d8 necrotic damage and its maximum hit points are reduced by an equal amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest, or until it receives the benefit of a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.

This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.
