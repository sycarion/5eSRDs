Your magic haunts the dreams of others. Choose a sleeping creature that you are aware of within range. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be targeted. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it garners no benefit from the rest, and when it awakens, it gains one level of exhaustion and is afflicted with short‑term madness.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
