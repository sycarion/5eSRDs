You attempt to afflict a humanoid you can see within range with memories of distant, alien realms and their peculiar inhabitants. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with a form of long-term madness and be charmed by you for the duration of the spell or until you or one of your allies harms it in any way. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as a sacred monarch. If you or an ally of yours is fighting the creature, it has advantage on its saving throw.

A successful remove curse spell ends both effects.
