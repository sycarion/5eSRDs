Your touch can siphon energy from undead to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against an undead creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 radiant damage, and you or an ally within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the amount of radiant damage dealt. If used on an ally, this effect can restore the ally to no more than half of the ally's hit point maximum. This effect can't heal an undead or a construct. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
