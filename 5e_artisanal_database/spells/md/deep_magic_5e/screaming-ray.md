You create a ray of psychic energy to attack your enemies. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and is deafened until the end of your next turn. If the target succeeds on a Constitution saving throw, it is not deafened.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 1st. You can direct the rays at one target or several.
