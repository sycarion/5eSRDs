You instill primal fury into a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw. On a failure, the target must use its action to attack its nearest enemy it can see with unarmed strikes or natural weapons. For the duration, the target’s attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type dealt by its weapon, and the target can’t be charmed or frightened. If there are no enemies within reach, the target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
