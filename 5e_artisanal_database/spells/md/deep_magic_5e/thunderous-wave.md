You initiate a shock wave centered at a point you designate within range. The wave explodes outward into a 30-foot-radius sphere. This force deals no damage directly, but every creature the wave passes through must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 30 feet and knocked prone; if it strikes a solid obstruction, it also takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, a creature is pushed 15 feet and not knocked prone, and it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage if it strikes an obstruction. The spell also emits a thunderous boom that can be heard within 400 feet.
