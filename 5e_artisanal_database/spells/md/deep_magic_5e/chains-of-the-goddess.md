Choose a creature you can see within 90 feet. The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be restrained by chains of psychic force and take 6d8 bludgeoning damage. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. While restrained in this way, the creature also takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns.
