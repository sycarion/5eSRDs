You touch a willing creature and create a shimmering shield of energy to protect it. The shield grants the target a +5 bonus to AC and gives it resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the duration of the spell.

In addition, the shield can reflect hostile spells back at their casters. When the target makes a successful saving throw against a hostile spell, the caster of the spell immediately becomes the spell’s new target. The caster is entitled to the appropriate saving throw against the returned spell, if any, and is affected by the spell as if it came from a spellcaster of the caster’s level.
