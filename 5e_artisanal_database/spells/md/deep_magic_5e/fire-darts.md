When this spell is cast on any fire thatâ€™s at least as large as a small campfire or cooking fire, three darts of flame shoot out from the fire toward creatures within 30 feet of the fire. Darts can be directed against the same or separate targets as the caster chooses. Each dart deals 4d6 fire damage, or half as much damage if its target makes a successful Dexterity saving throw.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
