You create an arrow of eldritch energy and send it at a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 force damage, and it can’t take reactions until the end of its next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
