By harnessing the power of ice and frost, you emanate pure cold, filling a 30-foot-radius sphere. Creatures other than you in the sphere take 10d8 cold damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature killed by this spell is transformed into ice, leaving behind no trace of its original body.
