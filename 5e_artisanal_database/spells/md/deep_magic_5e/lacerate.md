You make a swift cutting motion through the air to lacerate a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 4d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the wound erupts with a violent spray of blood, and the target gains one level of exhaustion.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
