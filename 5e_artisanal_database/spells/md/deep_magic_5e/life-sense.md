For the duration, you can sense the location of any creature that isn’t a construct or an undead within 30 feet of you, regardless of impediments to your other senses. This spell doesn’t sense creatures that are dead. A creature trying to hide its life force from you can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, you can’t sense the creature with this casting of the spell. If you cast the spell again, the creature must make the saving throw again to remain hidden from your senses.
