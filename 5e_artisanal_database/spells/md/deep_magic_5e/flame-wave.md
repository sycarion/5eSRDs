A rushing burst of fire rips out from you in a rolling wave, filling a 40-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 fire damage and is pushed 20 feet away from you on a failed save; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t pushed.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
