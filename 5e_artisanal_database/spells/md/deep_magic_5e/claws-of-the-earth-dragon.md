You summon the power of the earth dragon and shoot a ray at one target within 60 feet. The target falls prone and takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage from being slammed to the ground. If the target was flying or levitating, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet it falls. If the target makes a successful Strength saving throw, damage is halved, it doesn’t fall, and it isn’t knocked prone.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage done by the attack increases by 1d8 and the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 5th.
