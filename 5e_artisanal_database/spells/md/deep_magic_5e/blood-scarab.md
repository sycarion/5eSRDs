# Blood Scarab

- **Level**: 1 necromancy
- **Classes**: Cleric, Warlock
- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, M (a drop of the caster’s blood, and the exoskeleton of a scarab beetle)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

Your blood is absorbed into the beetle’s exoskeleton to form a beautiful, rubylike scarab that flies toward a creature of your choice within range. The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage. You gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of scarabs increases by one for each slot level above 1st. You can direct the scarabs at the same target or at different targets. Each target makes a single saving throw, regardless of the number of scarabs targeting it.
