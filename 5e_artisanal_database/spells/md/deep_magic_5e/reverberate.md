You touch the ground at your feet with the metal ring, creating an impact that shakes the earth ahead of you. Creatures and unattended objects touching the ground in a 15-foot cone emanating from you take 4d6 thunder damage, and creatures fall prone; a creature that makes a successful Dexterity saving throw takes half the damage and does not fall prone.
