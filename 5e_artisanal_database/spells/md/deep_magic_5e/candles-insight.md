**Candle’s insight** is cast on its target as the component candle is lit. The candle burns for up to 10 minutes unless it’s extinguished normally or by the spell’s effect. While the candle burns, the caster can question the spell’s target, and the candle reveals whether the target speaks truthfully. An intentionally misleading or partial answer causes the flame to flicker and dim. An outright lie causes the flame to flare and then go out, ending the spell. The candle judges honesty, not absolute truth; the flame burns steadily through even an outrageously false statement, as long as the target believes it’s true.

**Candle’s insight** is used across society: by merchants while negotiating deals, by inquisitors investigating heresy, and by monarchs as they interview foreign diplomats. In some societies, casting candle’s insight without the consent of the spell’s target is considered a serious breach of hospitality.
