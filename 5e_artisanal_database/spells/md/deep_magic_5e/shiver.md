You fill a humanoid creature with such cold that its teeth begin to chatter and its body shakes uncontrollably. Roll 5d8; the total is the maximum hit points of a creature this spell can affect. The affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it cannot cast a spell or load a missile weapon until the end of your next turn. Once a creature has been affected by this spell, it is immune to further castings of this spell for 24 hours.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The maximum hit points you can affect increases by 4d8 when you reach 5th level (9d8), 11th level (13d8), and 17th level (17d8).
