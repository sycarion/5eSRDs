Biting cold settles onto a creature you can see. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 cold damage. In addition, for the duration of the spell, the creatureâ€™s speed is halved, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and it takes another 4d8 cold damage at the start of each of its turns.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. The effect ends when the creature makes its third successful save.

Creatures that are immune to cold damage are unaffected by **frostbite**.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target two additional creatures for each slot level above 5th.
