You cause a creature's lungs to fill with seawater. Unless the target makes a successful Constitution saving throw, it immediately begins suffocating. A suffocating creature can’t speak or perform verbal spell components. It can hold its breath, and thereafter can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round), after which it drops to 0 hit points and is dying. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected, as are creatures that can breathe water or that don’t require air.

A suffocating (not dying) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

NOTE: Midgard Heroes Handbook has a very different [drown-heroes-handbook/drown](https://api.open5e.com/spells/drown) spell.
