You whisper in Void Speech and touch a weapon. Until the spell ends, the weapon turns black, becomes magical if it wasn’t before, and deals 2d6 necrotic damage (in addition to its normal damage) on a successful hit. A creature that takes necrotic damage from the enchanted weapon can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
