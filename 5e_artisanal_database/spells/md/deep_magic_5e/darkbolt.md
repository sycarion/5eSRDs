You utter a quick invocation to create a black nimbus around your hand, then hurl three rays of darkness at one or more targets in range. The rays can be divided between targets however you like. Make a ranged spell attack for each target (not each ray); each ray that hits deals 1d10 cold damage. A target that was hit by one or more rays must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be unable to use reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.
