# Ice Soldiers

- **Level**: 7 conjuration
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, M (vial of water)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

You pour water from the vial and cause two ice soldiers to appear within range. The ice soldiers cannot form if there is no space available for them. The ice soldiers act immediately on your turn. You can mentally command them (no action required by you) to move and act where and how you desire. If you command an ice soldier to attack, it attacks that creature exclusively until the target is dead, at which time the soldier melts into a puddle of water. If an ice soldier moves farther than 30 feet from you, it immediately melts.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you create one additional ice soldier.
