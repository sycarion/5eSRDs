You detect precious metals, gems, and jewelry within 60 feet. You do not discern their exact location, only their presence and direction. Their exact location is revealed if you are within 10 feet of the spot.

**Enhance greed** penetrates barriers but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of dirt or wood.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 1 minute, and another 10 feet can be added to its range, for each slot level above 2nd.
