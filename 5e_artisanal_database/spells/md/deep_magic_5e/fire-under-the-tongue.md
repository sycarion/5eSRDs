You can ingest a nonmagical fire up to the size of a normal campfire that is within range. The fire is stored harmlessly in your mouth and dissipates without effect if it is not used before the spell ends. You can spit out the stored fire as an action. If you try to hit a particular target, then treat this as a ranged attack with a range of 5 feet. Campfire-sized flames deal 2d6 fire damage, while torch-sized flames deal 1d6 fire damage. Once you have spit it out, the fire goes out immediately unless it hits flammable material that can keep it fed.
