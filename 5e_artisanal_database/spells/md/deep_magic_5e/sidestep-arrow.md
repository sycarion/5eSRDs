With a few perfectly timed steps, you interpose a foe between you and danger. You cast this spell when an enemy makes a ranged attack or a ranged spell attack against you but before the attack is resolved. At least one other foe must be within 10 feet of you when you cast **sidestep arrow**. As part of casting the spell, you can move up to 15 feet to a place where an enemy lies between you and the attacker. If no such location is available, the spell has no effect. You must be able to move (not restrained or grappled or prevented from moving for any other reason), and this move does not provoke opportunity attacks. After you move, the ranged attack is resolved with the intervening foe as the target instead of you.
