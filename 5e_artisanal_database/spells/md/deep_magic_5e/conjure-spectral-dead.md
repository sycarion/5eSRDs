You summon a shroud to do your bidding. The creature appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The creature is friendly to you and your allies for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
