Thick, penumbral ichor drips from your shadow-stained mouth, filling your mouth with giant shadow fangs. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage as your shadowy fangs sink into it. If you have a bite attack (such as from a racial trait or a spell like alter self), you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage roll but not to your temporary hit points.

If you hit a humanoid target, you gain 1d4 temporary hit points until the start of your next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
