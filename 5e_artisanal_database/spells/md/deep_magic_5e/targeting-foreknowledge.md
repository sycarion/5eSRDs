Twisting the knife, slapping with the butt of the spear, slashing out again as you recover from a lunge, and countless other double-strike maneuvers are skillful ways to get more from your weapon. By casting this spell as a bonus action after making a successful melee weapon attack, you deal an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type to the target. In addition, if your weapon attack roll was a 19 or higher, it is a critical hit and increases the weapon’s damage dice as normal. The extra damage from this spell is not increased on a critical hit.
