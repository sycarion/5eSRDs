You clap your hands, setting off a chain of tiny events that culminate in throwing off an enemy’s aim. When an enemy makes a ranged attack with a weapon or a spell that hits one of your allies, this spell causes the enemy to reroll the attack roll unless the enemy makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The attack is resolved using the lower of the two rolls (effectively giving the enemy disadvantage on the attack).
