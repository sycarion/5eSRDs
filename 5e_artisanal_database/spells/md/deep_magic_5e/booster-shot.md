You imbue a two-handed ranged weapon (typically a shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, or heavy crossbow) that you touch with a random magical benefit. While the spell lasts, a projectile fired from the weapon has an effect that occurs on a hit in addition to its normal damage. Roll a d6 to determine the additional effect for each casting of this spell.

| D6 | EFFECT |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2d10 acid damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target |
| 2 | 2d10 lightning damage to the target and 1d10 lightning damage to all creatures in a 5-foot-wide line between the weapon and the target |
| 3 | 2d10 necrotic damage to the target, and the target has disadvantage on its first attack roll before the start of the weapon user’s next turn |
| 4 | 2d10 cold damage to the target and 1d10 cold damage to all other creatures in a 60-foot cone in front of the weapon |
| 5 | 2d10 force damage to the target, and the target is pushed 20 feet |
| 6 | 2d10 psychic damage to the target, and the target is stunned until the start of the weapon user’s next turn |

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, all damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
