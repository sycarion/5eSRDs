You speak a word of Void Speech. Choose a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and be deafened for 1 minute, except that it can still hear Void Speech. A creature deafened in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
