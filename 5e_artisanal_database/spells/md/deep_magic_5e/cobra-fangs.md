The spell causes the target to grow great, snake-like fangs. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell fails if the target already has a bite attack that deals poison damage.

If the target doesn’t have a bite attack, it gains one. The target is proficient with the bite, and it adds its Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is piercing and the damage die is a d4.

When the target hits a creature with its bite attack, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target’s bite counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
