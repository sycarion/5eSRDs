# Vine Trestle

- **Level**: 2 conjuration
- **Classes**: Druid, Ranger, Wizard
- **Casting Time**: 10 minutes
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a 1-inch piece of green vine that is consumed in the casting)
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates.

The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 Ã— your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.

***Ritual Focus.*** If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled.
