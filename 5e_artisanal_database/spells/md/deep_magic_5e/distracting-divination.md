Foresight tells you when and how to be just distracting enough to foil an enemy spellcaster. When an adjacent enemy tries to cast a spell, make a melee spell attack against that enemy. On a hit, the enemy’s spell fails and has no effect; the enemy’s action is used up but the spell slot isn’t expended.
