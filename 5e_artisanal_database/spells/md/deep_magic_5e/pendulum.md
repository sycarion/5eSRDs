You give the touched creature an aspect of regularity in its motions and fortunes. If the target gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, then for the duration of the spell it doesn’t make d20 rolls—to determine the results of attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws it instead follows the sequence 20, 1, 19, 2, 18, 3, 17, 4, and so on.
