A spectral version of a melee weapon of your choice materializes in your hand. It has standard statistics for a weapon of its kind, but it deals force damage instead of its normal damage type and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. You have proficiency with this weapon for the spell’s duration. The weapon can be wielded only by the caster; the spell ends if the weapon is held by a creature other than you or if you start your turn more than 10 feet from the weapon.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 force damage for each slot level above 2nd.
