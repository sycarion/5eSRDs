You transform yourself into a horrifying vision of death, rotted and crawling with maggots, exuding the stench of the grave. Each creature that can see you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to further castings of this spell for 24 hours.
