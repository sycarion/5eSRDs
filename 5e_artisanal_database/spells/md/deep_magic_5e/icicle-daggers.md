When you cast this spell, three icicles appear in your hand. Each icicle has the same properties as a dagger but deals an extra 1d4 cold damage on a hit.

The icicle daggers melt a few seconds after leaving your hand, making it impossible for other creatures to wield them. If the surrounding temperature is at or below freezing, the daggers last for 1 hour. They melt instantly if you take 10 or more fire damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can create two additional daggers for each slot level above 1st. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, daggers that leave your hand donâ€™t melt until the start of your next turn.
