# Blood Armor

- **Level**: 3 necromancy
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S (you must have just struck a foe with a melee weapon)
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Source**: Deep Magic 5e

When you strike a foe with a melee weapon attack, you can immediately cast **blood armor** as a bonus action. The foe you struck must contain blood; if the target doesn’t bleed, the spell ends without effect. The blood flowing from your foe magically increases in volume and forms a suit of armor around you, granting you an Armor Class of 18 + your Dexterity modifier for the spell’s duration. This armor has no Strength requirement, doesn’t hinder spellcasting, and doesn’t incur disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

If the creature you struck was a celestial, **blood armor** also grants you advantage on Charisma saving throws for the duration of the spell.
