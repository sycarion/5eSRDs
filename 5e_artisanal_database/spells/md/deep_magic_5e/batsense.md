For the duration of the spell, a creature you touch can produce and interpret squeaking sounds used for echolocation, giving it blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. The target cannot use its blindsight while deafened, and its blindsight doesn't penetrate areas of magical silence. While using blindsight, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on being silent. Additionally, the target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
