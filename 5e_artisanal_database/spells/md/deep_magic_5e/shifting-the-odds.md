By wrapping yourself in strands of chaotic energy, you gain advantage on the next attack roll or ability check that you make. Fate is a cruel mistress, however, and her scales must always be balanced. The second attack roll or ability check (whichever occurs first) that you make after casting **shifting the odds** is made with disadvantage.
