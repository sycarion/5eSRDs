You tweak a strand of a creature’s fate as it attempts an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. Roll a d20 and subtract 10 to produce a number from 10 to –9. Add that number to the creature’s roll. This adjustment can turn a failure into a success or vice versa, or it might not change the outcome at all.
