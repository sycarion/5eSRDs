You adjust the location of an ally to a better tactical position. You move one willing creature within range 5 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. The creature moves bodily through the intervening space (as opposed to teleporting), so there can be no physical obstacle (such as a wall or a door) in the path.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional willing creature for each slot level above 1st.
