With a snarled word of Void Speech, you create a swirling vortex of purple energy. Choose a point you can see within range. Creatures within 15 feet of the point take 10d6 necrotic damage, or half that damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. For each creature damaged by the spell, you can choose one other creature within range, including yourself, that is not a construct or undead. The secondary targets regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage you dealt.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the vortexâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
