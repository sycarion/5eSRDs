You can cast this spell as a reaction when youâ€™re targeted by a breath weapon. Doing so gives you advantage on your saving throw against the breath weapon. If your saving throw succeeds, you take no damage from the attack even if a successful save normally only halves the damage.

Whether your saving throw succeeded or failed, you absorb and store energy from the attack. On your next turn, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. If you opt not to make this attack, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage done by your attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
