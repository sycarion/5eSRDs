Your familiarity with the foul effects of death allows you to prevent a dead body from being returned to life using anything but the most powerful forms of magic.

You cast this spell by touching a creature that died within the last 24 hours. The body immediately decomposes to a state that prevents the body from being returned to life by the raise dead spell (though a resurrection spell still works). At the end of this spell’s duration, the body decomposes to a rancid slime, and it can’t be returned to life except through a true resurrection spell.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can affect one additional corpse for each slot level above 2nd.
