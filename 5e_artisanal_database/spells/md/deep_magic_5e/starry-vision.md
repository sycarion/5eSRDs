This spell acts as compelling fate, except as noted above (**starry** vision can be cast as a reaction, has twice the range of compelling fate, and lasts up to 1 minute). At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the bonus to AC increases by 1 for each slot level above 7th.
