You touch a tree and ask one question about anything that might have happened in its immediate vicinity (such as “Who passed by here?”). You get a mental sensation of the response, which lasts for the duration of the spell. Trees do not have a humanoid’s sense of time, so the tree might speak about something that happened last night or a hundred years ago. The sensation you receive might include sight, hearing, vibration, or smell, all from the tree’s perspective. Trees are particularly attentive to anything that might harm the forest and always report such activities when questioned.

If you cast this spell on a tree that contains a creature that can merge with trees, such as a dryad, you can freely communicate with the merged creature for the duration of the spell.
