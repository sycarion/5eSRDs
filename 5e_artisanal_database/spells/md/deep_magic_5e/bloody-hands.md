You cause the hands (or other appropriate body parts, such as claws or tentacles) of a creature within range to bleed profusely. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1 necrotic damage each round and suffer disadvantage on all melee and ranged attack rolls that require the use of its hands for the spellâ€™s duration.

Casting any spell that has somatic or material components while under the influence of this spell requires a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell is not cast but it is not lost; the casting can be attempted again in the next round.
