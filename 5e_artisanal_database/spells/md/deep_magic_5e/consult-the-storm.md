You ask a question of an entity connected to storms, such as an elemental, a deity, or a primal spirit, and the entity replies with destructive fury.

As part of the casting of the spell, you must speak a question consisting of fifteen words or fewer. Choose a point within range. A short, truthful answer to your question booms from that point. It can be heard clearly by any creature within 600 feet. Each creature within 15 feet of the point takes 7d6 thunder damage, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
