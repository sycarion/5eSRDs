You conjure a shadowy road between two points within range to create a bridge or path. This effect can bridge a chasm or create a smooth path through difficult terrain. The dark path is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet long. It can support up to 500 pounds of weight at one time. A creature that adds more weight than the path can support sinks through the path as if it didnâ€™t exist.
