Muttering Void Speech, you force images of terror and nonexistence upon your foes. Each creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature goes insane for the duration. While insane, a creature takes no actions other than to shriek, wail, gibber, and babble unintelligibly. The GM controls the creatureâ€™s movement, which is erratic.
