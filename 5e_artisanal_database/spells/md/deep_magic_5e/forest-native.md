While in a forest, you touch a willing creature and infuse it with the forestâ€™s energy, creating a bond between the creature and the environment. For the duration of the spell, as long as the creature remains within the forest, its movement is not hindered by difficult terrain composed of natural vegetation. In addition, the creature has advantage on saving throws against environmental effects such as excessive heat or cold or high altitude.
