This spell allows you to shred the life force of a creature you touch. You become invisible and make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target dies. Whether the attack hits or misses, you remain invisible until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d10 for each slot level above 7th.
