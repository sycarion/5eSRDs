The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell’s duration, your weapon takes on the form of a silver dragon’s head. Your attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage, and up to four other creatures of your choosing within 30 feet of the attack’s target must each make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra cold damage and the cold damage dealt to the secondary creatures increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
