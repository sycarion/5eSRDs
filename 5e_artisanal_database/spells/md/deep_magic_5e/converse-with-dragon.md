You gain limited telepathy, allowing you to communicate with any creature within 120 feet of you that has the dragon type, regardless of the creature’s languages. A dragon can choose to make a Charisma saving throw to prevent telepathic contact with itself.

This spell doesn’t change a dragon’s disposition toward you or your allies, it only opens a channel of communication. In some cases, unwanted telepathic contact can worsen the dragon’s attitude toward you.
