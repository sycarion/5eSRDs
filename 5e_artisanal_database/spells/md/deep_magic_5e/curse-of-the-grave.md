You tap your connection to death to curse a humanoid, making the grim pull of the grave stronger on that creatureâ€™s soul.

Choose one humanoid you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed. A remove curse spell or similar magic ends this curse. While cursed in this way, the target suffers the following effects:

* The target fails death saving throws on any roll but a 20.
* If the target dies while cursed, it rises 1 round later as a vampire spawn under your control and is no longer cursed.
* The target, as a vampire spawn, seeks you out in an attempt to serve its new master. You can have only one vampire spawn under your control at a time through this spell. If you create another, the existing one turns to dust. If you or your companions do anything harmful to the target, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it is no longer under your control.
