Dark entities herald your entry into combat, instilling an existential dread in your enemies. Designate a number of creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one) that you can see within range and that have an alignment different from yours. Each of those creatures takes 5d8 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you; a creature that makes a successful Wisdom saving throw takes half as much damage and is not frightened.

A creature frightened in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The creature makes this saving throw with disadvantage if you can see it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
