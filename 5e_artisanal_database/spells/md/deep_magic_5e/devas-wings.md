You touch a willing creature. The target grows feathery wings of pure white that grant it a flying speed of 60 feet and the ability to hover. When the target takes the Attack action, it can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the wings, with a reach of 10 feet. If the wing attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier and must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone. When the spell ends, the wings disappear, and the target falls if it was aloft.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional target for each slot level above 4th.
