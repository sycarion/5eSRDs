You create an invisible circle of protective energy centered on yourself with a radius of 10 feet. This field moves with you. The caster and all allies within the energy field are protected against dragonsâ€™ lair actions.
* Attack rolls resulting directly from lair actions are made with disadvantage.
* Saving throws resulting directly from lair actions are made with advantage, and damage done by these lair actions is halved.
* Lair actions occur on an initiative count 10 lower than normal.

The caster has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on this spell.
