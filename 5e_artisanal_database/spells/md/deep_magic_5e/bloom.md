- **Level**: 8 conjuration

You plant a silver acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of praises to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes extremely fertile, regardless of its previous state. Any seeds planted in the area grow at twice the natural rate. Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.

Choose one of the following effects, which appears and grows immediately:
* A field planted with vegetables of your choice, ready for harvest.
* A thick forest of stout trees and ample undergrowth.
* A grassland with wildflowers and fodder for grazing.
* An orchard of fruit trees of your choice, growing in orderly rows and ready for harvest.
Living creatures that take a short rest within the area of a bloom spell receive the maximum hit points for Hit Dice expended. **Bloom** counters the effects of a desolation spell.

***Ritual Focus.*** If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.
