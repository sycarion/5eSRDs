By making a scooping gesture, you cause the ground to slowly sink in an area 5 feet wide and 60 feet long, originating from a point within range. When the casting is finished, a 5-foot-deep trench is the result.

The spell works only on flat, open ground (not on stone or paved surfaces) that is not occupied by creatures or objects.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the width of the trench by 5 feet or the length by 30 feet for each slot level above 2nd. You can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 2nd.
