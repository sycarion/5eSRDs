When you **cast sculpt** snow in an area filled with snow, you can create one Large object, two Medium objects, or four smaller objects from snow. With a casting time of 1 action, your sculptings bear only a crude resemblance to generic creatures or objects. If you increase the casting time to 1 minute, your creations take on a more realistic appearance and can even vaguely resemble specific creatures; the resemblance isnâ€™t strong enough to fool anyone, but the creature can be recognized. The sculptures are as durable as a typical snowman.

Sculptures created by this spell can be animated with animate objects or comparable magic. Animated sculptures gain the AC, hit points, and other attributes provided by that spell. When they attack, they deal normal damage plus a similar amount of cold damage; an animated Medium sculpture, for example, deals 2d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 + 1 cold damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can sculpt one additional Large object for each slot level above 2nd. Two Large objects can be replaced with one Huge object.
