This spell pushes a creature you touch through a dimensional portal, causing it to disappear and then reappear a short distance away. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw, it disappears from its current location and reappears 30 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. This travel can take it through walls, creatures, or other solid surfaces, but the target can't reappear inside a solid object or not on solid ground; instead, it reappears in the nearest safe, unoccupied space along the path of travel.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the target is shoved an additional 30 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
