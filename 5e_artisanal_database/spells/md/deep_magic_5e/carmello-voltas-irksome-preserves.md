At your command, delicious fruit jam oozes from a small mechanical device (such as a crossbow trigger, a lock, or a clockwork toy), rendering the device inoperable until the spell ends and the device is cleaned with a damp cloth. Cleaning away the jam takes an action, but doing so has no effect until the spell ends. One serving of the jam can be collected in a suitable container. If it's eaten (as a bonus action) within 24 hours, the jam restores 1d4 hit points. The jam's flavor is determined by the material component.

The spell can affect constructs, with two limitations. First, the target creature negates the effect with a successful Dexterity saving throw. Second, unless the construct is Tiny, only one component (an eye, a knee, an elbow, and so forth) can be disabled. The affected construct has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks that depend on the disabled component until the spell ends and the jam is removed.
