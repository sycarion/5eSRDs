A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down from above. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foothigh Cylinder centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d6 Fire damage and 5d6 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Fire damage and the Radiant damage increase by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 5.
