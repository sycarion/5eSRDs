You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses the omen from the Omens table. Table: Omens | Omen | For Results That Will Be â€¦ | |--------------|----------------------------| | Weal | Good | | Woe | Bad | | Weal and woe | Good and bad | | Indifference | Neither good nor bad | The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results. If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
