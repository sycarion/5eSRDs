You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits Dim Light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the Invisible condition.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).
