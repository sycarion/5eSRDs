You summon an otherworldly being that appears as a loyal steed in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. This creature uses the Otherworldly Steed stat block. If you already have a steed from this spell, the steed is replaced by the new one. The steed resembles a Large, rideable animal of your choice, such as a horse, a camel, a dire wolf, or an elk. Whenever you cast the spell, choose the steed's creature typeâ€”Celestial, Fey, or Fiend which determines certain traits in the stat block.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
