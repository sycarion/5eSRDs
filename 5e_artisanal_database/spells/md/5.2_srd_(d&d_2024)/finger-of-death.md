You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a Zombie (see "Monsters") that follows your verbal orders.
