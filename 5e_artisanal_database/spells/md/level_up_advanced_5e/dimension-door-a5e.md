You teleport to any place you can see, visualize, or describe by stating distance and direction such as 200 feet straight downward or 400 feet upward at a 30-degree angle to the southeast.

You can bring along objects if their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller, provided it isn't carrying gear beyond its carrying capacity and is within 5 feet.

If you would arrive in an occupied space the spell fails, and you and any creature with you each take 4d6 force damage.
