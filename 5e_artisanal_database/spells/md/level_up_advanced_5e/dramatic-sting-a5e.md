You frighten the target by echoing its movements with ominous music and terrifying sound effects. It takes 1d4 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you until the spell ends.

At the end of each of the creature's turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 psychic damage.

You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.
