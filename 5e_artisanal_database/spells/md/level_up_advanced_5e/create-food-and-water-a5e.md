Your magic turns one serving of food or water into 3 Supply. The food is nourishing but bland, and the water is clean. After 24 hours uneaten food spoils and water affected or created by this spell goes bad.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You create an additional 2 Supply for each slot level above 3rd.
