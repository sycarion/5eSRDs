The target object's weight is greatly increased. Any creature holding the object must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop it. A creature which doesn't drop the object has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn as it figures out the object's new balance.

Creatures that attempt to push, drag, or lift the object must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC to do so.
