# Flaming Sphere

- **Level**: 2 Conjuration
- **Classes**: Druid, Wizard
- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Source**: Level Up Advanced 5e

A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears within range, lasting for the duration. It casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet, and ignites unattended flammable objects it touches.

You can use a bonus action to move the sphere up to 30 feet. It can jump over pits 10 feet wide or obstacles 5 feet tall. If you move the sphere into a creature, the sphere ends its movement for that turn and the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw against the sphere's damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
