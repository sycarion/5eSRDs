You reshape the target into any form you choose.

For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or chest, make a small passage through a wall (as long as it isn't more than 5 feet thick), seal a stone door shut, or create a hiding place. The target can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You may select one additional target for every slot level above 4th.
