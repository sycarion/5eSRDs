You create up to four hovering lights which appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that can be combined into a glowing Medium-sized humanoid form. Each sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

You can use a bonus action to move the lights up to 60 feet so long as each remains within 20 feet of another light created by this spell. A dancing light winks out when it exceeds the spell's range.
