Name or describe in detail a creature familiar to you. The spell reveals the general direction the creature is in (south, east, northwest, and so on) if it exists within range. This includes its current trajectory if it's travelling.

You may locate specific, known creatures, or the nearest creature of a specific type (like a bat, gnome, or red dragon) provided that you have observed that type within 30 feet at least once. If a specific creature you seek is in a different form (for example a wildshaped druid) the spell is unable to find it.

The spell cannot travel across running water 10 feet across or widerâ€”it is unable to find the creature and the trail ends.
