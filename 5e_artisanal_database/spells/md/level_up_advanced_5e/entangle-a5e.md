Constraining plants erupt from the ground in the spell's area, wrapping vines and tendrils around creatures. Until the spell ends, the area is difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell makes a Strength saving throw or it becomes restrained as the plants wrap around it. A creature restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

When the spell ends, the plants wither away.
