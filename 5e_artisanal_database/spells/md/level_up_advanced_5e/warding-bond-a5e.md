Until the spell ends, the target is warded by a mystic connection between it and you. While the target is within 60 feet it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Each time it takes damage, you take an equal amount of damage.

The spell ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if you use an action to dismiss it, or if the spell is cast again on either you or the target.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 2nd.
