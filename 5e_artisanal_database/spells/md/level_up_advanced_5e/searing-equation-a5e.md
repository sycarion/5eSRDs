You briefly go into a magical trance and whisper an alien equation which you never fully remember once the spell is complete. Each creature in the area takes 3d4 psychic damage and is deafened for 1 round.

Creatures who are unable to hear the equation, immune to psychic damage, or who have an Intelligence score lower than 4 are immune to this spell.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Creatures are deafened for 1 additional round for each slot level above 1st.
