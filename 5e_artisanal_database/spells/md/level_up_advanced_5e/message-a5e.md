You point and whisper your message at the target.

It alone hears the message and may reply in a whisper audible only to you.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and are certain it is beyond the barrier. The message is blocked by 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metals, or a thin sheet of lead.

The spell moves freely around corners or through openings.
