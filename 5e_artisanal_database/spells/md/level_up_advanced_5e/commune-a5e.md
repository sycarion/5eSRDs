You contact your deity, a divine proxy, or a personified source of divine power and ask up to 3 questions that could be answered with a yes or a no. You must complete your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question, unless the being does not know. When the being does not know, you receive "unclear" as an answer. The being does not try to deceive, and the Narrator may offer a short phrase as an answer if necessary.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a no answer increases.

The Narrator makes the following roll in secret: second casting —25%, third casting —50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.
