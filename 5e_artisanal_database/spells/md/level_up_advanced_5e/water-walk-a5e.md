Until the spell ends, the targets are able to move across any liquid surface (such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava) as if it was solid ground.

Creatures can still take damage from surfaces that would deliver damage from corrosion or extreme temperatures, but they do not sink while moving across it.

A target submerged in a liquid is moved to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.
