Magical energies surround the area and stop the type of designated creature from willingly entering by nonmagical means.

Designated creatures have disadvantage when attacking creatures within the area and are unable to charm, frighten, or possess creatures within the area. When a designated creature attempts to teleport or use interplanar travel to enter the area, it makes a Charisma saving throw or its attempt fails.

You may also choose to reverse this spell, trapping a creature of your chosen type within the area in order to protect targets outside it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell's duration increases by 1 hour for every slot level above 3rd.
