You silently clench your hand into a claw and invisible talons of pure will sprout from your fingers.

The talons do not interact with physical matter, but rip viciously at the psyche of any creature struck by them. For the duration, your unarmed strikes gain the finesse property and deal psychic damage. In addition, if your unarmed strike normally deals less than 1d4 damage, it instead deals 1d4 damage.
