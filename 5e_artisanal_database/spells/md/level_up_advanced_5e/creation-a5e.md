You weave raw magic into a mundane physical object no larger than a 5-foot cube. The object must be of a form and material you have seen before. Using the object as a material component for another spell causes that spell to fail.

The spell's duration is determined by the object's material. An object composed of multiple materials uses the shortest duration.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The size of the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.
