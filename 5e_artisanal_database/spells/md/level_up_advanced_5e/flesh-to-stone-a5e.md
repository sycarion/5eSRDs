The target becomes restrained as it begins to turn to stone. On a successful saving throw, the target is instead slowed until the end of its next turn and the spell ends.

A creature restrained by this spell makes a second saving throw at the end of its turn. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the target is petrified for the duration. If you maintain concentration for the maximum duration of the spell, this petrification is permanent.

Any pieces removed from a petrified creature are missing when the petrification ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Target one additional creature when you cast this spell with an 8th-level spell slot.
