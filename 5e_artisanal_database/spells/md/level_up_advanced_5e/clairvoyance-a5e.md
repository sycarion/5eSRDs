An invisible sensor is created within the spell's range. The sensor remains there for the duration, and it cannot be targeted or attacked.

Choose seeing or hearing when you cast the spell.

You may use that sense through the sensor as if you were there. As an action, you may switch which sense you are using through the sensor.

A creature able to see invisible things (from the see invisibility spell or truesight, for instance) sees a 4-inch diameter glowing, ethereal orb.
