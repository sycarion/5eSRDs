You create an illusory Large creature with an appearance determined by you that comes into being with all the necessary equipment needed to use it as a mount. This equipment vanishes when more than 10 feet away from the creature.

You or any creature you allow may ride the steed, which uses the statistics for a riding horse but has a Speed of 100 feet and travels at 10 miles per hour at a steady pace (13 miles per hour at a fast pace).

The steed vanishes if it takes damage (disappearing instantly) or you use an action to dismiss it (fading away, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount).
