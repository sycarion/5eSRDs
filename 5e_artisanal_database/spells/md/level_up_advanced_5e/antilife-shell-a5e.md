A barrier that glimmers with an oily rainbow hue pops into existence around you. The barrier moves with you and prevents creatures other than undead and constructs from passing or reaching through its surface.

The barrier does not prevent spells or attacks with ranged or reach weapons from passing through the barrier.

The spell ends if you move so that a Tiny or larger living creature is forced to pass through the barrier.
