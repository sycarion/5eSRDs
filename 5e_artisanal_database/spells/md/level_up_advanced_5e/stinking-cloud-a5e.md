You create a roiling, noxious cloud that hinders creatures and leaves them retching. The cloud spreads around corners and lingers in the air until the spell ends.

The area is heavily obscured. A creature in the area at the start of its turn makes a Constitution saving throw or uses its action to retch and reel.

Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on the save.

A moderate wind (10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds, a strong wind (20 miles per hour) after 1 round.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell's area increases by 5 feet for every 2 slot levels above 3rd.
