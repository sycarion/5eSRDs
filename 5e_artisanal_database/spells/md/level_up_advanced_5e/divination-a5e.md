Your offering and magic put you in contact with the higher power you serve or its representatives.

You ask a single question about something that will (or could) happen in the next 7 days. The Narrator offers a truthful reply, which may be cryptic or even nonverbal as appropriate to the being in question.

The reply does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome, such as making additional precautions.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases. The Narrator makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.
