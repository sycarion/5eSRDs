You create a floating, incandescent weapon with an appearance of your choosing and use it to attack your enemies. On the round you cast it, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon that deals force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and make another attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
