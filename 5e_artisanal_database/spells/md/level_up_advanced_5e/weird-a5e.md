You create illusions which manifest the deepest fears and worst nightmares in the minds of all creatures in the spell's area. Each creature in the area makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened until the spell ends. At the end of each of a frightened creature's turns, it makes a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
