You weave a veil over the natural terrain within the area, making it look, sound, or smell like another sort of terrain. A small lake could be made to look like a grassy glade. A path or trail could be made to look like an impassable swamp. A cliff face could even appear as a gentle slope or seem to extend further than it does. This spell does not affect any manufactured structures, equipment, or creatures.

Only the visual, auditory, and olfactory components of the terrain are changed. Any creature that enters or attempts to interact with the illusion feels the real terrain below. If given sufficient reason, a creature may make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. On a successful save, the creature sees the illusion superimposed over the actual terrain.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell targets an additional 50-foot cube for each slot level above 4th.
