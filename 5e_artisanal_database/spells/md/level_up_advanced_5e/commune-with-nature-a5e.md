Until the spell ends, your spirit bonds with that of nature and you learn about the surrounding land.

When cast outdoors the spell reaches 3 miles around you, and in natural underground settings it reaches only 300 feet. The spell fails if you are in a heavily constructed area, such as a dungeon or town.

You learn up to 3 facts of your choice about the surrounding area:

* Terrain and bodies of water
* Common flora, fauna, minerals, and peoples
* Any unnatural creatures in the area
* Weaknesses in planar boundaries
* Built structures
