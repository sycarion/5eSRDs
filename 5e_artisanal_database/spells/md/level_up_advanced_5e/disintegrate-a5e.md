A pale ray emanates from your pointed finger to the target as you attempt to undo it.

The target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points is obliterated, leaving behind nothing but fine dust, along with anything it was wearing or carrying (except magic items). Only true resurrection or a wish spell can restore it to life.

This spell automatically disintegrates nonmagical objects and creations of magical force that are Large-sized or smaller. Larger objects and creations of magical force have a 10-foot-cube portion disintegrated instead. Magic items are unaffected.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
