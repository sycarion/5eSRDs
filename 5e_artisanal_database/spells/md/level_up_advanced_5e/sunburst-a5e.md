Oozes and undead have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist this spell. You create a burst of radiant sunlight that fills the area. Each creature in the area takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded by this spell repeats its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a successful save.

This spell dispels any magical darkness in its area.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When using a 9th-level spell slot the damage increases by 2d6.
