You summon a creature from The Dreaming.

This creature uses the statistics of a fey creature (detailed below) with certain traits determined by your choice of its type: hag, hound, or redcap.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours.

It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only defends itself.

The summoned creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the summoned creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears at the end of the spell's maximum duration.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** For each slot level above 6th the fey creature's AC increases by 1, its hit points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra damage.
