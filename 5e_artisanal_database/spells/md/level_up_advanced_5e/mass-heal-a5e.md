Healing energy erupts from your steepled hands and restores up to 700 hit points between the targets.

Creatures healed in this way are also cured of any diseases, and any effect causing them to be blinded or deafened. In addition, on subsequent turns within the next minute you can use a bonus action to distribute any unused hit points.
