A metallic disc made of force, 3 feet in diameter and hovering 3 feet off the ground, appears within range. It can support up to 500 pounds. If it is overloaded, or if you move more than 100 feet away from it, the spell ends. You can end the spell as an action. While it is not carrying anything, you can use a bonus action to teleport the disk to an unoccupied space within range.

While you are within 20 feet of the disk, it is immobile. If you move more than 20 feet away, it tries to follow you, remaining 20 feet away. It can traverse stairs, slopes, and obstacles up to 3 feet high.

Additionally, you can ride the disc, spending your movement on your turn to move the disc up to 30 feet (following the movement rules above).

Moving the disk in this way is just as tiring as walking for the same amount of time.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you use a 3rd-level spell slot, either the spell's duration increases to 8 hours or the disk's diameter is 10 feet, it can support up to 2, 000 pounds, and it can traverse obstacles up to 10 feet high. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the disk's diameter is 20 feet, it can support up to 16, 000 pounds, and it can traverse obstacles up to 20 feet high.
