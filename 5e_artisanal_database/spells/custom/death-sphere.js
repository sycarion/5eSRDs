- **Level**: 3 Necromancy

- **Range**: 150 feet

A tiny screaming skull streaks from you to a point you choose within range and then bursts into a black shroud of clawing souls. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature killed by this blast returns as a Zombie.
