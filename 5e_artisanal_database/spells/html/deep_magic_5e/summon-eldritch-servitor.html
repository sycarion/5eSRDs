<h1>Summon Eldritch Servitor</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 5 conjuration</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 minute</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a vial of the caster’s blood and a silver dagger)</li>

</ul>
<p>You summon eldritch aberrations that appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:
* Two ghasts of Leng
* One shantak</p>
<p>When the summoned creatures appear, you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creatures are friendly to you and your allies. On a failure, the creatures are friendly to no one and attack the nearest creatures, pursuing and fighting for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Roll initiative for the summoned creatures, which take their own turns as a group. If friendly to you, they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you to issue a command), or they attack the nearest living creature if they are not commanded otherwise.</p>
<p>Each round when you maintain concentration on the spell, you must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn or take 1d4 psychic damage. If the total of this damage exceeds your Wisdom score, you gain 1 point of Void taint and you are afflicted with a form of short-term madness. The same penalty applies when the damage exceeds twice your Wisdom score, three times your Wisdom score, and so forth, if you maintain concentration for that long.</p>
<p>A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. If you stop concentrating on the spell before 1 hour has elapsed, the creatures become uncontrolled and hostile until they disappear 1d6 rounds later or until they are killed.</p>
