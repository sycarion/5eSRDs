<h1>Rolling Thunder</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 2 evocation</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (30-foot line)</li>

</ul>
<p>A tremendous bell note explodes from your outstretched hand and rolls forward in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. A creature made of material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on its saving throw against this spell.</p>
<p>While a creature is deafened in this way, it is wreathed in thundering energy; it takes 2d8 thunder damage at the start of its turn, and its speed is halved. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
