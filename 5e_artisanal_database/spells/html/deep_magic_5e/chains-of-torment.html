<h1>Chains of Torment</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 4 conjuration</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Warlock, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (an iron chain link dipped in blood)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You are surrounded by an aura of dim light in a 10-foot radius as you conjure an iron chain that extends out to a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). While grappled in this way, the creature is also restrained. A creature that’s restrained at the start of its turn takes 4d6 psychic damage. You can have only one creature restrained in this way at a time.</p>
<p>As an action, you can scan the mind of the creature that’s restrained by your chain. If the creature gets a failure on a Wisdom saving throw, you learn one discrete piece of information of your choosing known by the creature (such as a name, a password, or an important number). The effect is otherwise harmless.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
