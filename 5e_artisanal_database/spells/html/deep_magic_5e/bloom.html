<h1>Bloom</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 8 conjuration</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric, Druid, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 hour</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 1 mile</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a silver acorn worth 500 gp, which is consumed in the casting)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 year</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You plant a silver acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of praises to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes extremely fertile, regardless of its previous state. Any seeds planted in the area grow at twice the natural rate. Food harvested regrows within a week. After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.</p>
<p>Choose one of the following effects, which appears and grows immediately:
* A field planted with vegetables of your choice, ready for harvest.
* A thick forest of stout trees and ample undergrowth.
* A grassland with wildflowers and fodder for grazing.
* An orchard of fruit trees of your choice, growing in orderly rows and ready for harvest.
Living creatures that take a short rest within the area of a bloom spell receive the maximum hit points for Hit Dice expended. <strong>Bloom</strong> counters the effects of a desolation spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.</p>
