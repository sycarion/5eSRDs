<p>You select up to ten enemies you can see that are within range. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature is cursed to burst into flame if it reduces one of your allies to 0 hit points before this spell’s duration expires. The affected creature takes 6d8 fire damage and 6d8 radiant damage when it bursts into flame.</p>
<p>If the affected creature is wearing flammable material (or is made of flammable material, such as a plant creature), it catches on fire and continues burning; the creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the end of each of its turns until the creature or one of its allies within 5 feet of it uses an action to extinguish the fire.</p>
