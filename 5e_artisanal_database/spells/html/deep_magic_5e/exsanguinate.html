<p>You cause the body of a creature within range to become engorged with blood or ichor. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage each round, it is incapacitated, and it cannot speak, as it vomits up torrents of blood or ichor. In addition, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<p>At the end of each of its turns, a creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success—except for the reduction of its hit point maximum, which lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th.</p>
