<p>By drawing on the energy of the gods, you can temporarily assume the form of your patron’s avatar. Form of the gods transforms you into an entirely new shape and brings about the following changes (summarized below and in the avatar form stat block).
* Your size becomes Large, unless you were already at least that big.
* You gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and to one other damage type of your choice.
* You gain a Multiattack action option, allowing you to make two slam attacks and a bite.
* Your ability scores change to reflect your new form, as shown in the stat block.</p>
<p>You remain in this form until you stop concentrating on the spell or until you drop to 0 hit points, at which time you revert to your natural form.</p>
