<p>You create a sound on a point within range. The sound’s volume can range from a whisper to a scream, and it can be any sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p>
<p>Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the sound and can hear it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must take the Dash or Disengage action and move toward the sound by the safest available route on each of its turns. When it arrives to the source of the sound, the target must use its action to examine the sound. Once it has examined the sound, the target determines the sound is illusory and can no longer hear it, ending the spell’s effects on that target and preventing the target from being affected by the sound again for the duration of the spell. If a target takes damage from you or a creature friendly to you, it is no longer under the effects of this spell.</p>
<p>Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.</p>
