<h1>Unleash Effigy</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 9 transmutation</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: </li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You cause a stone statue that you can see within 60 feet of you to animate as your ally. The statue has the statistics of a stone golem. It takes a turn immediately after your turn. As a bonus action on your turn, you can order the golem to move and attack, provided you’re within 60 feet of it. Without orders from you, the statue does nothing.</p>
<p>Whenever the statue has 75 hit points or fewer at the start of your turn or it is more than 60 feet from you at the start of your turn, you must make a successful DC 16 spellcasting check or the statue goes berserk. On each of its turns, the berserk statue attacks you or one of your allies. If no creature is near enough to be attacked, the statue dashes toward the nearest one instead. Once the statue goes berserk, it remains berserk until it’s destroyed.</p>
<p>When the spell ends, the animated statue reverts to a normal, mundane statue.</p>
