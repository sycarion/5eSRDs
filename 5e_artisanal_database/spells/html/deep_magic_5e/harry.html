<p>You instill an irresistible sense of insecurity and terror in the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to avoid your notice and is frightened of you while you are within its line of sight. While you are within 1 mile of the target, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track the target, and the target can't take a long rest, terrified you are just around the corner. The target can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes, ending the spell on a success.
  On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell with a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours and the target can repeat the saving throw once each hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours, and the target can repeat the saving throw every 8 hours.</p>
