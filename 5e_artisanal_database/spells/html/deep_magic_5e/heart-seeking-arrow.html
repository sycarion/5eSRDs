<p>The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition—or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon—seeks its target's vital organs. Make the attack roll as normal. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra 6d6 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon, or half as much damage on a miss as it streaks unerringly toward its target. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target has disadvantage on its next death saving throw, and, if it dies, it can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the extra damage on a hit increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
