<p>When you cast <strong>doom of disenchantment</strong>, your armor and shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.</p>
<p>The spell also suppresses other magical properties of the attack. A sword of wounding, for example, can’t cause ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost to the weapon's damage normally. If the attack was a spell, it’s affected as if you had cast counterspell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.</p>
