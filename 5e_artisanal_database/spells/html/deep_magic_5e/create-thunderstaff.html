<h1>Create Thunderstaff</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 7 transmutation</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: </li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 10 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a quarterstaff)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>After you cast <strong>create thunderstaff</strong> on a normal quarterstaff, the staff must then be mounted in a noisy location, such as a busy marketplace, and left there for 60 days. During that time, the staff gradually absorbs ambient sound.</p>
<p>After 60 days, the staff is fully charged and can’t absorb any more sound. At that point, it becomes a <strong>thunderstaff</strong>, a +1 quarterstaff that has 10 charges. When you hit on a melee attack with the staff and expend 1 charge, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage. You can cast a thunderwave spell from the staff as a bonus action by expending 2 charges. The staff cannot be recharged.</p>
<p>If the final charge is not expended within 60 days, the staff becomes nonmagical again.</p>
