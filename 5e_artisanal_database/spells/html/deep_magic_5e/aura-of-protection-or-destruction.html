<p>When you cast this spell, you radiate an otherworldly energy that warps the fate of all creatures within 30 feet of you. Decide whether to call upon either a celestial or a fiend for aid. Choosing a celestial charges a 30-foot-radius around you with an aura of nonviolence; until the start of your next turn, every attack roll made by or against a creature inside the aura is treated as a natural 1. Choosing a fiend charges the area with an aura of violence; until the start of your next turn, every attack roll made by or against a creature inside the aura, including you, is treated as a natural 20.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can extend the duration by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
