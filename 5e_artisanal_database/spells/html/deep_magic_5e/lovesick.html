<p>This spell causes creatures to behave unpredictably, as they randomly experience the full gamut of emotions of someone who has fallen head over heels in love. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.</p>
<p>An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p>

<tr>
<td>1-3</td>
<td>The creature spends its turn moping like a lovelorn teenager; it doesn’t move or take actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4–5</td>
<td>The creature bursts into tears, takes the Dash action, and uses all its movement to run off in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>The creature uses its action to remove one item of clothing or piece of armor. Each round spent removing pieces of armor reduces its AC by 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7–8</td>
<td>The creature drops anything it is holding in its hands and passionately embraces a randomly determined creature. Treat this as a grapple attempt which uses the Attack action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>The creature flies into a jealous rage and uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>The creature can act and move normally.</td>

<p>At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.</p>
