<h1>Icy Manipulation</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 6 transmutation</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a piece of ice preserved from the plane of elemental ice)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>One creature you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified (frozen solid). A petrified creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself if it makes two successful saves. If a petrified creature gets two failures on the saving throw (not counting the original failure that caused the petrification), the petrification becomes permenant.</p>
<p>The petrification also becomes permanent if you maintain concentration on this spell for a full minute. A permanently petrified/frozen creature can be restored to normal with greater restoration or comparable magic, or by casting this spell on the creature again and maintaining concentration for a full minute.</p>
<p>If the frozen creature is damaged or broken before it recovers from being petrified, the injury carries over to its normal state.</p>
