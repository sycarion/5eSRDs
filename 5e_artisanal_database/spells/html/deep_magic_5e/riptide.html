<p>With a sweeping gesture, you cause water to swell up into a 20-foot tall, 20-foot radius cylinder centered on a point on the ground that you can see. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and suspended in the cylinder; on a successful save, the creature moves to just outside the nearest edge of the cylinder.</p>
<p>At the start of your next turn, you can direct the current of the swell as it dissipates. Choose one of the following options.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Riptide.</em></strong> The water in the cylinder flows in a direction you choose, sweeping along each creature in the cylinder. An affected creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 40 feet in the chosen direction, landing prone.</li>
<li><strong><em>Undertow.</em></strong> The water rushes downward, pulling each creature in the cylinder into an unoccupied space at the center. Each creature is knocked prone and must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
