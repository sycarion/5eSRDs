<p>When you cast <strong>mass hobble mount</strong>, you make separate ranged spell attacks against up to six horses, wolves, or other four-legged or two-legged beasts being ridden as mounts within 60 feet of you. The targets can be different types of beasts and can have different numbers of legs. Each beast hit by your spell is disabled so that it can’t move at its normal speed without incurring injury. An affected creature that moves more than half its base speed in a turn takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p>This spell has no effect on a creature that your GM deems to not be a mount.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
