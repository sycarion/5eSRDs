<h1>Ally Aegis</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 6 abjuration</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 reaction, which you take when your ally is hit by an attack or is targeted by a spell that deals damage other than psychic damage</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>When you see an ally within range in imminent danger, you can use your reaction to protect that creature with a shield of magical force. Until the start of your next turn, your ally has a +5 bonus to AC and is immune to force damage. In addition, if your ally must make a saving throw against an enemy’s spell that deals damage, the ally takes half as much damage on a failed saving throw and no damage on a successful save. Ally aegis offers no protection, however, against psychic damage from any source.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional ally for each slot level above 6th.</p>
