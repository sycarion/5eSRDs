<h1>Blood Lure</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 2 enchantment</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 action</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 10 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a container or pool of blood)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You point at any location (a jar, a bowl, even a puddle) within range that contains at least a pint of blood. Each creature that feeds on blood and is within 60 feet of that location must make a Charisma saving throw. (This includes undead, such as vampires.) A creature that has Keen Smell or any similar scent-boosting ability has disadvantage on the saving throw, while undead have advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is attracted to the blood and must move toward it unless impeded.</p>
<p>Once an affected creature reaches the blood, it tries to consume it, foregoing all other actions while the blood is present. A successful attack against an affected creature ends the effect, as does the consumption of the blood, which requires an action by an affected creature.</p>
