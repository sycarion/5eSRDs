<p>Upon casting this spell, you delay the next potion you consume from taking effect for up to 1 hour. You must consume the potion within 1 round of casting <strong>delay potion</strong>; otherwise the spell has no effect. At any point during <strong>delay potion’s</strong> duration, you can use a bonus action to cause the potion to go into effect. When the potion is activated, it works as if you had just drunk it. While the potion is delayed, it has no effect at all and you can consume and benefit from other potions normally.</p>
<p>You can delay only one potion at a time. If you try to delay the effect of a second potion, the spell fails, the first potion has no effect, and the second potion has its normal effect when you drink it.</p>
