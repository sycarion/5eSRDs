<h1>Desolation</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 8 necromancy</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric, Druid, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 hour</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (an obsidian acorn worth 500 gp, which is consumed in the casting)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 year</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon plants, such as entangle, require an ability check using the caster’s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by <strong>desolation</strong>.</p>
<p>After one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.</p>
<p>A living creature that finishes a short rest within the area of a <strong>desolation</strong> spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. Desolation counters the effects of a bloom spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.</p>
