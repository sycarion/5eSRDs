<h1>Vine Trestle</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: 2 conjuration</li>
<li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Ranger, Wizard</li>
<li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 10 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</li>
<li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a 1-inch piece of green vine that is consumed in the casting)</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong>: Deep Magic 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates.</p>
<p>The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 × your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ritual Focus.</em></strong> If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled.</p>
