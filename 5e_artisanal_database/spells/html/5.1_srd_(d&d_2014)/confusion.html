<p>This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.</p>
<p>An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.</p>
