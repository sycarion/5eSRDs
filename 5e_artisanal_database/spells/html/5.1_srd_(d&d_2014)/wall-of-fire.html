When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet o f that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side o f the wall deals no damage. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p>
