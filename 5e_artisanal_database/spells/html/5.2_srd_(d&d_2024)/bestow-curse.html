<p>You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice: - Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability. - The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. - In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn. - If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5–6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7–8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.</p>
