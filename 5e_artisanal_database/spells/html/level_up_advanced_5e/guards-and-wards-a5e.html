<p>You create wards that protect the target area. Each warded area has a maximum height of 20 feet and can be shaped. Several stories of a stronghold can be warded by dividing the area among them if you can walk from one to the next while the spell is being cast.</p>
<p>When cast, you can create a password that can make a creature immune to these effects when it is spoken aloud. You may also specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose.</p>
<p><em>Guards and wards</em> creates the following effects within the area of the spell.</p>

<li><strong><em>Corridors:</em></strong> Corridors are heavily obscured with fog. Additionally, creatures that choose between multiple passages or branches have a 50% chance to unknowingly choose a path other than the one they meant to choose.</li>
<li><strong><em>Doors:</em></strong> Doors are magically locked as if by an <em>arcane lock</em> spell. Additionally, you may conceal up to 10 doors with an illusion as per the illusory object component of the <em>minor illusion</em> spell to make the doors appear as unadorned wall sections.&lt;/ li&gt;</li>
<li><strong><em>Stairs:</em></strong> Stairs are filled from top to bottom with webs as per the <em>web</em> spell. Until the spell ends, the webbing strands regrow 10 minutes after they are damaged or destroyed.</li>
</ul>
