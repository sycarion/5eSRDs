<p>You employ sheer force of will to make reality question the existence of a nearby creature, causing them to warp visibly in front of you.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, a target native to your current plane is banished to a harmless demiplane and incapacitated. At the end of the duration the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space). A target native to a different plane is instead banished to its native plane.</p>
<p>At the end of each of its turns, a banished creature can repeat the saving throw with a -1 penalty for each round it has spent banished, returning on a success. If the spell ends before its maximum duration, the target reappears in the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space) but otherwise a target native to a different plane doesn't return.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> The duration of banishment increases by 1 round for each slot level above 4th.</p>
