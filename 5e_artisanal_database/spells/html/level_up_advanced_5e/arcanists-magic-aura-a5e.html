<p>You craft an illusion to deceive others about the target's true magical properties.</p>
<p>Choose one or both of the following effects. When cast upon the same target with the same effect for 30 successive days, it lasts until it is dispelled.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>False Aura:</strong> A magical target appears nonmagical, a nonmagical target appears magical, or you change a target's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic of your choosing. Additionally, you can choose to make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.</li>
<li><strong>Masking Effect:</strong> Choose a creature type. Spells and magical effects that detect creature types (such as a herald's Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell) treat the target as if it were a creature of that type. Additionally, you can choose to mask the target's alignment trait (if it has one).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When cast using a 6th-level spell slot or higher the effects last until dispelled with a bonus action.</p>
