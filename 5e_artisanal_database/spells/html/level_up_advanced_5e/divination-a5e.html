<p>Your offering and magic put you in contact with the higher power you serve or its representatives.</p>
<p>You ask a single question about something that will (or could) happen in the next 7 days. The Narrator offers a truthful reply, which may be cryptic or even nonverbal as appropriate to the being in question.</p>
<p>The reply does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome, such as making additional precautions.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases. The Narrator makes the following roll in secret: second casting—25%, third casting—50%, fourth casting—75%, fifth casting—100%.</p>
