<p>You only require line of sight to the target (not line of effect). On its next turn the target follows a one-word command of your choosing. The spell fails if the target is undead, if it does not understand your command, or if the command is immediately harmful to it.</p>
<p>Below are example commands, but at the Narrator's discretion you may give any one-word command.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approach/Come/Here:</strong> The target uses its action to take the Dash action and move toward you by the shortest route, ending its turn if it reaches within 5 feet of you.</li>
<li><strong>Bow/Grovel/Kneel:</strong> The target falls prone and ends its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Drop:</strong> The target drops anything it is holding and ends its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Flee/Run:</strong> The target uses its action to Dash and moves away from you as far as it can.</li>
<li><strong>Halt:</strong> The target remains where it is and takes no actions. A flying creature that cannot hover moves the minimum distance needed to remain aloft.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> For each slot level above 1st, you affect one additional target that is within 30 feet of other targets.</p>
