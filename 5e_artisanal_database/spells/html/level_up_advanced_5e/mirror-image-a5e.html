<p>A total of 3 illusory copies of yourself appear in your space. For the duration, these copies move with you and mimic your actions, creating confusion as to which is real.</p>
<p>You can use an action to dismiss them.</p>
<p>Each time you're targeted by a creature's attack, roll a d20 to see if it targets you or one of your copies.</p>
<p>With 3 copies, a roll of 6 or higher means a copy is targeted. With two copies, a roll of 8 or higher targets a copy, and with 1 copy a roll of 11 or higher targets the copy.</p>
<p>A copy's AC is 10 + your Dexterity modifier, and when it is hit by an attack a copy is destroyed.</p>
<p>It may be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.</p>
<p>All other damage and effects have no impact.</p>
<p>Attacking creatures that have truesight, cannot see, have blindsight, or rely on other nonvisual senses are unaffected by this spell.</p>
