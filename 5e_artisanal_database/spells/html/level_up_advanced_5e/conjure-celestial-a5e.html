<p>You summon a creature from the realms celestial.</p>
<p>This creature uses the statistics of a celestial creature (detailed below) with certain traits determined by your choice of its type: an angel of battle, angel of protection, or angel of vengeance.</p>
<p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours.</p>
<p>It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the creature only defends itself.</p>
<p>The creature disappears when reduced to 0 hit points. If your concentration is broken before the spell ends, you lose control of the celestial creature, which becomes hostile and might attack you and your companions. An uncontrolled creature disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> For each slot level above 7th the celestial creature's AC increases by 1, its hit points increase by 10, and when it deals damage with an attack it deals 1d4 extra damage.</p>
