<p>On the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can attempt to sense the presence of poisons, poisonous creatures, and disease by making a Perception check. On a success you identify the type of each poison or disease within range. Typically noticing and identifying a poison or disease is a DC 10 check, but the Narrator may use DC 15 for uncommon afflictions, DC 20 for rare afflictions, or DC 25 for afflictions that are truly unique. On a failed check, this casting of the spell cannot sense that specific poison or disease.</p>
<p>The spell penetrates most barriers but is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead.</p>
