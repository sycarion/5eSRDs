<p>The target has advantage on its saving throw if you are in combat with it. The target becomes charmed and incapacitated, though it can still hear you. Until the spell ends, any memories of an event that took place within the last 24 hours and lasted 10 minutes or less may be altered.</p>
<p>You may destroy the memory, have the target recall the event with perfect clarity, change the details, or create a new memory entirely with the same restrictions in time frame and length.</p>
<p>You must speak to the target in a language you both know to modify its memories and describe how the memory is changed. The target fills in the gaps in details based on your description.</p>
<p>The spell automatically ends if the target takes any damage or if it is targeted by another spell. If the spell ends before you have finished modifying its memories, the alteration fails. Otherwise, the alteration is complete when the spell ends and only greater restoration or remove curse can restore the memory.</p>
<p>The Narrator may deem a modified memory too illogical or nonsensical to affect a creature, in which case the modified memory is simply dismissed by the target. In addition, a modified memory doesn't specifically change the behavior of a creature, especially if the memory conflicts with the creature's personality, beliefs, or innate tendencies.</p>
<p>There may also be events that are practically unforgettable and after being modified can be remembered correctly when another creature succeeds on a Persuasion check to stir the target's memories. This check is made with disadvantage if the creature does not have indisputable proof on hand that is relevant to the altered memory.</p>
<p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> When using a 6th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 7 days ago. When using a 7th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 30 days ago. When using an 8th-level spell slot, the event can be from as far as 1 year ago. When using a 9th-level spell slot, any event can be altered.</p>
