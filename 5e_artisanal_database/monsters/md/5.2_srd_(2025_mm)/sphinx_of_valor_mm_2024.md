## Traits

***Inscrutable.*** No magic can observe the sphinx remotely or detect its thoughts without its permission. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain its intentions or sincerity are made with Disadvantage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).*** If the sphinx fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sphinx makes two Claw attacks and uses Roar.

***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +12, reach 5 ft. 20 (4d6 + 6) Slashing damage.

***Roar (3/Day).*** The sphinx emits a magical roar. Whenever it roars, the roar has a different effect, as detailed below (the sequence resets when it takes a Long Rest):

- **Second Roar**: *Wisdom Saving Throw*: DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot Emanation originating from the sphinx. *Failure:*  The target has the Paralyzed condition, and it repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
- **Third Roar**: *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot Emanation originating from the sphinx. *Failure:*  44 (8d10) Thunder damage, and the target has the Prone condition. *Success:*  Half damage only.
