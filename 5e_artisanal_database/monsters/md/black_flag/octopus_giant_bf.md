### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** While out of water, the octopus can hold its breath for 1 hour.
- **Underwater Camouflage:** The octopus's Stealth is 18 while underwater.
- **Water Breathing:** The octopus can breathe only underwater.

### Actions

- **Tentacles:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13), if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The octopus can grapple up to two creatures at one time.

### Bonus Actions

- **Tentacle Slam:** The octopus slams a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling into a solid surface. The target must make a DC 13 STR save, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Ink Dash (Recharge 4-6):** When a creature the octopus can see deals damage to it, the octopus can release a 20-foot- radius cloud of ink all around itself, if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured until the end of the octopus's next turn, although a significant current can disperse the ink. Then, the octopus can swim up to its swimming speed. If it does so, it immediately releases any creatures it is grappling.
