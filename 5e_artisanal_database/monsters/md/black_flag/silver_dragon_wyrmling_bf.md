- **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 CON save, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Paralyzing Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
