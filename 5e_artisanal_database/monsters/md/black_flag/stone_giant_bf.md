### Reactions

- **Missile Deflection:** If a creature the giant can see makes a ranged weapon attack against the giant, the giant can add 3 to its AC. If the attack misses, the giant can catch the missile, provided the attack included a projectile, and throw it back at the attacker, using the giant's normal ranged weapon attack bonus and the weapon's normal damage.
