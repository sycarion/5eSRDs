- **Shield Bash:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (2d4+4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Spear:** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6+4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Bonus Actions

- **Entertaining Display:** The gladiator slams its spear against its shield, twirls its spear, or roars while flexing, entertaining or intimidating up to two creatures it can see within 15 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 CHA save or be charmed or frightened (the gladiator's choice) until the end of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Parry:** The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
