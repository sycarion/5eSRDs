### Special Abilities

- **Fungal Toxicity:** A creature that hits the mycolid with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the poison isn't neutralized before 1 hour has passed, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 CON save, taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Mycolid Connection:** The mycolid can pinpoint the location of each friendly mycolid within 120 feet of it. In addition, its telepathy range increases to 120 feet when communicating with other mycolids.
- **Plant Resilience:** The mycolid is resistant to exhaustion and to the paralyzed, petrified, and unconscious conditions.

### Actions

- **Gardening Pick:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.
- **Slowing Spores (Recharge 5-6):** The mycolid ejects slowing spores from its body. Each creature that isn't a mycolid within 5 feet of the mycolid must make a DC 13 WIS save. On a failure, a creature takes 5 (2d4) poison damage and is slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't slowed. A slowed creature's speed is halved, and it can't take reactions.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fetid Feast:** The mycolid draws sustenance from a Medium or larger pile of carrion or rotting vegetation within 5 feet of it. It regains 5 (2d4) HP. The mycolid can't use Fetid Feast on a pile of carrion or vegetation if it or another mycolid has already used Fetid Feast on that pile.
