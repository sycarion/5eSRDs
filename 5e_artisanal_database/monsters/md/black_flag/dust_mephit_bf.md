### Special Abilities

- **Death Burst:** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of dust. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **False Appearance:** While the mephit remains motionless and hovering, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloud of dust.

### Actions

- **Claws:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) slashing damage, and the target loses 2 (1d4) HP at the start of its next turn, as sand and grit irritate the wound.
- **Dust Blast:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) bludgeoning damage, and the target loses 2 (1d4) HP at the start of its next turn, as sand and grit irritate the wound.
- **Blinding Breath (Recharge 6):** The mephit exhales blinding dust in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 DEX save. On a failure, a creature takes 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Sandman's Call (1/Day):** The mephit casts the sleep spell (spell save DC 11), requiring no material components and using WIS as the spellcasting ability.
