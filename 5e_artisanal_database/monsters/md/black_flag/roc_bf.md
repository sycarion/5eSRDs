### Special Abilities

- **Heightened Sight:** The roc's Perception is 19 when perceiving by sight.
- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The roc is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Seabird:** The roc can swim up to 60 feet on its turn, but it must start and end its movement either flying or on a solid surface, such as a ship or beach. If it is swimming at the end of its turn, it must succeed on a DC 19 CON save or it immediately begins to sink and suffocate. A suffocating roc must succeed on a DC 19 STR check to fly out of the substance where it is sinking.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The roc makes one Beak attack and two Talon attacks. If both Talon attacks hit one Huge or Gargantuan creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the roc can't use its Talons on another target.
- **Beak:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 27 (4d8+9) piercing damage.
- **Talon:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 23 (4d6+9) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the roc can't use its Talons on another target.

### Bonus Actions

- **Territorial Shriek:** The roc shrieks a territorial challenge at up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 17 CHA save or be frightened until the end of its next turn. While frightened by this shriek, a creature must take the Dash action on its turn and move away from the roc by the safest available route, unless there is nowhere to move.
