If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 HP, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining HP, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

- **Assailing Pheromone:** When the wasp takes damage, it can release a scent perceptible only to other wasps. Each wasp within 10 feet of this wasp has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
