### Special Abilities

- **Heated Body:** A creature that touches the salamander or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Heated Weapons:** When the salamander hits with a metal melee weapon, the weapon deals an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The salamander makes one Trident attack and one Tail attack, or it makes three Fire Bolt attacks. It can replace one Trident attack with a Tail attack.
- **Trident:** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) piercing damage, or 12 (2d8+3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is wielding a weapon or shield, it must succeed on a DC 14 DEX save or drop the weapon or shield (the salamander's choice if the target is wielding both).
- **Tail:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, the salamander can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the salamander can't make tail attacks against other targets.
- **Fire Bolt:** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, ranged 60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (3d6+2) fire damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Tighten Grip:** The salamander tightens its grip around one creature it is grappling. Until the start of the salamander's next turn, the target has disadvantage on any check made to escape the grapple, and other than a successful check to escape the grapple, the target can't be moved, knocked prone, or otherwise removed from the salamander's grasp without the salamander's permission.
