### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the shrieker remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary fungus.
- **Plant Resilience:** The shrieker is resistant to exhaustion and to the paralyzed, petrified, and unconscious conditions.

### Actions

- **Thunderous Burst:** The shrieker emits a concentrated burst of sound at one creature it can sense within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 DEX save, taking 2 (1d4) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shriek:** The shrieker emits a high-pitched shriek audible within 300 feet of it. Each creature within 30 feet of it that isn't a Plant and that can hear the shriek must succeed on a DC 10 WIS save or be frightened until the shriek ends. The shrieker must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue shrieking. It can stop shrieking at any time. The shriek ends if the shrieker is incapacitated.<br>A frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the frightened effect of this shrieker's Shriek for the next 24 hours.

### Reactions

- **Startled Shriek:** When bright light or a creature other than a Plant moves to within 30 feet of the shrieker, the shrieker can use Shriek, if it isn't already shrieking.
