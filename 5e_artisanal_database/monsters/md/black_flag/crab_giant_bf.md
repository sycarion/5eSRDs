- **Amphibious:** The crab can breathe air and water.

### Actions

- **Pincer:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). The crab has two pincers, each of which can grapple only one target.

### Bonus Actions

- **Pincer Pinch:** One breathing creature grappled by the crab must succeed on a DC 12 STR save or be unable to speak or cast spells with verbal components and begin suffocating, as the crab squeezes the air from the target's lungs. This effect lasts until the grapple ends.
