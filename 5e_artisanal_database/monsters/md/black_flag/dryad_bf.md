### Special Abilities

- **Fey Resilience:** The dryad is resistant to the charmed and unconscious conditions.
- **Magic Resistance:** The dryad has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **One with the Forest:** While in a forest, the dryad can't be surprised, and it leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
- **Speak with Beasts and Plants:** The dryad can communicate with Beasts and Plants as if they shared a language.
- **Tree Stride:** Once on its turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of its movement to step magically into one living tree within its reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or larger.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dryad makes two Vine Whip or Blast of Pollen attacks. If both Vine Whip attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be restrained by vines until the end of its next turn.
- **Vine Whip:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8+2) slashing damage.
- **Blast of Pollen:** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6+4) poison damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Charming Scent:** The dryad emits an alluring, floral scent toward one Beast or Humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 WIS save or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, the target views the dryad as an ally and views the dryad's requests favorably, though it isn't under the dryad's control. The charmed creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The dryad can have up to two creatures charmed in this way at a time.
- **Forest's Aid (21 HP or Fewer, 1/Day):** The dryad magically calls a horde of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and other small animals native to the forest. The horde uses the statistics of 1 swarm of rats. The called creatures arrive on initiative count 20 of the next round, acting as allies of the dryad and obeying its spoken commands. They remain for 1 hour, until the dryad dies, or until the dryad dismisses them as a bonus action.
