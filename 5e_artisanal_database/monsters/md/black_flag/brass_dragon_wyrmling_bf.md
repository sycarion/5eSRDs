### Special Abilities

- **Pounce:** If the dragon moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the dragon can make one Claw attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11 DEX save, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Sleep Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.
