While bonded with the target's shadow, the shadow can use this bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature, provided the creature is within 120 feet of the shadow.
- **Shadow Stealth:** The shadow takes the Hide action. It can use this bonus action only while in dim light or darkness.
