### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The death dog is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Multiple Heads:** The death dog has two heads and is resistant to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and unconscious conditions.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The death dog makes two Bite attacks.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (2d4+2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 CON save or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target is poisoned. Every 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must repeat the save, reducing its HP maximum by 5 (2d4) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its HP maximum to 0.

### Bonus Actions

- **Dual Bark:** The death dog's two heads bark at creatures in two 15-foot cones. Each creature in the area of a cone must succeed on a DC 12 CON save or be deafened until the end of its next turn. If the cones overlap each other, each creature in overlapping cones must make only one save with disadvantage rather than one save for each cone.
