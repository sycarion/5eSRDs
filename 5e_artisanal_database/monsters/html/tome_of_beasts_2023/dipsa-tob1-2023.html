<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amorphous:</strong> The dipsa can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</li>
<li><strong>Discreet Bite:</strong> The bite of a dipsa is barely perceptible and the wound is quickly anesthetized. When the dipsa hits with a Bite attack, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the dipsa and its attack. Each time the creature takes acid damage from an attached dipsa, it can repeat this check, noticing the dipsa on a success. A creature that takes acid damage from the dipsa while below half its hp maximum automatically succeeds on this check.</li>
<li><strong>Ooze Nature:</strong> The dipsa doesn't require sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Swamp Camouflage:</strong> The dipsa has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the dipsa attaches to the target. While attached, the dipsa can't attack, and at the start of each of the dipsa's turns, the target takes 3 (1d6) acid damage and must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have its hp maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translucent:</strong> The dipsa takes the Hide action.</li>
