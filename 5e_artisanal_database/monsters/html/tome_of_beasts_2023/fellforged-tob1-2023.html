<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Construct Nature:</strong> The fellforged doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Inhabiting Spirit:</strong> The fellforged is inhabited and animated by a specter. If the fellforged fails a saving throw against an effect that turns undead, the specter is expelled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fellforged with the hp total it had before it was expelled. The specter otherwise uses the statistics of a specter.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the fellforged has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The fellforged makes two Necrotic Slam attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Necrotic Slam:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burst Gears:</strong> The specter within the fellforged strains the construct's body, sending broken springs and gears flying. Each creature within 5 feet of the fellforged must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each time the fellforged uses this bonus action, its speed is reduced by 5 feet, and it can't use this bonus action if its speed is 0. Its speed returns to normal when it finishes a long rest.</li>
