<li><strong>Swarm:</strong> The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.</li>
<li><strong>Weight of Wings:</strong> A creature that starts its turn in the swarm's space has its speed halved and must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded. Both effects end when the creature ends its turn outside the swarm's space. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the blinding effect of Weight of Wings for the next 24 hours.</li>

On a failure, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.</li>
