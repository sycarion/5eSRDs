<ul>
<li><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Draconic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bibliophile:</strong> The paper drake understands any written language it can see, provided it is touching the surface on which the words are written.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance (Book Form Only):</strong> While the drake remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary book.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The drake makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack, or it makes two Book Flap attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite (Dragon Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Book Flap (Book Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the drake can fly up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, as it flaps its pages.</li>
<li><strong>Claw (Dragon Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Shredded Breath (Dragon Form Only; Recharge 5-6):</strong> The drake exhales sharp shreds of paper in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (4d4) slashing damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fold:</strong> The paper drake can fold and reshape its papery body to change its size between Tiny, Small, and Medium. It can also use this bonus action to fold itself into the shape of a book, which doesn't have wings, or back into its Small form. Without wings, it loses its flying speed. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. It reverts to its Small form if it dies.</li>
