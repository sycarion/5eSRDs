</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Construct Nature:</strong> The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Enchanted Weapons:</strong> The golem's weapon attacks are magical. When the golem hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 5d8 force damage (included in the attack).</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Form:</strong> The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Vessel:</strong> When the smaragdine golem counters or ends a spell with Absorb Spell, it holds the spell's magical energy within its body and becomes Charged for 1 minute. While Charged, the golem sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The smaragdine golem makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Release Spell.</li>
<li><strong>Slam:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8) force damage.</li>
<li><strong>Release Spell (Recharge Special):</strong> The smaragdine golem releases an absorbed spell's energy in a green burst centered on a point the golem can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature, other than the smaragdine golem, within 5 feet of that point per level of the absorbed spell must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage per level of the absorbed spell and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated. The golem can use this action only if it is Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absorb Spell:</strong> When a creature the smaragdine golem can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the golem can absorb the spell's energy, countering it. This works like the counterspell spell, except the golem must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell's level. Alternatively, when a creature the golem can see within 30 feet of the golem starts its turn while under the effects of a spell, such as bless or heroes' feast, the golem can absorb the spell's magic, ending the effect. In either case, the golem's ability check for this is +10. If it successfully counters or ends the spell, it becomes Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait). The golem can't use Absorb Spell while it is Charged.</li>
