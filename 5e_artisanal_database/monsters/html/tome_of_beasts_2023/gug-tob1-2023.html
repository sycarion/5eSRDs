<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Towering Strength:</strong> The gug is considered to be a Gargantuan giant for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The gug makes two four Grasping Claw attacks, or it makes two Grasping Claw attacks and two Stomp attacks. It can replace one Grasping Claw attack with a use of Fling or Swallow.</li>
<li><strong>Grasping Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The gug has four Grasping Claws, each of which can grapple only one target.</li>
<li><strong>Stomp:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft. Hit: 20 (2d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Fling:</strong> One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the gug is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Swallow:</strong> The gug makes one Grasping Claw attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the gug, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gug's turns. A gug can have only one creature swallowed at a time.</li>
