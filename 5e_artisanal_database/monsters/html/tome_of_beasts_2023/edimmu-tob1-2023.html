<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporeal Movement:</strong> The edimmu can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
<li><strong>Rejuvenation:</strong> If destroyed, an edimmu rises again in 2d4 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. When the edimmu rises, it appears within 5 feet of its remains. Only burying its mortal remains in consecrated or hallowed ground prevents this trait from functioning.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> The edimmu doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Water Siphon:</strong> The edimmu has advantage on attack rolls against creatures made of or gaining power from magical water, such as water elementals, water jinnborn, water genies, and sorcerers with water-based origins. In addition, such creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw against the edimmu's Draining Touch and Multiattack.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The edimmu makes two Draining Touch attacks. If both attacks hit one creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Draining Touch:</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after drinking 1 pint of water. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.</li>
