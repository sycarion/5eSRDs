<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Construct Nature:</strong> The possessed pillar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Fists:</strong> The possessed pillar's weapon attacks are magical. When the pillar hits with a Slam attack, the Slam deals an extra 2d8 necrotic damage or radiant damage (included in the attack), the pillar's choice.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance:</strong> While the pillar remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a statue or a carved column.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Form:</strong> The pillar is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The pillar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Magnetic Body:</strong> The eldritch magic powering the possessed pillar causes the pillar's body to produce a minor magnetic field. When a creature hits the pillar with a weapon made of metal, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the weapon sticks to the pillar. If the creature can't or won't let go of the weapon, it is also stuck to the pillar and restrained. A stuck weapon can't be used. A creature can take its action to remove one metal object from the pillar by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The pillar can release one creature or metal object stuck to it as a bonus action. If the pillar dies, all creatures and metal objects stuck to it are released.</li>
</ul>
