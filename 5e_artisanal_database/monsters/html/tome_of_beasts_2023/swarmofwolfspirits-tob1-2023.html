<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporeal Movement:</strong> The swarm of wolf spirits can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
<li><strong>Swarm:</strong> The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> The swarm of wolf spirits doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The swarm of wolf spirits makes two Spectral Bites attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Spectral Bites:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) cold damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage, or 7 (2d6) cold damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer.</li>
<li><strong>Chilling Howl (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The swarm of wolf spirits howls, causing cold fear to course through those that hear it. Each creature within 15 feet that can hear the howl must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) cold damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more also suffers one level of exhaustion. A frightened creature can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
