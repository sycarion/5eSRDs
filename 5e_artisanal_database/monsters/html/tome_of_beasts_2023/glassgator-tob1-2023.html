<ul>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Perception +2, Stealth +4</li>
<li><strong>Senses:</strong> blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 12</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The glass gator can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Constricting Lunge:</strong> If the glass gator jumps at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the gator can make one Constrict attack against it as a bonus action.</li>
<li><strong>Standing Leap:</strong> The glass gator's long jump is up to 15 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent:</strong> The glass gator has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide while underwater or in dim light.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Constrict:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, and the glass gator can't use Constrict on another target.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silt Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):</strong> When it takes damage while underwater and within 5 feet of the bottom of a body of water, the glass gator stirs up a 10-foot-radius sphere of silt centered on it. The silt spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong current disperses it. The glass gator can then swim up to half its speed. The cloud of silt doesn't move with the glass gator.</li>
