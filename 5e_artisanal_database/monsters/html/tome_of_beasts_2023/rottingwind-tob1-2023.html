<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Air Form:</strong> The rotting wind can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</li>
<li><strong>Invisibility:</strong> The rotting wind is invisible.</li>
<li><strong>Poisonous Aura:</strong> The rotting wind radiates an aura of poison and decay that slowly pollutes the area within 30 feet of it. Each hour the rotting wind stays in a place, nonmagical plants in the aura begin to wither, and water in the aura becomes poisoned. Nonmagical plants in the aura for 24 hours die. A creature that drinks water poisoned by the aura must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the tomb rot disease (see the Tomb Rot trait). Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease.</li>
<li><strong>Tomb Rot:</strong> A creature infested with this disease manifests symptoms 1d4 days after infection, which include muscle weakness and rotten-smelling breath as its body rots from the inside out. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and suffer one level of exhaustion. This exhaustion lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> The rotting wind doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The rotting wind makes two Wind of Decay attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the tomb rot disease (see the Tomb Rot trait).</li>
<li><strong>Wind of Decay:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the rotting wind's space. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.</li>
