<li><strong>Sweet Song (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The wampus cat sings a sweet melody. Each creature within 60 feet of her that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wampus cat's Sweet Song for the next 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Terrifying Yowl (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The wampus cat emits an ear-piercing yowl. Each creature within 15 feet of the wampus cat that can hear the yowl must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened.</li>
