<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Devil's Sight:</strong> Magical darkness doesn't impede the spawn's darkvision.</li>
<li><strong>Hive Bond:</strong> While the spawn is within 60 feet of at least one member of its hive, it has advantage on initiative rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks. The spawn can't be surprised if at least one other member is aware of the danger and within 300 feet of it.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The spawn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Speak with Insects:</strong> The spawn can communicate with insects as if they shared a language.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The spawn of Arbeyach makes one Bite attack and one Stinger attack.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage.</li>
<li><strong>Stinger:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Children of Arbeyach (1/Day):</strong> The spawn of Arbeyach magically calls 1d4 swarms of insects. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the spawn and obeying its spoken commands. The insects remain for 1 hour, until the spawn dies, or until the spawn dismisses them as a bonus action.</li>
