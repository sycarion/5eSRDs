<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> The risen reaver doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The risen reaver makes three Bladed Fist attacks.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infused Arsenal:</strong> When the risen reaver is hit with a nonmagical melee weapon or when it starts its turn in the same space as a nonmagical melee weapon that isn't being worn or carried, it absorbs the weapon into its body. If the weapon is being wielded by an attacker, the attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or lose its weapon. For 1 minute, the reaver has resistance to the type of damage dealt by that weapon, and when it hits with its Bladed Fist, the fist deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage of the type dealt by the weapon. The reaver can absorb no more than three weapons in this way every 24 hours.</li>
