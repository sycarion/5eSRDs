<h3>Actions</h3>

<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the sloth doesn't have another creature grappled.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Sloth's Embrace:</strong> The giant sloth crushes a creature it is grappling by pulling the creature against its fetid, furry chest. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the save is also stunned until the end of its next turn.</li>
