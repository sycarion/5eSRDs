<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Empty Keg:</strong> A keg golem holds 20 gallons of ale. If it runs out of ale or empties itself from ale blast, the golem's speed is reduced to 0 and it has disadvantage on all attack rolls until it is refilled with at least 1 gallon of ale.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Form:</strong> The keg golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The keg golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling Charge:</strong> If the keg golem moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the keg golem can make one slam attack against it as a bonus action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slam:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Ale Blast (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The keg golem shoots a 1 gallon jet of ale in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
