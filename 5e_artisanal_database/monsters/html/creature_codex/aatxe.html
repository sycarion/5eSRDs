<li><strong>Know Thoughts:</strong> The aatxe can use an action to read the surface thoughts of one creature within 30 feet. This works like the detect thoughts spell, except it can only read surface thoughts and there is no limit to the duration. It can end this effect as a bonus action or by using an action to change the target. Limited Speech (Humanoid Form Only). The aatxe can verbally communicate only simple ideas and phrases, though it can understand and follow a conversation without issue.</li>
