<h3>Special Abilities</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The anzu makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its talons.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Talons:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The anzu uses one of the following breath weapons: <br><em> Fire Breath. The anzu exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. <br></em> Water Breath. The anzu exhales a wave of water in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 38 (11d6) bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 30 feet away from the anzu and knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Relocation:</strong> The anzu teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When it does, it briefly transforms into a bolt of lightning, flashes upwards, then crashes down unharmed at its destination. Each creature within 5 feet of the anzu's starting location or destination must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature within 5 feet of both locations makes this saving throw only once.</li>
