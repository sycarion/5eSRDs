<ul>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> perception +4, stealth +8</li>
<li><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keen Hearing and Smell:</strong> The sasquatch has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</li>
<li><strong>Plant Camouflage:</strong> The sasquatch has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.</li>
<li><strong>Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):</strong> If the sasquatch takes 25 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead.</li>
<li><strong>Reckless:</strong> At the start of its turn, the sasquatch can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The sasquatch makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its fists.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Fist:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Rock:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Vanishing Tantrum (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The sasquatch roars and stomps, kicking up debris and leaving deep footprints in the ground. Each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The sasquatch can then move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and take the Hide action as a bonus action.</li>
