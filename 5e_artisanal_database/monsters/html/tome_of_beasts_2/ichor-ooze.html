<h3>Special Abilities</h3>

<li><strong>Amorphous:</strong> The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The ooze has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Sense Destroyer:</strong> The ichor ooze knows the direction and distance to the creature that performed the killing blow on the fiend that created the ooze, as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pseudopod:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12).</li>
<li><strong>Hurl Mote:</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 10/30 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) fire damage.</li>
<li><strong>Life Drain:</strong> One creature grappled by the ooze must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken, and the ooze regains hp equal to that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.</li>
