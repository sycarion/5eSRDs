<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nauseous Gas:</strong> The kezai produces a faint, nauseating gas. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the kezai must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) poison damage. The area within 20 feet of the kezai is lightly obscured by the thin gas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The kezai makes three attacks: one with its poison barb and two with its claws.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Poison Barb:</strong> Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 3 (1d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.</li>
<li><strong>Searing Acid (Recharge 6):</strong> The kezai's mandibles drip a searing acid, instantly igniting the gas around it. Each creature within 20 feet of the kezai must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The kezai's Nauseous Gas trait becomes inactive for 1 minute. The kezai can't use Searing Gas unless Nauseous Gas has been active for at least 1 minute.</li>
