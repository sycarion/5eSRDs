<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>At will: druidcraft
3/day each: entangle, goodberry
1/day each: barkskin, pass without trace, shillelagh
- <strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- <strong>Speak with Beasts and Plants:</strong> The dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.
- <strong>Tree Stride:</strong> Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 ft. of her movement to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 ft. of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the second tree. Both trees must be large or bigger.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Club:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.</li>
<li><strong>Fey Charm:</strong> The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.<br>Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours.<br>The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.</li>
