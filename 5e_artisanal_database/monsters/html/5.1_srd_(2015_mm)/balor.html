<h3>Special Abilities</h3>

The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Aura:</strong> At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.</li>

<li><strong>Magic Weapons:</strong> The balor's weapon attacks are magical.</li>
