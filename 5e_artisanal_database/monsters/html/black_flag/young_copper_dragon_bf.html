<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrosive Scales:</strong> When the copper dragon hasn't spit its Acid Breath, the acid built up within the dragon causes the patina on its scales to spread to weapons that strike it. While the dragon's Acid Breath is available, any weapon made of metal that hits the dragon corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If a nonmagical weapon's penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the dragon is destroyed after dealing damage. A magical weapon can't have a penalty greater than -5, and a magical weapon removes this penalty after 24 hours or after its attuned wielder finishes a long rest.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Slowing Breath, if available.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d10+4) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 DEX save, taking 40 (9d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Slowing Breath (Recharge 6):</strong> As the <strong>copper dragon wyrmling</strong>, except it is a 30-foot cone, and the save DC is 14.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Shape:</strong> The dragon magically transforms into a Beast or Humanoid that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Dragon. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</li>
