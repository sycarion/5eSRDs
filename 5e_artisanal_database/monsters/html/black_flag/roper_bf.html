<ul>
<li><strong>Damage Vulnerabilities:</strong> thunder</li>
<li><strong>Damage Resistances:</strong> Monstrosity Resilience</li>
<li><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 60 ft.</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> -</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climbing Tendrils:</strong> If at least four of the roper's Grasping Tendrils aren't grappling creatures, the roper has a climbing speed of 30 feet.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance:</strong> While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal conical or spire-like cave formation, such as a stalagmite or stalactite.</li>
<li><strong>Grasping Tendrils:</strong> The roper can have up to six Grasping Tendrils at a time. Each Grasping Tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 HP; vulnerable to thunder damage; immune to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a Grasping Tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A Grasping Tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 STR check against it.</li>
<li><strong>Monstrosity Resilience:</strong> The roper is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The roper makes one Bite attack and three Grasping Tendril attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d8+4) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Grasping Tendril:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d4+4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on STR checks and STR saves, and the roper can't use the same Grasping Tendril on another target. A creature immune to the poisoned condition doesn't have disadvantage on STR checks and STR saves from the tendril.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reel:</strong> The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snapping Tendril:</strong> When a Grasping Tendril that is grappling a creature is destroyed, the roper can quickly pull the remains of that tendril back to it with a whipping snap. Each creature within 10 feet of the roper must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or be knocked prone.</li>
