<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demonic Resilience:</strong> The golmana is resistant to cold, fire, and lightning damage. In addition, it is immune to poison damage and to the poisoned condition.</li>
<li><strong>Heightened Hearing:</strong> The golmana's Perception is 19 when perceiving by hearing.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The golmana has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The golmana can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The golmana makes two Claws attacks and one Tail attack. If both Claws attacks hit a Medium or smaller creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the golmana can't make Claws attacks against other targets.</li>
<li><strong>Claws:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (3d8+4) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tail:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Void Screech (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The golmana lets out a keening screech in a 30-foot cone. Each creature that isn't a Fiend in that area must make a DC 15 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and 18 (4d8) thunder damage, and it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of the golmana's next turn, as brief contact with the energies of the Void destabilizes the creature. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't suffer this disadvantage on its next attack roll.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consuming Rend:</strong> The golmana violently digs its small, torso claws into one creature it is grappling. The target must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The golmana then regains HP equal to the damage dealt.</li>
