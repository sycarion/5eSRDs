<li><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> cold</li>
<li><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 120 ft., keensense 60 ft.</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Common,Draconic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ice Walk:</strong> The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. In addition, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> If the dragon fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead.</li>
<li><strong>Numbing Chill:</strong> When the white dragon hasn't unleashed its Cold Breath, the cold builds up within it and ripples outward from it. While the dragon's Cold Breath is available, it emits a numbing chill, and each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 CON save or its speed is halved.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (2d10+8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d6+8) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tail:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d8+8) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Frightful Presence:</strong> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 WIS save or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 CON save, taking 63 (14d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect:</strong> The dragon automatically detects every creature and trap within 30 feet of it, pinpointing the current location of each.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack:</strong> The dragon makes a Tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Roar (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dragon roars at up to two creatures of its choice within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 17 CHA save or be vulnerable to cold damage until the end of its next turn. A target resistant to cold damage isn't resistant to it for the duration. A target immune to cold damage is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 DEX save or take 15 (2d6+8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
