<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aura of the Devil Lord:</strong> Each hostile creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the pit fiend must succeed on a DC 21 WIS save or be frightened until the start of its next turn. Each friendly devil within 20 feet of the pit fiend is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions and has advantage on the first attack roll it makes on each of its turns.</li>
<li><strong>Devilish Resilience:</strong> The devil is resistant to cold damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, it is immune to fire damage and poison damage and to the poisoned condition.</li>
<li><strong>Flaming Weapons:</strong> The pit fiend's weapon attacks are magical. When the fiend hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d6 fire damage (included in the attack).</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The pit fiend has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The pit fiend makes one Bite attack, one Gore attack, one Mace attack, and one Tail attack, or it makes four Hurl Flame attacks. If two Hurl Flame attacks hit one creature, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a DC 21 DEX save as the fire bursts outward from the target, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>

The target must succeed on a DC 21 CON save or be poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain HP. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
