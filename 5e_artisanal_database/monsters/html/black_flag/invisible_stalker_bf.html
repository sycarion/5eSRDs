<li><strong>Faultless Tracker:</strong> At the end of each long rest, the invisible stalker can choose a creature it knows or has seen to be its quarry. A stalker summoned by another creature can choose only the quarry specified by its summoner, but the stalker also knows the location of its summoner while it continues to serve the summoner. The stalker always knows the direction and distance to its quarry, provided the two are on the same plane of existence.</li>
