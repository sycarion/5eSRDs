<li><strong>Golden Splendor:</strong> When the gold dragon hasn't unleashed its Fire Breath, its scales gleam and sparkle like molten gold or a pile of gold coins.

</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>

<li><strong>Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 DEX save, taking 66 (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Weakening Breath (Recharge 6):</strong> As the <strong>gold dragon wyrmling</strong>, except it is a 30-foot cone, and the save DC is 17.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Shape:</strong> The dragon magically transforms into a Beast or Humanoid that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Dragon. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</li>
