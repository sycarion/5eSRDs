<li><strong>Life Drain:</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6+3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or its HP maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0.<br>A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.

<li><strong>Command Horde:</strong> The wight commands up to five friendly skeletons or zombies to do one of the following:<br>- <strong>Protect.</strong> Until the start of the wight's next turn, each time a friendly creature within 5 feet of a target is attacked, the target can use its reaction to intercept the attack, becoming the target instead.<br>- <strong>Overwhelm.</strong> Until the start of the wight's next turn, each target has advantage on attack rolls against a creature on its turn if at least one other target is within 5 feet of the creature and the allied target isn't incapacitated.<br>- <strong>Shamble.</strong> Each target uses its reaction to move up to its speed in a direction chosen by the wight. If this movement provokes an opportunity attack, that attack is made with disadvantage.</li>
