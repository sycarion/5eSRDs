<li><strong>Disciplined Fighter:</strong> At the start of each of its turns, the erinyes chooses one of the following fighting styles to adopt, which lasts until the start of the erinyes's next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Aggressive.</strong> The erinyes has advantage on the first attack it makes on its turn, but the next attack roll against the erinyes has advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Retributive.</strong> The next time the erinyes is hit by a melee weapon attack from a creature within 5 feet of it, the erinyes can make one Longsword attack against the attacker (no action required).</li>
<li><strong>Defensive.</strong> The next time erinyes uses the Parry reaction, it takes only half the damage if the attack hits and regains 18 (4d8) HP if the attack doesn't hit.</li>
<li><strong>Poisonous Weapons:</strong> The erinyes's weapon attacks are magical. When the erinyes hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 poison damage (included in the attack).</li>
