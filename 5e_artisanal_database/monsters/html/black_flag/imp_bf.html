<li><strong>Change Shape:</strong> The imp magically transforms into a Medium or smaller Beast that has a CR no higher than its own or back into its true form, which is a Fiend. Without wings, it loses its flying speed. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</li>
