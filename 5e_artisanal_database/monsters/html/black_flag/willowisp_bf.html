<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ephemeral:</strong> The will-o'-wisp can't wear or carry anything. In addition, it adds its WIS modifier to its AC (included above).</li>
<li><strong>Incorporeal Movement:</strong> The will-o'-wisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
<li><strong>Variable Illumination:</strong> The will-o'-wisp sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp can alter the radius as a bonus action.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> The will-o'-wisp doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Resilience:</strong> The will-o'-wisp is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The will-o'-wisp makes two Shock attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Shock:</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6+3) lightning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Invisibility:</strong> The will-o'-wisp and its light magically become invisible until it attacks or uses its Beckon, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beckon:</strong> The will-o'-wisp pulses its lightly gently toward one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or use its reaction to move up to its speed toward the will-o'-wisp by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks or damaging terrain when moving.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consume Life:</strong> When a creature the will-o'-wisp can see within 15 feet of it is reduced to 0 HP, the will-o'-wisp can consume some of that creature's fading life. The will-o'-wisp gains 7 (2d6) temporary HP, and the creature has disadvantage on the next death save it makes before the end of the wisp's next turn.</li>
