<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The night hag can use Cause Sorrow. It then makes two Claw or Arcane Bolt attacks. It can replace one Claw or Arcane Bolt attack with a use of Spellcasting.</li>
<li><strong>Claw (Hag Form Only):</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (4d6+4) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Arcane Bolt:</strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (3d10+3) force damage.</li>
<li><strong>Cause Sorrow:</strong> One creature the hag can see within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 CHA save or be filled with sorrow for 1 minute. While filled with sorrow, a creature is incapacitated and experiences visions or memories of sorrowful events. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns (if conscious) or end of each hour (if unconscious), ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>For each hour an unconscious creature is affected, its HP maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic. The creature dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0. If an unconscious creature suffers from least 1 hour, it doesn't gain any benefits from the rest. The hag can have only one creature filled with sorrow at a time. If it uses Cause Sorrow on another, the effect on the previous creature ends.Cause Sorrow for at</li>

<li><strong>Etherealness:</strong> The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. The hag can use Cause Sorrow on an unconscious creature not on its plane; otherwise, the hag can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.</li>
