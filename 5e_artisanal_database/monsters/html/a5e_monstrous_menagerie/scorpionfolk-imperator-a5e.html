<li><strong>Burning Gust of Wind (2nd-Level: V, S, M):</strong> A hot blast of wind erupts from the imperators claw in a line 10 feet wide and 60 feet long. It extinguishes small fires and disperses vapors. For 1 minute or until the imperators concentration is broken  each creature that starts its turn in the area or moves into the area must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet directly away and take 7 (2d6) fire damage. A creature in the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every foot moved towards the imperator. The imperator can change the direction of the gust with a bonus action.</li>
<li><strong>Venomous Fireball (3rd-Level; V, S, M):</strong> Green fire streaks from the imperator to a point within 120 feet and explodes in a 20-foot radius  spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also poisoned until the end of its next turn.</li>
