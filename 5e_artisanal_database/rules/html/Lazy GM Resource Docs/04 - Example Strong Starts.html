<h1>04 - Example Strong Starts</h1>
<p>A strong start kicks your game off in the middle of the action. It helps the players to let go of the real world and fall into the story unfolding at the table. Depending on where your adventure takes place, you can use any of the following strong starts in your own game, whether running a single-session adventure or a longer campaign.</p>
<h2>Cities and Towns</h2>
<p>In a settlement, a strong start can make use of either combat or roleplaying.</p>
<ol>
<li>The characters interrupt bandits breaking into a shop.</li>
<li>Something slithers out of a nearby sewer.</li>
<li>A noble lord bumps into one of the characters and threatens to have them arrested.</li>
<li>A group of cultists kindly ask for a sample of a character's blood.</li>
<li>A hooded patron visits the characters, asking the characters to kill them in two days.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Wilderness</h2>
<p>Wilderness locations can involve either action or mystery in a strong start.</p>
<ol>

<li>A rampaging werebear storms through the area, mistaking the characters for the hunters who killed their mate.</li>
<li>Night falls, revealing an alien starscape above.</li>
<li>The characters see a tall humanoid with antlers stalking from the shadows, carrying a large scythe in one hand and three humanoid heads in the other.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Dungeons, Caves, and Caverns</h2>
<p>Subterranean adventures lend themselves to the widest possible range of strong starts.</p>
<ol>
<li>A vampire appears from a sudden rise of mist, introduces herself, and asks the characters for a favor.</li>
<li>An ancient statue turns its head toward the characters and whispers a valuable secret.</li>
