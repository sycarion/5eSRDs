<h1>Combat Maneuvers</h1>
<h1>Combat Traditions</h1>
<p>Combat traditions are the basic disciplines of fighting that a warrior relies upon: Adamant Mountain, Biting Zephyr, Mirror’s Glint, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current, Razor’s Edge, Sanguine Knot, Spirited Steed, Tempered Iron, Tooth and Claw, and Unending Wheel.</p>
<h1>Maneuvers in Combat</h1>
<p>Adventurers can do much more than just hit an opponent or dodge a blow, instead delivering special attacks that debilitate or turn a foe’s missed assault into a painful mistake. Many of these techniques are combat maneuvers, sublime methods and tactics that make every combatant and their approach to fighting unique.<br />
You know a number of combat maneuvers determined by your class and class level. Your known combat maneuvers are chosen from the combat traditions you are proficient with. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower.<br />
Using a combat maneuver requires spending one or more exertion points and either a bonus action, reaction, or action. Certain combat maneuvers require two or more attacks (from Extra Attacks or the use of other class features), and if you are unable to use the Attack action to make as many attacks on your turn as the combat maneuver requires, you cannot use that combat maneuver.<br />
A maneuver sometimes forces a target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Maneuver DC</strong> \= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier</p>
<p>Combat maneuvers are nonmagical.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In order to learn a combat maneuver, you must know its combat tradition and meet any prerequisites. New combat maneuvers learned through a feat or by taking levels in an additional class may be up to the highest degree of combat maneuvers you are able to learn.</p>
<h2>Stances</h2>
<p>Activating a combat stance requires a bonus action. Once activated, a combat stance remains active until you are knocked unconscious, stunned, activate a different combat stance, begin a long rest, or choose to end it on your turn.</p>
<h1>Exertion Pool</h1>
<p>To use a combat maneuver, you must expend exertion points. You have a maximum number of exertion points equal to double your proficiency bonus. You regain any spent exertion points at the end of a short or long rest.<br />
Alternatively, you can meditate, refocus, and stretch to refill your exertion pool more quickly. You expend Hit Dice to do so, recovering 1d4 exertion points for each Hit Die expended. The process takes 1 minute per expended Hit Die.</p>
<h1>Basic Maneuvers</h1>
<p>Several basic maneuvers are presented below. The Narrator can use these to help adjudicate other improvised actions, following a similar structure and using similarly weighted effects.<br />
All creatures can use basic maneuvers, even if they do not have access to combat maneuvers. No exertion points are required to use a basic maneuver. Unless otherwise noted, using a basic maneuver replaces an attack made on your turn.<br />
<strong>Basic Melee Damage</strong>. When you successfully use a basic maneuver you also deal basic melee damage. This is equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. Basic melee damage is bludgeoning damage, but at the Narrator’s discretion may be piercing or slashing damage.<br />
You cannot use a basic maneuver to activate any features that deal additional damage (such as Sneak Attack or Divine Smite) unless the feature specifically states otherwise.<br />
Any creature with a Challenge Rating of 0 cannot deal basic melee damage.</p>
<h2>Disarm</h2>
<p>You can use the Disarm maneuver to attempt to knock an item or weapon from a creature’s hand. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.<br />
The target must be within your reach and be holding an item (either carried or wielded). The target makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and the target drops the item in its space. The target has advantage if it is larger than you or holding the item with two or more hands, and a target smaller than you has disadvantage.</p>
<h2>Grab On</h2>
<p>While you cannot grapple a creature two or more size categories larger than you, you can grab onto it. By jumping onto its back or climbing up a limb, you can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against the creature’s maneuver DC to cling to or balance upon its body. On a success, you move into the creature’s space and can move upon its body as if it is difficult terrain.<br />
While grabbing onto a larger creature, you gain advantage on attack rolls against it. The larger creature may be able to attack you as normal, depending on its limbs or attacks. It can also use an action or replace one of its attacks on its turn to try to dislodge you, for instance shaking you loose or bashing you against a wall, forcing you to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against its maneuver DC or fall prone into the nearest space adjacent to the creature, taking its basic melee damage in the process.<br />
If the creature chooses to roll over in order to dislodge you, it becomes prone, but you have disadvantage on the saving throw to hang on.</p>
<h2>Grapple</h2>
<p>You can use the Grapple maneuver to grab or wrestle a creature. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.<br />
You must have at least one free hand to attempt a grapple, your target must be within your reach, and the target must be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and the target becomes grappled (see Conditions). In addition to other circumstances that end the condition, you can release the target at any time (no action required).<br />
<strong><em>Escaping a Grapple</em></strong>. While grappled, a creature can use its action to attempt to escape. It must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC.<br />
<strong><em>Moving a Grappled Creature</em></strong>. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you. When you do so, your Speed is halved, unless the creature’s weight is within your carrying capacity and you are not encumbered by bulky items.<br />
<strong><em>Freeing a Grappled Creature.</em></strong> You can use the Grapple maneuver to try to free another grappled or restrained creature. The creature grappling or restraining the target makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. If it fails the saving throw, the grappled or restrained creature is freed. Additionally, you may move the freed creature 5 feet in any direction.</p>
<h2>Knockdown</h2>
<p>You can use the Knockdown maneuver to trip or push a creature down. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.<br />
The target must be within your reach and be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and knock the target prone.</p>
<h2>Overrun</h2>
<p>You can use an action or bonus action to make an Overrun maneuver to move through a hostile creature’s space by forcing your way past. Make a Strength saving throw against the target’s maneuver DC. On a success, you deal basic melee damage and can move through the hostile creature’s space once this turn. The creature can choose to just let you pass instead of rolling. You have advantage if you are larger than the target, or disadvantage if you are smaller. If you are two or more sizes smaller than the target, you can move through the hostile creature’s space without making a save. You still provoke opportunity attacks if you move beyond a creature’s reach.</p>
<h2>Shove</h2>
<p>You can use the Shove maneuver to push a creature away. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this maneuver replaces one of them.<br />
The target must be within your reach and be no more than one size category larger than you. The target makes a Strength saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, you deal basic melee damage and push the target a number of feet away from you up to 5 + 5 for every 5 points it failed its saving throw by. You can move the creature in any direction away from you (to the side, forward, or diagonally away).<br />
A creature that is shoved off of a precipice is propelled off of whatever it is standing on—it does not receive any saving throw or ability check to grab onto something to avoid falling down below.</p>

<h2>Adamant Mountain Maneuvers</h2>
<p><em>Hardiness, Might, Power</em><br />
Engaging in combat means enduring some amount of suffering and those who make use of Adamant Mountain maneuvers are well prepared to weather their opponents’ blows, relying not just on their might but the careful and expert application of force in all aspects of battle.</p>

<h3>Reactive Knockdown (1 point)</h3>
<p><em>2nd degree Adamant Mountain reaction</em><br />

<h2>Biting Zephyr Maneuvers</h2>
<p><em>Distance, Sharpshooting, Thrown Weapons</em><br />
Warriors that know Biting Zephyr techniques are superlative ranged combatants, not only for the accuracy of their attacks but also the myriad tricks they’ve mastered to routinely make shots that should be impossible.</p>
<h3>Covering Fire (1 point)</h3>
<p><em>1st degree Biting Zephyr action</em><br />
Choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within your weapon’s normal range. Until the start of your next turn, a chosen creature’s movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from creatures you can see as you pelt the area nearby with missiles.<br />
For each opportunity attack a chosen creature would have otherwise provoked, you expend one piece of ammunition or thrown weapon.</p>
<h3>Doubleshot (1 point)</h3>
<p><em>1st degree Biting Zephyr bonus action</em><br />

<h3>Farshot Stance (1 point)</h3>

When you use a weapon to make a ranged attack, increase its normal range by 20 feet and long range by 50 feet.</p>
<h3>Point Blank Shot (1 point)</h3>
<p><em>1st degree Biting Zephyr bonus action</em><br />
Until the end of your next turn, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated does not give you disadvantage when making a ranged attack using a weapon.<br />
In addition, when an adjacent hostile creature that you can see moves 5 feet or more away from you, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it.</p>
<h3>Countershot (1 point)</h3>
<p><em>2nd degree Biting Zephyr reaction</em><br />
When you see a missile from a ranged weapon attack enter into the normal range of a weapon you are wielding, you can use your reaction to deflect it. Use a weapon to make a ranged attack against an AC equal to the attack roll of the missile. On a hit, the missile is deflected and misses its target.<br />
At the Narrator’s discretion, certain ranged weapon attacks (like a giant’s thrown rock) may be too heavy to be deflected by Countershot.</p>
