<p>[Starting at 3rd level, when you make a Strength, Dexterity, or
Constitution check, you can add your martial arts die. When you fail a
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can use your
reaction to spend 2 exertion and reroll the save.]</p>
<h3>Master Athlete</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, your jump distances double, and you have
advantage on ability checks made to jump. In addition, you gain a climb
speed equal to your Speed and a swim speed equal to your Speed.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>[Finally, once per long rest when you would gain a level of fatigue, you
can choose not to gain that level of fatigue.]</p>
<h3>Sacred Boon</h3>
<p>[Starting at 11th level, choose three of the following benefits:]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>Boon of Death.[ When you reduce a living creature to 0 hit
points, you can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and gain a number
of temporary hit points equal to your martial arts die plus your
proficiency bonus. If you do, you have advantage on death saving throws
for 1 minute.]</p>
<p>Boon of Hunting.[ When you succeed on a Survival check to Hunt
and Gather as a journey activity, you gather twice as much Supply.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>Boon of Love.[ When you succeed on a Persuasion check to
influence a creature that is indifferent to you, you can spend 3
exertion to make that creature friendly towards you for 1 hour.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>Boon of Speed.[ When you move a distance greater than your Speed
during your turn, you can use your reaction to spend 2 exertion and take
the Dodge action.]</p>
<p>Boon of Tactics.[ When you make an opportunity attack, you can
spend 2 exertion to gain advantage on the attack.]</p>
<p>Boon of War. [When you critically hit a creature, you can use
your reaction to spend 2 exertion. If you do, your next successful melee
weapon attack deals additional damage equal to your martial arts die
plus your proficiency bonus.]</p>
<h3>Eternal Favor</h3>
<p>[At 17th level, you gain a token from the gods. While you are wearing
the token, you are immune to fatigue and the blinded, deafened, and
poisoned conditions. In addition, you can spend 1 exertion to use your
Blessed Prowess feature on any ability check, and you don't need to
spend exertion to use Sacred Boons. Finally, when you roll initiative,
you can roll your martial arts die and regain that much exertion.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>[If your Eternal Favor token is destroyed, the gods bestow another token
upon you after you complete an arduous task to prove you are still
worthy.]</p>
<h2>Warrior Monk</h2>
<h3>Lost Tradition</h3>
<p>[Starting at 3rd level, choose a combat tradition you are not proficient
in. You become proficient in that tradition. When you use a combat
maneuver that requires a weapon with a particular property (such as
finesse or heavy), your unarmed strikes count as having that
property.]</p>
<h3>Way of the Fist</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, you regain exertion equal to half your
proficiency bonus (rounded down) when you critically hit with an unarmed
strike. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1
exertion to deal additional damage equal to your martial arts die.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<h3>Ancestral Guidance</h3>
<p>[Starting at 11th level, you can meditate during a long rest. Choose a
combat tradition. If you are proficient in that tradition, learn two
maneuvers from it. If you are not proficient in that tradition, you
become proficient in it and learn two maneuvers from it. Combat
maneuvers learned through this feature are forgotten when you begin your
next long rest.]</p>
<h3>Perfect Fist</h3>
<p>[Starting at 17th level, when you make an unarmed strike, you score
critical hits on a roll of 19--20. If you already have a feature that
increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range
increases by 1 (maximum 17--20). In addition, when you use a bonus
action to make an unarmed strike, the attack deals an additional damage
die.]</p>
<p>When your unarmed strike reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you can
spend 3 exertion to utterly destroy the target's body and soul. The
target can't be restored to life by any means short of a [wish
]spell.</p>
<p>[When you hit a creature with two or more unarmed strikes in the same
turn, you can spend 3 exertion to force it to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the target suffers one effect you choose from
the list below. For each successful unarmed strike after the second, you
can spend 1 exertion to deal one additional effect. For example, if you
hit with four unarmed attacks, you can spend 5 exertion to deal three
effects. You can't choose the same effect more than once, and a
successful saving throw negates all effects.]</p>
<ul>
<li>[The target takes extra damage equal to twice your martial arts
    die.]</li>
<li>The target is blinded and deafened for 1 minute.</li>
<li>[The target is paralyzed for 1 minute. At the start of each of its
    turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
    a success.]</li>
<li>[The target is knocked prone and becomes poisoned for 1 minute.]{.c6
    .c17}</li>
<li>[Features, spells, and traits that would restore the target's hit
    points have no effect on the target until the start of your next
    turn.]</li>
<li>[The target loses a spell slot from its highest available
    level.]</li>
<li>The target loses 6 exertion.</li>
<li>[The target can't use bonus actions, legendary actions, or reactions
    until the start of your next turn.]</li>
<li>The target gains a level of fatigue.</li>

<p>Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma</p>
<p>Skills: Choose any three</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>[You begin the game with 135 gp. You can select your own gear or choose
one of the following equipment packages. Also consult the Suggested
Equipment section of your chosen background.]</p>
<ul>
<li>Agitator's Set (Cost 111 gp):[ Dagger, hand crossbow and
    quiver with 20 bolts, padded cloth, entertainer's pack, flute]{.c6
    .c17}</li>
<li>Ambassador's Set (Cost 91 gp):[ Longsword, shortbow with 20
    arrows, padded leather, diplomat's pack, violin]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Art Speciality</h2>
<p>[Starting at 1st level, any musical instrument that you have proficiency
with counts as a spell focus for the purposes of spellcasting. Although
spells can be cast without these instruments, only targets that are able
to perceive your performance can benefit from this feature. Whenever you
finish a rest, choose one of the following as your Art Specialty.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>Percussion (Casabas, Castanets, Drums, Maracas).[ Any instrument
played by being struck or scraped (either by other instruments or
against each other) qualifies as a percussion instrument. When you cast
a bard spell from the sound school using a percussion instrument as your
spell focus, double the spell\'s range. A sound spell that has a range
of Touch increases its range to 30 feet.]</p>
<p>String Instruments (Dulcimer, Harp, Lute, Lyre, Violin).[ String
instruments are played by plucking and twanging strings. When using a
string instrument as a spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell from
the movement or teleportation school, you can target an additional
creature within 15 feet of you.]</p>
<p>Visual (Calligraphy, Dance, Light Manipulation, Shapes).[ There
are many ways to undertake a visual performance, whether through
illustration, illusion magic, or legerdemain. When using visual art as a
spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell, you can make one ally that
can see you the point of origin of that spell. You must be able to see
any targets of the spell.]</p>
<p>Voice (Humming, Insults, Oration, Singing).[ When using this
musical art as a spell focus, you have advantage on checks made to
maintain concentration on a bard spell.]</p>
<p>[Wind Instruments (Bagpipes, Flute, Horn, Ocarina,
Trombone).][ Any instrument played by passing air through it
qualifies as a wind instrument. When you cast a bard spell using a wind
instrument as a spell focus, you can make a Deception or Performance
check as a part of casting the spell. Creatures with a passive Insight
score equal to or less than the result of your check do not see or hear
you cast the spell. Once you have used this feature three times, you
can't do so again until you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h2>Bardic Inspiration</h2>
<p>[A number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once) per
long rest, you can use a bonus action to choose one creature other than
yourself within 60 feet that can hear or see you. That creature gains a
d6 Bardic Inspiration die.]</p>
<p>[Within the next 10 minutes, before or after rolling an ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw (but before the result is determined), the
creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled
to the result. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is
expended. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a
time.]</p>
<p>[At 5th level, your Bardic Inspiration die increases to a d8. At 10th
level it increases to a d10, and at 15th level it increases to a
d12.]</p>
<h2>Battle Hymn</h2>
<p>[At 1st level, you learn a battle hymn, which can be expressed in any
type of performance. Once at the start of your turn, you can activate a
battle hymn by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action
is required). Performing a battle hymn requires your concentration, as
though you were casting a spell. Once activated, a battle hymn continues
until you lose concentration or the start of your next turn.]</p>
<p>[The number of battle hymns you know are listed in the Battle Hymns
Known column of the Bard table. Whenever you gain a bard level, you may
choose one battle hymn you know and replace it with a new battle hymn.
Your bard level determines what battle hymns you can learn.]</p>
<p>Audience.[ Unless otherwise noted, a battle hymn does not have a
target until you choose one, and each hymn targets a single creature
within 30 feet. You can choose to target a creature at any time, but
once you have chosen a target of your battle hymn, the hymn's target
can't be changed.]</p>
<p>Sustained Song.[ When you have an activated battle hymn but have
not chosen a creature to benefit from it yet, at the start of your turn
when it would end you can instead choose to sustain the battle hymn
until the start of your next turn without expending a use of Bardic
Inspiration.]</p>
<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>You learn two bard cantrips of your choice at 1st level and additional
bard cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
the Bard Spells table.</p>
<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
<p>[To cast a bard spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level
or higher. The Bard Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your bard spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.]</p>
<h3>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h3>
<p>[At 1st level, you know your choice of four 1st-level spells from the
bard spell list. Consult the Spells Known column of the Bard Spells
table to see when you can choose more bard spells. Each of these spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. ]</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a bard level, you can replace a bard spell
you know with another from the bard spell list, provided it is of a
level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
<p>[You can cast a bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell can be
cast as a ritual.]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>[Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. You use
your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier to set the attack bonus and
saving throw DC for your bard spells, as follows:]</p>
<p>Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier]</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
<p>[When casting a bard spell, you can use an arcane focus or Art
Speciality as your spellcasting focus.]</p>
<h2>Adventuring Tricks</h2>
<p>[At 2nd level, you learn one adventuring trick of your choice.
Adventuring tricks are detailed at the end of the class description. The
Tricks Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more
adventuring tricks.]</p>
<h2>Jack-of-All-Trades</h2>
<p>[Starting at 2nd Level, if you are not proficient with a skill or tool,
you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to ability checks
using that skill or tool.]</p>
<h2>Varied Expertise</h2>
<p>[Also at 2nd level, you gain an expertise die on one skill or tool of
your choice. At 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, choose an additional
skill or tool.]</p>
<h2>Bard Archetype</h2>
<p>[At 3rd level, choose a bard archetype. Your archetype grants you
features at 3rd, 6th, and 14th level.]</p>
<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
<p>[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]</p>
<h2>Bardic Legend</h2>
<p>[At 4th level, you write a bardic tale of your adventures. Your bardic
legend takes whatever form you like. When you enter a settlement and
spend a day playing or recounting the tale, the reputation of you and
your allies starts to grow. In addition to receiving local quests suited
to the exploits detailed in your bardic legend, when you rest in a
settlement that knows your bardic legend, you and your allies regain all
spent hit dice over the course of a long rest. In addition, you gain an
expertise die on Prestige checks made in the settlement.]</p>
<p>[Starting at 7th level, you craft a second bardic legend. Commoners are
either more amenable or afraid of you, depending on the type of bardic
legend you create. Choose one of the following skills: Deception,
Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. You gain advantage on checks made
using the chosen skill to influence any commoner that has heard your
bardic legend.]</p>
<p>[Beginning at 11th level, whenever you enter a settlement, you can name
a new bardic legend of your choice. Allies that are part of the tale
gain inspiration when they finish a long rest in that settlement. Any
other creatures that are part of that tale have their reputations
ruined---either they confront you directly to stop the rumor, or they
are unable to hide or deal in that town for the length of time you are
in it. Once you have used this feature in a settlement, you can't do so
again until you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h2>Battle Hymn Focus</h2>
<p>[Also at 4th level, at the end of another creature's turn, you can use
your reaction to activate a battle hymn. This battle hymn replaces any
currently activated battle hymns. Replacing an activated battle hymn
does not require expending a use of Bardic Inspiration if the previously
activated hymn doesn't have a target.]</p>
<p>In addition, choose one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your battle hymns don't require concentration.</li>
<li>[Your battle hymns can affect a number of additional creatures equal
    to your Charisma modifier (minimum one).]</li>
<li>[You learn an additional battle hymn, which doesn't count against
    the number of battle hymns you know. When choosing this battle hymn,
    treat your bard level as four higher for the purposes of meeting the
    hymn's prerequisites. If you change this Battle Hymn Focus, you
    forget the additional battle hymn.]</li>
</ul>
<p>[Whenever you gain a bard level, you can change your Battle Hymn
Focus.]</p>
<h2>Renewed Inspiration</h2>
<p>[Starting at 5th level, you regain all expended uses of Bardic
Inspiration whenever you finish a rest.]</p>
<h2>Key Change</h2>
<p>[Also at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to change your Art
Speciality. Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until
you finish a rest.]</p>
<h2>Prestigious</h2>
<p>[Beginning at 6th level, your Prestige rating increases by an amount
equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). When you reach 11th
level, your Prestige rating instead increases by an amount equal to your
proficiency bonus.]</p>
<h2>Maestro</h2>
<p>[At 7th level, choose one Art Speciality. You always gain the benefits
of that Art Speciality, no matter what instrument or art you are
using.]</p>
<h2>Battle Hymn Specialization</h2>
<p>[At 8th level, the range of your battle hymns increases to 60 feet.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>In addition, choose one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>[You can expend two uses of Bardic Inspiration to activate two
    Battle Hymns at the same time. Losing concentration or changing
    battle hymns ends both hymns.]</li>
<li>[Pick three spells of 4th-level or lower that have only vocalized
    components. These spells can be from any class spell list. You can
    spend two uses of Bardic Inspiration to cast one of the chosen
    spells at the start of your turn without using an action. If you do,
    you can't activate a battle hymn that turn.]</li>
<li>[When you expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to activate a battle
    hymn, you can also grant a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature
    within 60 feet.]</li>
</ul>
<p>[Whenever you gain a bard level, you can change your Battle Hymn
Specialization.]</p>
<h3>Art Mastery</h3>
<p>[At 11th level, you gain one of the following art masteries. At 17th
level, you gain an additional art mastery.]</p>
<p>Percussion: Rolling Rhythm.[ When using a percussion instrument
as a spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets only one creature,
you can target an additional creature. The additional target must be
within range of the first (as if the original target were casting the
spell). You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your
proficiency bonus (rounded down) per rest.]</p>
<p>String Instruments: Melody for All.[ You gain a number of melody
charges equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), which you regain
whenever you finish a long rest. When using a string instrument as a
spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can
spend a melody charge to target an additional creature within the
spell's range.]</p>
<p>Visual: Dual Masterpiece.[ When using visual art as a spell
focus, if you cast a bard spell that uses an ally as its point of origin
and then cast that spell again on your next turn, the spell is cast as
if you had used a spell slot two levels higher. You can use this feature
a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>Voice: Everlasting Song.[ When concentrating on a bard spell you
cast using your voice as a spell focus, you automatically succeed on
checks made to maintain concentration on that spell.]</p>
<p>Wind Instruments: Perfect Pitch.[ While using a wind instrument
as a spell focus, you gain advantage on Deception and Performance checks
to conceal the casting of bard spells.]</p>
<h2>Universal Trick</h2>
<p>[At 13th, 16th, and 19th level, you learn a developed talent from the
berserker class, a sign of faith from the cleric class, a soldiering
knack from the fighter class, or an elective study from the wizard
class. You can't learn more than one Universal Trick from any individual
class.]</p>
<h2>Grand Battle Hymns</h2>
<p>[At 17th level,  you learn one of the following grand battle hymns,
which doesn't count against the number of battle hymns you know.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>Beyond the Grave.[ When you activate this hymn, each ally within
60 feet that is bloodied or unconscious is restored to half their hit
point maximum. In addition, each target recovers from up to 3 levels of
fatigue.]</p>
<p>Magic Never Dies.[ When you activate this hymn, each ally within
30 feet regains up to five levels worth of spell slots or gains 30
temporary hit points.]</p>
<p>Taste of Victory.[ When you activate this hymn, each ally within
30 feet of you gains a blessing of victory that lasts for 24 hours or
until it is expended. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or
contested ability check, they can expend their blessing of victory to
gain advantage on the roll.]</p>
<p>[Once you have activated your grand battle hymn, you can't do so again
until you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h2>Virtuoso</h2>
<p>[At 20th level, you can use an action and expend a use of Bardic
Inspiration to start an epic performance that lasts for 1d4 rounds.
While the performance lasts, you can choose up to 50 creatures that are
within 120 feet and that can hear or see your performance. Each creature
you choose makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target
is charmed by you for the performance's duration and for 6 days
afterwards, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. A
charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance.]</p>
<p>[The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced, or if
you voluntarily end it (no action required). At the end of the
performance, you can extend the duration by 1d4 rounds by expending an

not receive an action.]</p>
<h3>Honeyed Words</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell, you can replace any
vocalized components with speech and any seen components with gestures.
Any observers with a passive Insight score equal to or less than your

bonus per long rest.]</p>

new Victorious Hymn.]</p>
<h3>Second Chorus</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, when you see a spell cast on an ally within 30
feet, you can use your reaction and expend a use of Bardic Inspiration.
If the spell is 3rd level or lower, targets only that ally, and you are
also within the spell's range, you are also targeted by the spell.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>[When you reach 14th level in this class, you can expend two uses of
Bardic Inspiration to target a different ally instead of you.]</p>

<h3>Juggernaut</h3>
<p>[You gain proficiency with heavy armor. In addition, your speed is not
reduced by wearing heavy armor, you can still benefit from raging while

    berserker, as shown in the Rage Hit Points column of the Berserker
    table. Whenever you take damage, you reduce your rage hit points
    first, then your regular hit points. Rage hit points stack each

from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree
column shows the highest-degree maneuver you can select at a given
level.]</p>
<p>[Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
degree from a tradition you are proficient with.]</p>

have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can
see.]</p>
<h2>Furious Critical</h2>
<p>[Also at 2nd level, choose one Furious Critical. At 4th level and every
even berserker level after, you learn an additional Furious
Critical.]</p>
<p>[Unless otherwise noted, the DC to resist your Furious Critical effects
is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The

damage the creature took from the attack that inflicted the condition,
whichever is higher.]</p>
<h3>Disorienting Strike</h3>
<p>[When you critically hit, the target treats all creatures as though they
have half cover (+2 to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks
made to hide). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your
proficiency bonus and does not stack with subsequent critical hits.]{.c6
.c17}</p>

effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus and
does not stack with successive critical hits.]</p>

levels, increasing the damage each time; 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 16th

your Furious Critical DC).]</p>
<h3>Relentless Attack</h3>

weapon attack without using an action or reaction to do so. If this
subsequent attack is also a critical hit, you can activate this feature
again, up to a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus
(rounded down). You can't combine the effects of another Furious
Critical during these additional attacks.]</p>
<h3>Terrifying Force</h3>

<h2>Notable Reputation</h2>

<p>[In addition, while swimming you can use a bonus action and spend one
use of Rage to move your swim speed in a straight line.]</p>
<h3>Path of Lean Winters</h3>
<p>[You gain advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of cold
weather, as though you were wearing cold weather gear but without the
disadvantages in hot weather. Additionally, you can go without Supply
for a number of days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1)
before suffering a level of fatigue.]</p>
<h3>Path of Scorching Summers</h3>
<p>[You gain advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of hot
weather, as though you were wearing hot weather gear but without the
disadvantages in cold weather. You also gain advantage on saving throws
made to resist the effects of thirst.]</p>
<h3>Sharpened Senses</h3>
<p>[You gain an expertise die on Investigation, Perception, or Survival
checks made to follow a creature's trail.]</p>
<h1>Berserker Archetypes</h1>
<h2>Dreadnought</h2>
<h3>Leveling Charge</h3>
<p>[Starting at 3rd level, if you hit a creature with an attack after
moving at least 20 feet, you can attempt to knock that creature to the
ground. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your
Furious Critical DC or be knocked prone.]</p>
<p>[At 10th level, you can use a bonus action to attempt to knock down a
creature that is within your reach during your Leveling Charge.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<h3>Standing Firm</h3>
<p>[Also at 3rd level, you gain advantage on ability checks and saving
throws made to avoid being knocked prone. In addition, while you are
wearing heavy armor, when a creature you can see attacks a target other
than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on the attack roll.]</p>
<h3>Ever Onwards</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, while you are raging you ignore all movement
penalties caused by difficult terrain.]</p>
<p>[In addition, while raging you gain advantage on saving throws made to
resist being charmed or frightened.]</p>
<h3>Terrifying Inevitability</h3>
<p>[Beginning at 10th level, you gain an aura that extends 10 feet from you
in every direction, but not through total cover. While raging you can
use a bonus action to choose one creature you can see in your aura and
focus your will on it. If the creature can see or hear you, it must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of
your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to
extend the duration of this effect until the end of your next turn. The
effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more
than 60 feet away from you.]</p>
<p>[A creature that successfully saves is immune to your Terrifying
Inevitability for 24 hours.]</p>
<h3>Rebounding Blow</h3>
<p>[Starting at 14th level, while you are wearing heavy armor and a
creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a weapon attack, you can
use your reaction to turn the miss into a hit. You take half damage from
the attack, and the triggering creature takes an equal amount of
damage.]</p>
<h2>Rager</h2>
<h3>Hard to Kill</h3>
<p>[Starting at 3rd level, when you drop to 0 hit points, you can
immediately make a death saving throw. On a success, you instead gain a
number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) and
don't lose the benefits of your rage. Once you have used this feature,
you can't do so again until you finish a rest.]</p>
<h3>Enraged Focus</h3>
<p>[Also at 3rd level, while you are raging, you gain an expertise die on
your first attack roll each round.]</p>
<h3>Thirst for the Kill</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
points, the next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack in the
next minute, you gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to the triggering
creature's Hit Die.]</p>
<h3>Relentless</h3>
<p>[Starting at 10th level, if a creature uses the Disengage action to
leave your reach while you are raging, you can use your reaction to
follow them a number of feet equal to double your Speed. You can use
this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long
rest.]</p>
<h3>Pitiless Gaze</h3>
<p>[Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you
with a melee attack while you are raging, that creature takes 1d6
psychic damage.]</p>
<h2>Tempest</h2>
<h3>Touched by Thunder</h3>
<p>[Beginning at 3rd level, you can empower a melee weapon you touch. While
you are raging, your attacks with the weapon deal an additional 1d6
lightning or thunder damage (choose the damage type when you begin the
rage). This damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level,
and 4d6 at 20th level. You can empower only one weapon at a time, but
you can use a bonus action to transfer the effect to a different
weapon.]</p>
<p>[In addition, you gain resistance to either lightning or thunder damage,
chosen by you when you gain this feature.]</p>
<h3>Whirling Winds</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, while raging you have an aura extending 10 feet
from you in every direction, but not through total cover. While the aura
lasts, treat all attacks against you as though you had half cover (+2 to
AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide).]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>[In addition, you gain resistance to either lightning or thunder damage,
whichever you did not choose at 3rd level.]</p>
<h3>Forceful Gale</h3>
<p>[Starting at 10th level, once per turn while you are raging, when you
damage a creature with a melee attack you can force the target to make a
Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength
modifier). On a failed save, you can push the creature up to 10 feet
directly away from you. This distance stacks with any forced movement
caused by a Furious Critical.]</p>
<h3>Perfect Storm</h3>
<p>[Starting at 14th level, a hostile creature that begins its turn inside
your Whirling Winds aura makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your
proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). The creature takes
lightning or thunder damage (the same damage type you chose when you
gained the Touched by Thunder feature) equal to your berserker level on
a failure or half damage on a success.]</p>

Performance to deliver a sermon or to sing holy songs in a town or city,
even on a failed check other than a natural 1, you still attract a crowd
of people no smaller than your spell save DC.]</p>
<h3>Ordination</h3>
<p>[As a formal leader within your religious order, you are expected to
perform the ceremonies of your faith, including weddings and funerals.
In exchange, members of your faith provide you and your companions with
food, lodging, and a modest lifestyle.]</p>
<p>[Additionally, if your congregation or order is able, they send you
letters with regular updates about their well-being. They are willing to
help connect you with other chapters of your faith through letters of
introduction.]</p>
<h3>Zeal of the Convert</h3>
<p>[You gain advantage on Persuasion checks when you invoke the name of
your deity or movement during a conversation with a pious person. If the

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>You learn three cleric cantrips of your choice at 1st level and
additional cleric cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Cleric Spells table. You also know the
thaumaturgy cantrip.</p>
<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
<p>[To prepare cleric spells to make them available to cast, choose a
number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level
(minimum of one spell) from the cleric spell list. You can't prepare a
spell with a higher level than your highest-level spell slot.]</p>
<p>[To cast a cleric spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell's
level or higher. The Cleric Spells table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your cleric spells. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.]</p>
<p>[Casting spells doesn't remove them from your list of prepared
spells.]</p>
<p>[During a long rest, you can change your list of prepared spells by
meditating.]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>[Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You use
your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier to set the attack bonus and
saving throw DC for your cleric spells, as follows:]</p>
<p>Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier]</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your
Wisdom modifier]</p>
<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>

cast as a ritual. You can also cast the ]ceremony [spell as
a ritual whether you have the spell prepared or not.]</p>

spellcasting focus.]</p>
<h2>Channel Divinity</h2>

greater entity. You start with two ways to channel divinity: Turn Undead
and an additional effect dependent on your chosen Cleric Archetype.]{.c6
.c17}</p>
<p>[You may choose which Channel Divinity effect to create each time you
use this feature. You must then finish a rest before you're able to
Channel Divinity again.]</p>
<p>[If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, use your cleric
spell save DC.]</p>
<p>[Starting at 6th level you can use your Channel Divinity twice between
rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between
rests.]</p>
<h3>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h3>
<p>[As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a divine word.
Each undead creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage. ][A turned creature must use its movement to move
away from you and its actions to Dash or to escape from an effect that
prevents it from moving away. If it can't move away, it can take the
Dodge action. It can't willingly approach within 30 feet of you and it
can't take reactions.]</p>
<h2>Principles of Devotion</h2>
<p>[At 2nd level, you pledge to uphold certain standards of behavior beyond
what is necessary for adventure. In return, your greater entity grants
you one of the following related boons. When you fail to uphold this
pledge, you lose any benefits from it until 24 hours after you finish a
long rest and rededicate yourself.]</p>
<h3>Chaste</h3>
<p>[In exchange for forgoing pleasures of the heart and flesh, you are
hardened to the persuasions of others. Add your Wisdom modifier (minimum
+1) to saving throws made to resist being charmed. You also gain one
skill specialty chosen from Insight, Persuasion, or Religion.]</p>
<h3>Destitute</h3>
<p>[In exchange for forgoing material luxury, vendors who are not
explicitly opposed to your greater entity are compelled to give you
heavy discounts of up to 20 percent, and inkeeps offer you free
lodging.]</p>
<h3>Devotional Integrity</h3>
<p>[When an action you take is honest and non-violent, until the end of
your turn you are immune to the rattled condition and you do not suffer
disadvantage or penalties on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks
made as part of that action.]</p>
<h3>Image of the Divine</h3>
<p>[You exhibit a uniform, makeup, tattoo, or body modification indicating
your higher entity or religious order. Creatures have advantage when
discerning your religious identity. You gain advantage on saving throws
against fear and ability checks made against Intimidation. You also gain
one skill specialty chosen from Insight, Intimidation, or
Persuasion.]</p>
<h3>Merciful</h3>
<p>[In exchange for forgoing bloodshed---torture, attacking unconscious
creatures, and dealing lethal wounds to creatures you reduce to 0 hit
points---you are yourself granted mercy. When you have already succeeded
on two death saving throws, you have advantage on death saving
throws.]</p>
<h3>Rule of Ritual</h3>
<p>[You make formal religious observances and perform ritual timekeeping.
You can spend 1 hour during a long rest to make these observances, and
if you do you only need 4 hours of sleep instead of the normal 6. You
learn the ]guidance [cantrip if you don't already know it,
and when you use a spell of 1st-level or higher to grant an expertise
die, the expertise die you grant increases by one step.]</p>
<h3>Secrecy</h3>
<p>[Your mission from your deity requires you to work undercover,
concealing your true self with a secret identity. In exchange for
forgoing the pleasure of true connection and friendship, you gain an
expertise die on Deception checks.]</p>
<h3>Severity</h3>
<p>[In exchange for forgoing weaknesses such as helping or protecting
others (except when it serves you), you add your Wisdom modifier
(minimum +1) to Perception checks made to find valuable objects, and on
contested checks made against the Persuasion check of another
creature.]</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>[The only time you may speak is while casting spells. Otherwise you
adhere to a vow of silence. In exchange, others can feel your dedication
and intent with a mere glance. When a creature within 10 feet of you
makes a Persuasion check, you can add your Wisdom modifier (minimum +1)
to the result.]</p>
<h2>Signs of Faith</h2>
<p>[At 3rd level, you gain a sign of faith of your choice. Signs of faith
are detailed at the end of your class description. The Signs Known
column of the Cleric table shows when you gain new signs.]</p>

an expertise die on Persuasion checks related to seeking aid.]</p>

give and courtesy calls you make to different religious groups put you
in contact with a local representative of your faith, who is happy to
strongly recommend you to another local leader. You gain one specialty
chosen from Culture, Insight, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain an
expertise die on Culture, Insight, and Persuasion checks made against
local leaders to whom you are recommended that would otherwise be
indifferent towards you.]</p>
<h3>Engaging Proclaimer</h3>
<p>[You gain an expertise die on Performance checks to gather and hold the
attention of two or more people. In addition, you gain two skill
specialties, chosen from Performance or Religion.]</p>
<h3>Reputation</h3>
<p>[Common folk frequently recognize you on sight, and those who do often
have a friendly disposition towards you. They often ask you for counsel,
favors, and blessings. The disposition of people they introduce you to
are one step better than normal (the indifferent become friendly, the
hostile become indifferent).]</p>
<h3>Symbol of Might</h3>
<p>[You gain one Intimidation specialty, and you gain an expertise die on
Intimidation checks made to convince others to comply with your demands.
The people you intimidate are no longer friendly towards you, if they
were previously.]</p>
<h2>Empowered Turning</h2>
<p>[At 5th level your greater entity grants you improved ways to turn
undead or other abhorrent beings. You gain this feature again at 8th,
11th, 14th, and 17th level. Each time you gain Empowered Turning, choose
one of the following:]</p>
<h3>Command Undead</h3>
<p>[If you choose, creatures you turn instead regard you as their master
for the duration. While they are under this effect, you can use your
action to issue simple commands (no more than a sentence or two) which
they are compelled to obey. They will not take any action that is
obviously harmful to them, and so will not leap from a great height,
jump onto a sword, or purposefully self-inflict any damage. They follow
the command until you issue a new one.]</p>
<h3>Destroy Undead</h3>
<p>[Creatures turned by you of CR 1/2 or less are immediately destroyed,
transformed into dust by a blinding flash of light. You can select this
option multiple times. Each time you choose it, you are able to destroy
more powerful creatures, progressing to CR 1, CR 2, CR 3, and then CR 4
each subsequent time you select this option.]</p>
<h3>Turn Ideology</h3>
<p>[Choose one of the following: Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful. When you

alignment trait. You can select this option multiple times, choosing a
different alignment trait each time.]</p>
<h3>Turn Supernatural</h3>
<p>[Choose a creature type from celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend. When
you use Turn Undead, you can also choose to affect creatures of that
type. You can select this option multiple times, choosing a different
creature type each time.]</p>

go. Choose one of the following.]</p>
<h3>Cosmic Idealist</h3>

and Evil, Chaotic and Good, Lawful and Evil, or Lawful and Good. You
gain the chosen alignment trait or alignment traits. You can identify
creatures that have the same alignment traits as you, and you have
advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability checks you make
against them.]</p>
<p>[Additionally, you do not suffer negative effects from being on a plane
with which you share an alignment trait.]</p>
<h3>Eyes of the Heart</h3>
<p>[When you succeed on a contested Insight check, if the opposing
creature's Charisma score is equal to or less than your spell save DC,
for the next 24 hours you do not need to make any further checks to
recognize whenever that creature is lying, telling the truth, or
withholding information.]</p>
<h3>Spiritual Salve</h3>
<p>[Your constant encouragements and proverbs allow allies within 30 feet
of you to reroll a Constitution check or saving throw that they fail. If
they do so, they must use the new roll. This feature can't be used on
saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell. Once a creature
has used your Spiritual Salve to make a reroll, it can't do so again
until it has finished a long rest.]</p>
<h2>Providence</h2>
<p>[At 10th level, the potency of your faith increases. Choose one of the
following.]</p>
<h3>Divine Intervention</h3>

or lower than your cleric level, your request is granted in a manner
chosen by the Narrator. The Narrator chooses the nature of the
intervention, which might take the form of the effect of any cleric
spell or cleric archetype spell. You can use this feature once between
long rests, but you if your deity intervenes you can't use it again for
7 days.]</p>
<p>[After each failed divine intervention roll, add 1 to the number
required to succeed until it is a success, at which point it resets to
your cleric level.]</p>
<p>[At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h3>Imminent Turning</h3>
<p>You can Turn Undead from up to 60 feet away.</p>
<h3>Master Ritualist</h3>

cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, psychic, radiant, or thunder.
You gain resistance to this damage type until the end of your next long
rest.]</p>
<h2>Avatar of Faith</h2>
<p>[At 20th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to become a conduit of
the divine, flooding the world around you with the unfettered power of
the Moral Planes. Once you have used either of these options, you can't
use that option again until you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h3>Channel Negative Energy</h3>
<p>[Each creature of your choice that you can see must make a Charisma
saving throw, taking 5d10 damage force damage and 5d10 necrotic damage
on a failure or half damage on a success.]</p>
<p>[When you use this feature, you also choose one of the following
conditions: blinded, confused, deafened, frightened, poisoned, rattled,
or slowed. A creature that failed its saving throw also gains the chosen
condition. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the
saving throw to end the effect on itself.]</p>

have the Evil alignment trait. Each creature regains 5d10 hit
points.]</p>
<h3>Channel Positive Energy</h3>
<p>[You restore up to 200 hit points, divided as you choose among any
number of creatures that you can see.]</p>
<p>[A creature that regains hit points from this feature also recovers from
one level of fatigue and one level of strife, and if it is blinded,
charmed, confused, deafened, doomed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified,
poisoned, rattled, slowed, or stunned, those conditions end for it. This
feature can't be used on undead or constructs.]</p>
<h1>Signs of Faith</h1>
<p>[When you gain access to a new sign of faith, choose one of the
following.]</p>
<h2>Ancestral Guidance</h2>
<p>[In addition to the spells you normally prepare, you always have
]speak with dead[ prepared, and you can use this feature to
cast it once between long rests without spending a spell slot. When you
do so, you do not have to target a corpse; you can also target a grave
marker, memorial, statue, painting, or other depiction of the deceased
creature you wish to talk to. If the chosen creature is not dead, or if
such a creature never existed in the first place, the spell fails.]{.c6

own hit dice while using this feature, since you use all of your
energies to heal your companions.]</p>
<h2>Graceful Fall</h2>

to intervene. You are protected as if by the ][feather

on Arcana and Medicine checks made to interact with magical wounds and
maladies caused by celestials, fiends, and fey.]</p>
<h2>Premonition</h2>
<p>[You have the ability to interpret messages sent to you in dreams or
visions by your greater entity. After each long rest, you receive one of
the following:]</p>
<ul>
<li>[A piece of information that will help in your endeavors before the
    end of your next long rest,]</li>
<li>[A premonition. Roll a d20. Before the end of your next long rest,
    you can choose to replace any roll made by a creature within 30 feet
    that you can see with the result of this d20 roll.]</li>
</ul>
<p>[The Narrator lets you know which benefit is available whenever you
finish a long rest.]</p>

disease in food, drink, or other consumables. You must make direct

corruption.]</p>

While walking the Righteous Path, you are aware when enemies are within

within 30 feet, but not the location or nature of the traps.]</p>
<h2>Soothing Words</h2>
<p>[Once between long rests, you can reduce one ally's strife by one
level.]</p>
<h2>Supernal Intuition</h2>

undead. You know when a creature of this type is within 60 feet of you,
although you don't know its location. The ][nondetection
][spell protects against this feature. You can select this sign
multiple times, choosing a different creature type each time.]</p>
<h2>Theologian</h2>
<p>[You gain an expertise die on Religion checks. In addition, you can use
Wisdom when making Religion checks.]</p>
<h2>Voice of Doom</h2>

<h3>Unfickle Fate</h3>
<p>[Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, once between long
rests you can use an action to touch a willing creature and grant them a
single premonition that they remember for 1 hour. While they remember
the premonition, the creature can choose to reroll an attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw and use the new result, after which the
premonition is gone from its mind.]</p>
<h3>Channel Divinity: All-Seeing Oracle</h3>
<p>[Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly
look through the eyes of another creature you name. As long as the
creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, you recall a still
image of its surroundings exactly as it saw them in a single moment. If
the creature is dead, blinded, unconscious, or protected from divination
magic, this feature has no effect.]</p>
<h3>Channel Divinity: Aural Oracle</h3>
<p>[At 6th level, you are able to use your Channel Divinity to see and hear
through the senses of another creature you name for 1 minute. As long as
the creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, it makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see what it sees and hear
what it hears. An unconscious creature automatically fails its save but
only hears (it sees nothing). You can't see through the eyes of a
blinded creature or hear through the ears of a deafened creature. If the
creature is dead or protected from divination magic, this feature has no
effect. While using this feature, you become blinded and deafened to
your surroundings. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this
feature for 24 hours.]</p>
<h3>Potent Premonitions</h3>
<p>[Starting at 8th level, your premonitions are more powerful. Your
Unfickle Fate feature now lasts up to 8 hours. In addition, you gain one
premonition per long rest. Roll a d20. Before the end of your next long
rest, you can choose to replace any roll made by a creature within 30
feet that you can see with the result of this d20 roll.]</p>
<h3>Channel Divinity: All-Powerful Oracle</h3>
<p>[Starting at 17th level, your ability to see from the perspective of
another creature using Channel Divinity reaches its ultimate form. As
long as the creature you name is alive and on the same plane of
existence, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see and
hear everything the creature sees and hears for up to a number of
minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 minute).]</p>
<p>[In addition, you can access all of the creature's memories and
knowledge related to a single object, place, person, or subject. The
subject and place must be somewhat specific. ]</p>
<p>[You can't see through the eyes of a blinded creature or hear through
the ears of a deafened creature. If the creature is dead or protected
from divination magic, this feature has no effect. An unconscious
creature automatically fails its saving throw and you may hear what it
hears and access its knowledge. While using this feature, you become
blinded and deafened to your surroundings. On a successful save, a
creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours.]</p>

long rest.]</p>
<h3>Channel Divinity: Summon the Stars</h3>
<p>[Starting at 17th level, you can use an action to choose an object or
creature you can see within 60 feet. For 1 minute, the target emits
bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30
feet. When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the target or
first enters a space within 30 feet of the target on its turn, it must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A
blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.]</p>
<p>[The first time you use this feature  per long rest, each creature
within 30 feet of the target takes 12d6 radiant damage on a failed save,
or half damage on a success. Magical auras within the light's radius
become visible, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 hour. An
invisible creature that fails its saving throw against the radiant
damage is also revealed, and it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1
hour.]</p>

the end of the class description. The Secrets Known column of the Druid
table shows when you learn more secrets of nature.]</p>
<h2>Druidic Training</h2>
<p>Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Nature skill.</p>
<p>[You can speak, sign, and understand the secret language Druidic. You
can write in Druidic, which looks like random scratches to non-speakers.
Non-Druidic speakers can spot Druidic and discern that it is writing
with a successful DC 15 Perception check but can't read it without
magic.]</p>
<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>You learn two druid cantrips of your choice at 1st level and additional
druid cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column
of the Druid Spells table. You also know the
druidcraft cantrip.</p>
<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
<p>[To prepare druid spells to make them available to cast, choose a number
of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of
one spell) from the druid spell list. You can't prepare a spell with a
higher level than your highest-level spell slot.]</p>
<p>[To cast a druid spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell's level
or higher. The Druid Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your druid spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.]</p>
<p>[Casting spells doesn't remove them from your list of prepared
spells.]</p>
<p>[During a long rest, you can change your list of prepared spells by
meditating.]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>[Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier to set the attack bonus and
saving throw DC for your druid spells, as follows:]</p>
<p>Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier]</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your
Wisdom modifier]</p>
<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
<p>[You can cast a druid spell you know as a ritual if that spell can be
cast as a ritual. ]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
<p>[When casting a druid spell, you can use a nature focus as your
spellcasting focus.]</p>
<h2>Druid Archetype</h2>
<p>[At 2nd level, you choose a circle of druids to identify with. Your
choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
level.]</p>
<h2>Wild Shape</h2>
<p>[At 2nd level, you know 3 wild shapes of your choice for creatures of CR
1/2 or less that have the beast or plant type. You learn additional and
more powerful wild shapes of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
the Wild Shapes Known column of the Druid table.]</p>
<p>[Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
wild shapes you know with a new one.]</p>
<p>[As an action you can magically assume one of your known wild shapes.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.]</p>
<p>[Whenever you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into a creature,
you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d4 × the creature's
CR (minimum 1d4).]</p>
<p>[You can stay in a wild shape for a number of hours equal to your druid
level. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use
of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a
bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall
unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.]</p>
<p>While you are transformed, the following</p>
<p>rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>[You use the statistics of the creature, except you retain your hit
    points and hit dice, personality, the ability to speak and
    understand any languages you know, and your Intelligence, Wisdom,
    and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving
    throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
    If the creature has a higher bonus to a skill or saving throw, you
    may use the creature's bonus instead.]</li>
<li>[You gain all of the wild shape's senses, movement speeds,
    resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities, traits, actions, and
    attacks. If you use a creature's Multiattack action, you can't make
    any further attacks that turn, even if another feature would
    normally allow you to do so.]</li>
<li>[While in a wild shape, your Armor Class equals 12 + 1/4 your druid
    level, as shown on the Wild Shapes table. If your wild shape would
    have a higher AC, you may use that instead.]</li>
<li>[While in a wild shape, you can only cast spells with a range of
    Self or Touch. You can perform the verbal and somatic components of
    such spells while in a wild shape, and your wild shape itself acts
    as your spellcasting focus. Transforming doesn't break your
    concentration on a spell you've already cast, nor does it prevent
    you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as
    ]call lightning, that you've already cast.</li>
<li>[You retain the benefit of any features from your class, destiny, or
    culture and can use them if your wild shape is physically capable of
    doing so. However, you can't utilize any features gained from your
    heritage or heritage gift while in a wild shape.]</li>
<li>[Any equipment you are wearing or wielding merges into your new
    form. Equipment that merges with your form has no effect until you
    leave the form.]</li>

<h2>Nature's Bond</h2>

.c7}</p>
<h2>Natural Demeanor</h2>
<p>At 3rd level, choose one of the following:</p>
<h3>A Way With Animals</h3>
<p>[Beasts understand anything you verbally communicate in Druidic, and you
can comprehend them in return. Beasts can usually give you information

persuade a beast to perform a small task. In addition, you gain an
expertise die on Animal Handling checks.]</p>
<h3>Firsthand Naturalist</h3>

<li>[The direction of the nearest city or other humanoid community.]{.c6
    .c7}</li>
<li>[The general health of the local ecosystem and if anything unnatural
    or magical is upsetting the natural order.]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scholar of Old Ways</h3>
<p>[You gain proficiency with Arcana, or if you already have proficiency
you instead gain an expertise die on Arcana checks. In addition, you can
use Wisdom when making Arcana checks.]</p>
<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
<p>[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]</p>
<h2>Druidic Lore</h2>
<p>At 7th level, choose one of the following:</p>
<h3>Druidic Secrets</h3>
<p>[Once between long rests, when you cast a druid spell you can choose to
utilize silent and subtle Druidic motions and signs in place of both the
spell's seen and vocalized components. Creatures that can speak Druidic
recognize these gestures.]</p>
<h3>Toxin Intuition</h3>
<p>[You automatically know if any flora or fauna is poisonous or venomous.
In addition, you gain advantage on checks made to determine if a
foodstuff is poisonous and saving throws against poison.]</p>
<h3>Truthspeaker</h3>
<p>Once between long rests, you can cast the spell [legend
lore][ without expending a spell slot and without material
components.]</p>
<h3>Waste Not</h3>
<p>[With 10 minutes work you can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of
a beast, dragon, monstrosity, or plant of CR 1 or higher that has died
within the last hour. If sold to a collector, naturalist, or other
druid, this notable component is worth an amount of gold equal to 5 ×
the creature's CR.]</p>
<h2>Ferocity or Serenity</h2>
<p>At 9th level, choose one of the following:</p>
<h3>Embraced Ferocity</h3>
<p>[You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls you make while in a wild shape. In
addition, whenever you use Wild Shape to transform into a creature, you
gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 × the creature's CR
(minimum 1d8) instead of 1d4 × CR.]</p>
<h3>Embraced Serenity</h3>
<p>[You have advantage on Constitution checks and savings throws made to
maintain concentration on a spell. In addition, as a bonus action you
can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to recover an expended spell
slot of 3rd-level or lower, or two uses to recover an expended spell
slot of 6th-level or lower.]</p>
<h2>Improved Natural Bond</h2>
<p>[At 11th level, as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape
feature to cast the ]conjure animals spell.</p>
<h2>Harmonize or Tyrannize</h2>
<p>At 15th level, choose one of the following:</p>
<h3>Harmonize</h3>
<p>[During a short rest, you can choose to meditate and harmonize with your
surroundings. If you do, at the end of the rest you attune to the area
in a 5-mile radius around you. You magically know what types of
creatures are present, their approximate numbers, and if there are any
magics disturbing the natural order in your attuned area. While in your
attuned area, you have blindsight out to a range of 30 feet and
advantage on Nature, Perception, and Survival checks. Once attuned to an
area, you remain attuned for the next 24 hours. You can attune to only
one area at a time.]</p>
<h3>Tyrannize</h3>
<p>[Whenever you transform into a wild shape, you can assume the apex form
of that wild shape. An apex form is one size category larger than the
creature's normal size category (to a maximum of Gargantuan) and any
attack made by an apex form wild shape deals an extra 1d8 damage. In
addition, while in an apex form wild shape you gain an expertise die on
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks and saving throws.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h2>Greater Natural Bond</h2>
<p>[At 18th level your bond expands to encompass the Dreaming. As an
action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the
]conjure woodland beings[ spell as if using a 6th-level
spell slot.]</p>
<h2>Archdruid</h2>
<p>[At 20th level, you become an extension of nature. Your Wild Shape
feature has no duration. In addition, when you cast a druid spell you
don't need seen or vocalized components or any material components that
have no cost and aren't consumed by the casting. You gain this benefit
in both your normal shape and while using Wild Shape.]</p>
<p>[You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of life around
you and how to divert it as you see fit. You can cast the spells
]power word kill and [true
resurrection][ without expending a spell slot and without any
material components. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't
do so again until you finish a long rest.]</p>
<p>[Finally, you can turn nature in its rawest elements into deadly weapons
no matter your form. As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose a
point within 30 feet and one of the following element options. If the
element you choose is not present at or near the target point, damage
dealt by this feature is halved, you have disadvantage on your spell
attack, and creatures have advantage on saving throws made to resist the
effect.]</p>
<p>Air.[ Each creature within 20 feet of the point you choose
must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes
bludgeoning damage equal to 3d8 + your Wisdom modifier and is flung up
to 20 feet away from the origin point in a random direction and is
knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or
floor, the target takes an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. If the
target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or it takes the same
damage and is knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the
target takes half damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<p>[In addition, all ranged attacks within 30 feet of the origin point are
made with disadvantage until the start of your next turn.]</p>
<p>Earth.[ Clumps of dirt and stone explode outward. Creatures
within 10 feet of the point you choose must make a Strength saving throw
against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target takes 4d8
bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the target takes
half damage and isn't knocked prone.]</p>
<p>Fire.[ Flames roil outward in a burst of inferno. Creatures
within 15 feet of the  point you choose take 6d6 fire damage, or half
damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw against your spell save
DC.]</p>
<p>Ice.[ You condense and flash freeze the water from a vast
area above you into a massive boulder that drops down with immense
force. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature directly below the
point you choose. On a hit, you deal the target 4d6 bludgeoning damage
and 4d6 cold damage.]</p>
<p>[In addition, the area in a 20-foot radius around the target becomes
difficult terrain for 1 minute.]</p>
<p>Water.[ You create a 20-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide wave that
travels 30 feet in one direction and then crashes down. Any Large or
smaller objects and creatures in the wave's path make a Strength saving
throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target takes 4d8
bludgeoning damage and is carried along with the wave. On a success, the

campaign setting.]</p>
<h3>Inspiring Charge</h3>
<p>[Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to spend 1 exertion and
perform an Inspiring Charge. Move up to your Speed (or your mount's
Speed) in a straight line and make a melee weapon attack. You gain an
expertise die on this attack. Until the end of your next turn, attacks
made by you or allies within 10 feet gain an expertise die.]</p>
<h3>Additional Fighting Style</h3>
<p>[At 10th level, you gain an additional Fighting Style from the following
list: Battle Ready, Defense, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, Mounted
Combatant, Protection, Tireless Fighting.]</p>
<h3>Ever-Ready</h3>
<p>[Starting at 15th level, whenever you roll for initiative and have no
exertion points remaining, you gain a number of exertion points equal to
your proficiency bonus.]</p>
<h3>Knight of Renown</h3>
<p>[At 18th level, the range of your Inspiring Charge increases from 10
feet to 60 feet, and any of your allies that enter that area for the
first time on their turn or begin their turn there gain inspiration. A
creature can gain inspiration in this way only once between long
rests.]</p>
<h2>Sharpshooter</h2>
<h3>Crack Shot</h3>
<p>[Starting at 3rd level, your training with ranged weapons grants the
following benefits:]</p>
<ul>
<li>[You do not have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls due to being
    within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range.]{.c6
    .c7}</li>
<li>[Your ranged weapon attack rolls ignore half cover and
    three-quarters cover.]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharpshooting Traditions</h3>
<p>[Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following combat
traditions of your choice: Biting Zephyr, Razor's Edge, Unending Wheel.
When you gain this feature you can choose one of the maneuvers you know
and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from
your newly chosen combat tradition.]</p>
<h3>Focus Shot</h3>
<p>[At 7th level, once per turn, whenever you take the Attack action and
are able to make multiple ranged attacks, you can forgo one of those
ranged attacks to turn one of your remaining attacks into a Focus Shot.
When you make a Focus Shot, choose one of the following options and make
a ranged weapon attack. You gain an expertise die on the attack, and on
a hit it does your chosen effect in addition to the weapon's
damage.]</p>
<p>Aim for the Eyes.[ You aim for the creature's weak and
delicate eyes. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your
maneuver DC or is blinded until it recovers.]</p>
<p>Bring it Down.[ You aim for weak points on the creature's
legs. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver
DC or its Speed is reduced by half until it recovers.]</p>
<p>Center of Mass.[ You aim for the heart or its horrid
equivalent. Your attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 19--20. If
you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical
hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17--20).]</p>
<p>Vein Slice.[ You aim for a vital vein or artery to bleed
your target out. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against
your maneuver DC or it takes 1d6 ongoing damage until it recovers.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<p>Wing Clip.[ You aim for your target's wings. The target
makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure,
its fly speed is reduced by half until it recovers. A creature that
fails this saving throw while flying immediately falls 60 feet, taking
damage as normal if it strikes a solid surface.]</p>
<p>[A creature wounded by any of these effects makes a Constitution saving
throw against your maneuver DC at the end of each of its turns,
recovering and ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively,
the wounded creature (or a creature within 5 feet of it) can use an
action to make a Medicine check against your maneuver DC, ending the
effect on a success. Healing magically or from a trait (such as
Regeneration) also ends the effect. You can't choose effects that
specifically target body parts a creature doesn't have.]</p>
<h3>Hawkeye</h3>
<p>[At 10th level, you gain an expertise die on Investigation and
Perception checks, and when rolling initiative.]</p>
<h3>Reflexive Shot</h3>
<p>[At 15th level, you can make opportunity attacks using ranged weapons,
and your threatened area is equal to the normal range of any ranged
weapon you wield.]</p>
<h3>Critical Shot</h3>
<p>[At 18th level, whenever you take the Attack action and are able to make
multiple ranged attacks, you can forgo all of those ranged attacks
except for one to turn that remaining attack into a Critical Shot,
making a ranged weapon attack with advantage. If your Critical Shot
hits, it becomes a critical hit.]</p>

<h2>Hit Points</h2>
<p>Hit Dice: 1d10 per herald level</p>
<p>Hit Points at 1st Level: [10 + your Constitution
modifier]</p>
<p>Hit Points at Higher Levels: [1d10 (or 6) + your
Constitution modifier per herald level after 1st]</p>
<h2>Proficiencies</h2>
<p>Armor: [Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor,
shields]</p>
<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
<p>Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma</p>
<p>Skills: [Choose two from Athletics, Acrobatics, History,

<h2>Equipment</h2>

one of the following equipment packages. Also consult the Suggested
Equipment section of your chosen background.]</p>
<ul>

<li>Divine Warrior's Set (Cost 200 gp): [Longsword,
    hauberk, medium shield, explorer's pack]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Divine Sense</h2>
<p>[Choose one of the following sets of creatures: celestials and fiends,
fey and elementals, or aberrations and undead. You can sense when a
creature of one of your chosen types is within 30 feet of you, but you
can't determine their number, type, or location. As a bonus action, you
can focus your senses to learn the location, number, and type of any
creatures of your chosen types within 30 feet of you. When you do so,
creatures of those types that are within range make a Wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC, with advantage if the creature's CR is
higher than your herald level. On a failed save, you also learn the
creature's identity. You also detect any locations within 30 feet that
have been consecrated or desecrated with the ]hallow[ spell
or another effect.]</p>
<p>[You can activate this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum one time), and you regain spent uses when you finish a
long rest. Upon finishing a long rest, you may also swap your chosen set
of creature types for another.]</p>
<h2>Lay on Hands</h2>
<p>[You have a pool of power equal to your herald level × 5 that
replenishes when you finish a long rest. As an action, you can touch a
creature and spend from this pool of power to restore hit points equal
to the number of points you chose to expend. This healing can't bring a
creature above their hit point maximum.]</p>
<p>[Alternatively, you can spend 5 points to touch a creature and cure one
disease or neutralize one poison currently affecting the creature. You
can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single
use of Lay on Hands if you can expend sufficient points.]</p>
<p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>
<h2>Spellcasting</h2>

<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>

of spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your herald level
(minimum of one spell) from the herald spell list. You cannot prepare a
spell of a higher level than your highest level spell slot.</p>
<p>[To cast a herald spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell's
level or higher.The Herald Spells table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your herald spells. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.]</p>

spells.You can change the spells you have prepared by spending at least
1 minute per spell level reflecting in meditation.]</p>
<h2>Spellcasting Ability</h2>
<p>[Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your herald spells. You use
your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier to set the attack bonus and
saving throw DC for your herald spells, as follows:]</p>
<p>Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier]</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your

proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Sanguine
Knot, Spirited Steed, or Tempered Iron. You learn two maneuvers of your
choice from traditions you are proficient with.]</p>
<p>[You use your maneuvers by spending exertion points, but you do not gain
an exertion pool. Instead, at the start of each of your turns you can
expend spell slots of 1st-level or higher to gain exertion points that
go into a temporary exertion pool which lasts until you start your next
long rest. You gain 2 exertion points for a 1st-level spell slot, and 2
more for each spell slot level above 1st. Only spell slots gained from
the herald class can be expended in this way.]</p>
<p>[The Maneuvers Known column of the Herald table shows when you learn
more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the
Maneuver Degree column shows the highest-degree maneuver you can select
at a given level.]</p>
<p>[Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
degree from a tradition you are proficient with.]</p>
<h2>Divine Smite</h2>
<p>Starting at 2nd level,  whenever you hit a creature with a weapon
attack, you can choose to deliver a divine smite that deals an extra 1d8
radiant damage.The amount of extra damage increases at higher levels, as

<p>[You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, and you regain spent uses when you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h2>Divine Lessons</h2>
<p>[At 3rd level, you gain a divine lesson of your choice. The divine
lessons available to you are detailed at the end of the class
description. The Lessons Known column of the Herald table shows when you
learn more divine lessons.]</p>
<h2>Herald Archetype</h2>
<p>[Also at 3rd level, you choose the oath and tenets that you as a herald

school when preparing your herald spells. If you would choose a spell
that is not on the herald spell list, it is considered a herald spell
for you.]</p>
<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
<p>[When you choose an archetype, you gain the ability to Channel Divinity
once per rest. When you use this feature, you choose which option to
use. Each Channel Divinity option granted by your archetype explains how
to use it. Some Channel Divinity options require your target to make a
saving throw. In such a case, use your herald spell save DC.]</p>
<h2>Empowered Smite</h2>
<p>[At 4th level, you can manipulate magic to add extra power to your
smites. Whenever you would use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose
one of the following effects. Once you have used this feature, you can't
do so again until you finish a long rest. Alternatively, you can empower

action or by the environment, and it burns out naturally after 1
minute.]</p>
<h3>Marking Smite</h3>

light for an additional 5 feet. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until

<h3>Lend Faith</h3>
<p>[When an ally within 30 feet that can see and hear you would make an
ability check or saving throw, you can inspire them with your faith,
adding your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) to the roll. Once you have
used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a rest.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h3>Reveal Heresy</h3>

Channel Divinity options.]</p>
<p>Blessing of Nature.[ For the next hour, you have advantage
on Persuasion checks made to influence druids and beasts. Alternatively,
you can end the blessing early to gain advantage on a Survival check
made to find Supply or a haven in the wilderness.]</p>
<p>Rely on Nature. [When you fail a Nature or Survival check,
you can use your reaction to succeed instead.]</p>
<h3>Empowered Bond</h3>

your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own
with its reaction.]</p>
<h3>Nature's Sanctuary</h3>
<p>[At 7th level, when a beast or plant attacks you, it must make a Wisdom
saving throw against your herald spell save DC. The beast or plant has
advantage on this saving throw if it has a CR equal to or higher than
your herald level. On a failed save, the creature must choose a
different target or the attack automatically misses. On a successful
save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. A creature is
aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.]</p>
<p>[In addition, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or
fey.]</p>
<h3>Armaments of Nature</h3>
<p>[Starting at 15th level, you can use an action and expend one use of
Channel Divinity to cover yourself in bark, rock, soil, and vines for 1
hour.]</p>
<p>[For the duration, your Armor Class equals 10 + your proficiency bonus +
your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, and when a creature
grappling you starts its turn, it takes 2d6 piercing damage.]</p>
<p>[In addition, you can use a bonus action to grow a melee weapon in your
hands. You are proficient with the weapon and it deals 1d12 bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the weapon's shape). While
wielding the weapon, your reach increases by 5 feet. The weapon can't be
disarmed, but it can be damaged (AC equal to your herald spell save DC
and hit points equal to your herald level).]</p>
<h3>Timeless Body</h3>
<p>[Also at 15th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age
more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
year.]</p>
<h3>Nature's Servant</h3>
<p>[At 20th level, if you start your turn bloodied, you regain hit points
equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. While your Armaments of Nature
feature is active, the amount of hit points you regain doubles, and you
regain hit points even when you aren't blooded. You don't gain these
benefits while you have 0 hit points.]</p>
<p>[In addition, the weapon you form using Armaments of Nature is
considered magical and grants you a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls

Channel Divinity options.]</p>

Channel Divinity to unleash a flood of negative energy on your foes.
Creatures you choose within 30 feet of you make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage and is
pushed back 5 feet. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't pushed
back.]</p>
<p>Positive Energy Flood. [As a bonus action, you can use your
Channel Divinity to send out a flood of positive energy to heal your
allies. Creatures you choose (including yourself) within 30 feet regain
hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier.]</p>
<h3>Aura of the Champion</h3>
<p>[Beginning at 7th level, you gain a third aura that is active alongside
your Sacred Aura and has the same range. Choose one of the following
options.]</p>
<p>Aura of Darkness. [After initiative is rolled, when a
hostile creature starts its turn in your aura or first enters into it on
a turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of
you for 1 minute. Once a creature has been frightened by this aura, it
is immune to the aura's effects for 24 hours.]</p>
<p>Aura of Light. [An unconscious ally with 0 hit points that
starts its turn in your aura automatically succeeds on the first death
saving throw it makes that turn. Once a creature succeeds on three death
saving throws while in your aura, it can't benefit from this effect
again until it finishes a long rest.]</p>
<h3>Divine Protection</h3>
<p>[Starting at 15th level,when you are bloodied at the end of your turn,
you regain hit points equal to half your herald level + your Charisma
modifier.]</p>
<h3>Champion of Legend</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you gain one of the following benefits.</p>
<p>Emissary of Darkness. [You gain the Evil alignment trait.
You can use an action to call upon your deity and emit an aura of
magical darkness. For 1 minute, magical darkness fills the area around
you in a 30-foot radius. You and a number of creatures you choose equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum one create) can see in this darkness
as if it were dim light. When a hostile creature starts its turn in your
aura or first enters your aura on a turn, it takes necrotic damage equal
to 10 + your Charisma modifier.]</p>
<p>Emissary of Light. [You gain the Good alignment trait. You
can use an action to call upon your deity and emit an aura of sunlight.
For 1 minute, you shine bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light
for an additional 30 feet. When a hostile creature starts its turn in
your aura or first enters your aura on a turn, it takes radiant damage

    you carry out divine retribution.]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Archetype School</h3>
<p>[Add the communication school of magic to your list of herald
spells.]</p>
<h3>Channel Divinity</h3>
<p>[At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
Channel Divinity options.]</p>
<p>Compelling Inquiry. [When questioning a creature with which
you share a language, you can use your Channel Divinity to compel it to
speak the truth. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw or finds
itself unable to be dishonest for 1 minute. Regardless of whether it
succeeds or fails, you know the outcome of the saving throw.]</p>
<p>Inquisitorial Challenge. [As a bonus action, you can use
your Channel Divinity to issue a challenge of combat to one creature you
can see within 30 feet. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature can't move more than 30 feet away from you and
has disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than you for 1
minute.]</p>
<h3>Mark of the Heretic</h3>
<p>[Beginning at 7th level, you can use a bonus action to choose one
creature you can see within 30 feet. The target is marked for 1 minute,
or until either you or the target die. While the target is marked, you
gain the following benefits:]</p>
<ul>
<li>[Damage rolls you make against the creature deal extra damage equal
    to your spell attack modifier.]</li>
<li>[Attacks made by you or your allies score critical hits against the
    creature on a roll of 19--20.]</li>
<li>[The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or it becomes outlined
    in a nimbus of light (of a color chosen by you) for the duration.
    This nimbus of light negates the benefits of invisibility on the
    creature.]</li>
</ul>
<p>[If the marked target isn't killed or captured within 1 hour, you have
disadvantage on melee weapon attacks against other creatures until you
finish a rest.]</p>
<p>[Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish
a rest. At 15th level, you can use this feature twice between
rests.]</p>
<h3>Divine Justice</h3>
<p>[Starting at 15th level, when you use Mark of the Heretic, you need only
point at a creature to mark it. Additionally, when a creature marked by
this feature dies, you can apply the mark to another creature you can
see within 30 feet without expending another use of Mark of the
Heretic.]</p>
<h3>Ear for Deceit</h3>
<p>[At 20th level, when listening to a creature speak, provided you share
at least one language, you are immediately aware if it is being
dishonest---though you have no special ability to obtain the truth
without using your Channel Divinity. Creatures protected from
divination, such as by the ]nondetection [spell, are immune
to this feature.]</p>

<p>[When you take the Attack action, you can forgo making one attack to

<p>[In addition, when a creature makes an attack granted by your Commanding
Presence, it can simultaneously use one Sanguine Knot combat maneuver
that you know. If the creature does not have any exertion points to
spend on combat maneuvers, it does not require exertion points for that
use but it can't benefit from Combat Directives again until it finishes
a rest.]</p>

Intimidation checks.]</p>
<h3>Maverick</h3>

<p>At 15th level, choose one of the following.</p>
<h4>More Tactical</h4>
<p>[Whenever you gain a tactics die, you gain an additional tactics die, to
a maximum of two dice. The second tactics die can be used like the first
and increases size in the manner described under the Tactical Edge class
feature.]</p>
<h4>Tactical Efficacy</h4>
<p>[Your tactics die begins at d6. When you reach 20th level, your tactics
die begins at d8. After the tactics die is rolled, when regained it
reverts to a d4.]</p>
<h3>Hidden Resources</h3>
<p>At 18th level, choose one of the following.</p>
<h4>Dig Deeper</h4>
<p>[You can use a bonus action on your turn to allow a creature to regain
the use of an origin trait or class feature that would normally be
regained by finishing a short rest. You can use this feature twice, and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h4>Reach Further</h4>
<p>[While you are conscious, when a creature you choose within the radius
of your Commanding Presence would drop to 0 hit points, that creature
can use its reaction to roll your tactics die and gain temporary hit
points equal to the result plus your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Once
a creature has benefited from your tactics die in this way, it can't do
so again until it finishes a long rest.]</p>

<p>Wilderness Guardian Template</p>
<p>[A wilderness guardian keeps the statistics of its base creature, except
as follows:]</p>
<p>Armor Class. [The guardian's Armor Class increases by
2.]</p>
<p>Challenge. [The guardian's challenge rating increases to CR
7.]</p>
<p>Languages.[ The guardian speaks Primordial, in addition to
any other languages it knows.]</p>
<p>New Trait: Primal Force. [The guardian gains +1 bonus to
attack rolls with its weapon attacks and deals an extra 5 force damage
on a hit.]</p>
<p>Multiattack.[ If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller
target, the target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the guardian uses its
Engulf on it.]</p>
<p>New Action: Engulf. [The guardian engulfs a Medium or
smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed creature is blinded,
restrained, can't breathe, and at the start of each of the guardian's
turns it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 +
4 bludgeoning damage (or fire damage for a fire guardian). If the
guardian moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. The guardian can
have only one creature engulfed at a time.]</p>
<p>New Action: Guard Life. [The guardian uses its Engulf on a
willing or unconscious ally without dealing damage. While engulfed, the
ally is grappled but not restrained, can see and breathe normally, and
has total cover. As soon as the ally takes an action, reaction, or bonus
action, they are no longer engulfed. The guardian can release the ally
at will (no action required).]</p>
<h3>Summon Stampede</h3>
<p>[Once per long rest, you can use an action to make all beasts within a
1-mile radius friendly to you for 1 minute. Alternatively, for 1 minute
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), you can choose one of
the following effects. You can't choose the same effect two rounds in a
row. ]</p>
<p>Enraged Fauna.[ Up to three Huge native creatures of CR 8
or lower charge forward, bowling into your enemies. Choose any number of
creatures you can see within 100 feet. Each creature makes a Strength
saving throw against your maneuver DC, taking 6d8 bludgeoning damage on
a failure, or half damage on a success.]</p>
<p>[In addition, you can choose one of the Huge creatures to stay and
fight. Only one such creature can assist in this way at a time, and the
creature retreats when bloodied or when you command it to leave.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<p>Rushing Stampede.[ A Huge-sized horde of Small, Medium, and
Large native creatures hurry through the area, traveling in a straight,
30-foot-wide line from a point you choose. Until the start of your next
turn, the area is difficult terrain. In addition, each creature you
chose in the area when you summon the stampede makes a Dexterity saving
throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6
bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is stunned until the start of
your next turn. On a success, the creature instead takes half damage and
is rattled until the start of your next turn.]</p>
<p>Swarming Pests.[ Several Medium-sized swarms of Tiny native
creatures enter the spaces of up to five Small, Medium, or Large
creatures you choose, or the space of one Huge or Gargantuan creature.
Each creature you choose when you summon the swarms makes a Constitution
saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed save, a creature
loses concentration on any spell or effect it is concentrating on and is
blinded and slowed until the start of your next turn. On a success, the
creature is instead slowed until the start of your next turn.]</p>
<h1>Exploration Knacks</h1>
<p>[When you gain access to a new exploration knack, choose one of the
following.]</p>
<h2>Beast Friend</h2>
<p>[If you spend 10 minutes befriending and feeding a Medium or smaller
beast of CR 1/8 or less, you become its guardian ranger. It follows you
and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its
own initiative and acts on its own turn. The beast won't attack except
as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal
and makes death saving throws. You can be a guardian ranger to only one
beast at a time.]</p>
<h2>Build Shelter</h2>
<p>[You can spend 8 hours building a basic shelter that protects up to
eight Medium or smaller creatures from the elements and reduces the
likelihood of attack from monsters and bandits. The shelter counts as a
haven. It lasts for as long as it is needed but falls apart permanently
after being left for a month unattended.]</p>
<p>[Once you have used this knack, you can't do so again for 7 days.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h2>Calls of the Wild</h2>
<p>[Using verbal and nonverbal cues to communicate with beasts, you can
gain basic information from them or make a simple request (like
delivering a short message or small object).]</p>
<h2>Ear to the Ground</h2>
<p>[If you spend 1 minute without moving, you can deduce information about
your environment in a 30-foot radius, as if using blindsight or
tremorsense. The effect ends if you move or take an action.]</p>
<h2>Expert Foraging</h2>
<p>[Once between long rests, you can spend 1 minute to collect a number of
edible, non-poisonous plants and grubs equal to your proficiency bonus.
A creature can use its action to eat up to five plants or grubs, each of
which restores 1 hit point and constitutes 1 Supply. The plants and
grubs spoil 1 hour after being collected.]</p>
<h2>Forced Marcher</h2>
<p>[You can travel an additional number of hours equal to your proficiency
bonus before needing to make a Constitution saving throw for a forced
march.]</p>
<h2>Guide</h2>
<p>[While traveling, when you would roll a failure or critical failure for
a Scout journey activity, you can choose to succeed instead. In
addition, you can Scout while engaged in any other journey
activity.]</p>
<h2>Healing Salves</h2>
<p>[Once between long rests, you can spend an hour collecting natural
ingredients and concoct an ointment that speeds healing. This salve is
potent for 24 hours and has a number of uses equal to 1 + your Wisdom
modifier. As an action, you can use the salve to restore 1d4 hit points
to a creature within reach.]</p>
<h2>Herbal Bitters</h2>
<p>[You can spend an hour to collect ingredients and brew two servings of a
bitter drink that is potent for 24 hours. Imbibing a serving requires an
action and reduces fatigue by one level for 4 hours.]</p>
<h2>Huntsman</h2>
<p>[When you use the Hunt and Gather journey activity, you gain advantage
on your Survival checks.]</p>
<h2>Longwalker</h2>
<p>[When you would gain a level of fatigue due to lack of Supply during a
journey, you don't gain that level of fatigue. Alternatively, you can
choose to accept the level of fatigue, allowing up to two traveling
companions to forgo gaining a level of fatigue instead. Once you have
used this feature, you can't do so again for 7 days.]</p>
<h2>Master Tracker</h2>
<p>Prerequisite: 9th level</p>
<p>[Once between long rests, while outdoors you can spend 5 minutes
scouring the ground in a 30-foot-diameter area for clues. You learn all
events that transpired in the area in the last 24 hours as though you
had witnessed them yourself, although you don't learn secret information
not obvious to an observer. The information you gain is only that which
would be learned by sight.]</p>
<h2>Monster Mimic</h2>
<p>[By imitating how a beast or one of your studied adversaries sounds,
looks, and moves, you can gain advantage on Deception and Intimidation
checks made to convince a creature that it is seeing or hearing that
beast or studied adversary.]</p>
<h2>Poisons and Antidotes</h2>
<p>[Once between long rests, you can spend 1 hour searching your
environment and make a DC 10 Survival check. On a success, you collect
poisonous plants. You can spend 10 minutes to extract three doses of
liquid poison from the plants. A creature that ingests a dose of the
poison makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or is poisoned for 1
hour. Alternatively, you can spend 1 hour to create one dose of
antitoxin.]</p>
<h2>Read the Room</h2>
<p>[By spending 10 minutes observing facial expressions, body language, and
vocal intonation, you can detect minute details that give you insight
into the nature of creatures within 30 feet of you. For the next minute,
you can direct your focus on any one creature you can see within 30
feet.You learn the surface thoughts of the creature---what is most on
its mind in that moment. As an action, you can shift your attention to
another creature's thoughts. Creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or
lower or that doesn't speak a language can't be studied in this
way.]</p>
<h2>Relentless Pursuit</h2>
<p>[Once you have successfully picked up the tracks of a creature, you can
follow those tracks without any need for further checks for a period of
up to 7 days.]</p>
<h2>See the Unseen</h2>
<p>Prerequisite: 5th level</p>
<p>[Once between long rests, you can focus your attention on peripheral
sights, sounds, and other signs of unseen passage. For the next hour,
you can detect invisible creatures and objects, their location,
movement, and actions, and even sense creatures and objects in the
Ethereal Plane.]</p>
<h2>Survivalist</h2>
<p>[When traveling, you can undertake two journey activities instead of
one. Both activities must be from the following list: Befriend Animal,
Harvest, Hunt and Gather, Scout.]</p>

these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. ]{.c6

<p>Additionally, when you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace a sorcerer
spell you know with another from the sorcerer spell list, provided it is

<h2>Manifestation</h2>
<p>[Also at 2nd level, choose one of the following manifestations. When you
cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder
damage, you can change the damage type to your manifestation's damage
type.]</p>
<h3>Blizzard (Cold)</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes cold
damage from the spell, it is also chilled, reducing its movement speeds
by 10 feet for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level (minimum 1
round).]</p>
<h3>Corrosion (Acid)</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell that deals acid damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes acid
damage from the spell, its Armor Class is reduced by 2 until the end of
your next turn.]</p>
<h3>Hurricane (Lightning or Thunder)</h3>
<p>[You can treat both lightning and thunder as your manifestation's damage
types. When you cast a spell that deals lightning or thunder damage, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to produce a thunderous blast around you.
Large or smaller creatures within 5 feet of you make a Strength saving
throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is
pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.]</p>
<h3>Inferno (Fire)</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes fire
damage from the spell, it is also set ablaze, taking 2d4 ongoing fire
damage for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, or until it
uses an action to put itself out.]</p>
<h3>Venom (Poison)</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell that deals poison damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point. If you do, creatures immune to poison damage take half damage
from the spell, and creatures resistant to poison damage take full
damage.]</p>
<h2>Latent Power</h2>
<p>At 3rd level, choose one of the following.</p>
<h3>All Eyes</h3>
<p>[You gain an expertise die on Performance and Persuasion checks. In
addition, as a bonus action you can spend 1 sorcery point to put out a
subtle pulse that causes all creatures within 60 feet to take notice of
you, allowing you to speak and be heard even in the midst of chaos.
During combat, this notice lasts only a split second---not long enough
to distract, but allowing you to make a Charisma check as part of the
bonus action used to activate this feature.]</p>
<h3>Daunting Energy</h3>
<p>[You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. If you fail an
ability check or saving throw against a creature trying to intimidate
you, or against an effect that would cause you to become frightened, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the check or save. If you do, you
must use the new result.]</p>
<h3>Unsuspecting</h3>
<p>[You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When you fail a
Deception check against a humanoid, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
reroll the check. On a success, their memory skips a beat and fills in
the gap with your new story. On a failure, not only do they not believe
you, but anyone who can cast spells and observed the exchange (including
your target, if applicable) recognizes your attempt at arcane
subterfuge.]</p>
<h2>Metamagic</h2>
<p>[At 3rd level, you gain two minor Metamagic options, and one moderate
Metamagic option. You gain another minor Metamagic option at 5th level,
10th level, 15th level, and 19th level. You gain an additional moderate
Metamagic option at 10th and 19th level. When you gain a level in this
class, you can replace one Metamagic option with another of the same
degree, instead of replacing a spell.]</p>
<p>[You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,
unless otherwise noted.]</p>
<h3>Minor Metamagic</h3>
<p>Delayed Spell.[ When you ready a spell, you can spend 1
sorcery point. The spell can be held for up to 1 minute, instead of
until the start of your next turn.]</p>
<p>Distant Spell[. When you cast a spell that has a range
listed in feet, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of a
spell. If you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1
sorcery point to make the range of the spell 20 feet.]</p>
<p>Persistent Spell[. When you cast a spell that has a
duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double
the duration, to a maximum of 24 hours.]</p>
<p>Reliable Spell.[ When you roll a 4 or lower on
a spell attack, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the attack. If
you do, you must use the new result. You can use Reliable Spell even if
you have already used a different Metamagic option on the spell.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<p>Subdual Spell[. When damage from one of your spells reduces
one or more creatures to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and
spend 1 sorcery point to stabilize one of the creatures knocked
unconscious by it.]</p>
<p>Subtle Spell.[ You can spend 1 sorcery point to
cast a spell without vocalized or seen components.]</p>
<p>Treacherous Spell.[ When you cast a spell, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to alter its components in subtle ways. A
creature attempting to identify the spell based on its components
perceives it as a different spell of your choice of the same or lower
level. Attempts to interrupt this spell via
]counterspell are made at disadvantage.</p>
<h3>Moderate Metamagic</h3>
<p>Careful Spell.[ When you cast a spell with an
Iinstantaneous duration that affects an area, you can spend 1 sorcery
point. If you do, choose a number of creatures in the area up to your
Charisma modifier (minimum one creature). Creatures you choose are
unaffected by the spell.]</p>
<p>Empowered Spell.[ When you roll a spell's damage, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of one).  If you do, you must use the new
rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a
different Metamagic option on the spell.]</p>
<p>Heightened Spell.[ When a creature makes a saving throw to
avoid or resist the effects of a spell you cast, you can spend 3 sorcery
points to give that target disadvantage on its initial saving throw
against the spell.]</p>
<p>Quickened Spell.[ When you cast a spell with a casting time
of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast it as a bonus action
instead.]</p>
<p>Reflexive Spell.[ Immediately before rolling initiative,
you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast a spell of up to 3rd-level that
has a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action. The spell activates
before any other actions in initiative, but doing so uses your action
for your first turn in the combat.]</p>
<p>Refracting Spell.[ When you cast a spell that involves a
spell attack roll and targets only a single creature, you can spend an
additional 2 sorcery points. If the spell hits, a creature within 5 feet
of the original target takes half the spell's damage.]</p>
<p>Twinned Spell. [When you target a
creature with a spell that can target only one creature at the level it
is cast and doesn't have a range of Self, you can spend a number of
sorcery points equal to the spell's level (minimum 1) to target a second
creature within range with the same spell.]</p>
<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
<p>[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]</p>
<h2>Arcane Innovations</h2>
<p>[At 4th level, you gain an arcane innovation of your choice. Your arcane
innovations are detailed at the end of the class description. The
Innovations Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you gain
additional innovations.]</p>
<h2>Arcane Refinement</h2>
<p>At 6th level, choose one of the following.</p>
<h3>Deep Source</h3>
<p>[When you finish a short rest, you can expend a number of Hit Dice up to
your Charisma modifier to regain some of your magic essence. For each
Hit Die you expend, you regain 2 sorcery points. Once you have used this
feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h3>Patient Aptitude</h3>
<p>[Choose a number of spells with the ritual tag equal to your Charisma
modifier. These spells need not be from the sorcerer spell list, but
they must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can cast
these spells as rituals, though you don't gain the ability to cast them
normally with spell slots. The spells don't count toward your spells
known. If you increase your Charisma modifier, the number of ritual
spells you know also increases. Each time you gain a sorcerer level, you
can replace one of these ritual spells with another eligible spell.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h3>Prodigious Innovator</h3>
<p>[You learn three cantrips from any spell list. These cantrips don't
count toward your cantrips known.]</p>
<h2>Rapturous Presence</h2>
<p>At 9th level, choose one of the following.</p>
<h3>Larger Than Life</h3>
<p>[You have advantage on Intimidation checks made to threaten someone with
your magic. On a failure, your target is unconvinced, and unless you
make good on your threat, this feature no longer functions until you
prove your reputation again. Additionally, features and traits that
attempt to evaluate how tough you are, such as the fighter's Size Up,
always give the impression that you are more dangerous than you actually
are.]</p>
<h3>Nobody's Fool</h3>
<p>[You gain a bonus to Insight checks equal to your Charisma modifier. In
addition, you can spend 1 sorcery point as an action to project a
magical aura of honesty. For the next 10 minutes, creatures within 10
feet of you have disadvantage on Deception checks made to lie or conceal
the truth. When a creature in this aura fails a Deception check, it
accidentally blurts out something it didn't mean to while attempting to
spin its lie.]</p>
<h3>Otherworldly</h3>
<p>[Select three of the following creature types: aberration, celestial,
dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead. You have advantage on Charisma
checks to make a first impression on a creature of one of your chosen
types, and if you do not share a common language, you can still
communicate some simple concepts to them such as "friendly," "help," and
"run." In addition, by spending 2 sorcery points and 1 minute in
meditation, you can change your creature type to one of the chosen
creature types. This transformation lasts for 1 hour or until you repeat
the meditation and spend 2 sorcery points to reverse it.]</p>
<h2>Evolving Manifestation</h2>
<p>[At 12th level, you gain the improved form of the manifestation you
selected at 2nd level. Alternatively, you can choose an additional
manifestation from the Manifestation list.]</p>
<h3>Evolving Blizzard</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals cold damage,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain 1d6 temporary hit points per level
of the spell. While you have these temporary hit points, whenever a
creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, that creature takes 1d10
cold damage. The temporary hit points last 1 hour.]</p>
<h3>Evolving Corrosion</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals acid damage,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to create a 10-foot-radius pool of acid
centered on either the target of the spell or the spell's point of
origin. The area becomes difficult terrain, and whenever a creature ends
its turn in the area, it takes 2d8 acid damage. The pool remains for 1
minute or until you use a bonus action to dismiss it.]</p>
<h3>Evolving Hurricane</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals lightning or
thunder damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to create a 15-foot-radius
storm centered on you. The storm moves with you when you move. The area
of the storm is heavily obscured and counts as difficult terrain, but
you can see and move through it normally. At the end of each of your
subsequent turns, you can spend an additional sorcery point to maintain
the storm. Otherwise, it dissipates.]</p>
<h3>Evolving Inferno</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals fire damage,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to store some of the spell's energy as a
flame you hold in one hand. You can use an action to throw this flame,
making a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 30
feet. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage per level of the
spell you cast to trigger this effect. The flame lasts for up to 1
minute or until it is thrown.]</p>
<h3>Evolving Venom</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell that deals poison damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes poison
damage from the spell, it takes 2d6 ongoing poison damage for 1 minute
or until a creature uses an action to treat the poison by making a
Medicine check against your spell save DC.]</p>
<h2>Major Metamagic</h2>
<p>[At 15th level, in addition to a minor metamagic option, you gain one
major metamagic option. You gain an additional major metamagic option at
20th level.]</p>
<h3>Major Metamagic Options</h3>
<p>Consumptive Spell. [When you cast a spell that deals
damage, you can spend 4 sorcery points. You or a creature you can see
within 10 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the spell's
damage roll. If you roll the spell's damage multiple times, you only
restore hit points from the first roll.]</p>
<p>Contingent Spell. [When you cast a
spell, rather than have it go off immediately, you can spend 6 sorcery
points and describe an external condition. If that condition occurs
before you finish a long rest, you can use your reaction to trigger the
spell. You can have only one Contingent Spell at a time.]</p>
<p>Echo Spell. [When you cast a spell of
5th-level or lower, you can spend sorcery points equal to the sorcery
point conversion cost for a spell slot of that level (see Table:
Creating Spell Slots). The spell repeats on the next turn, originating
from the same point and aimed at the same target as the first instance
of the spell.]</p>
<p>Intense Spell.[ When you cast a spell that
deals damage, before rolling damage or determining the result of any of
the spell's attack rolls or saving throws, you can spend sorcery points
equal to the spell's level. If you do, the spell deals its maximum
possible damage to one target.]</p>
<h2>Arcane Clutch</h2>
<p>[Starting at 20th level, you can reclaim some fraction of the energies
you expend as you cast. Whenever you cast a spell of 3rd-level or
higher, you regain sorcery points equal to one-third of the expended
spell slot's level.]</p>
<h2>Explosive Magics</h2>
<p>[Also at 20th level, the magic you bring to bear can be made to build
upon itself. When you cast a spell of 4th-level or lower that deals
damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to half the
spell's level (minimum 1) to reroll any dice that have the maximum
result and add them to the total. For example, if you cast an exploding
]fireball[ and roll three 6s among your damage dice, you
roll an additional 3d6 and continue rerolling any 6s, adding them to the
total damage dealt.]</p>
<h1>Arcane Innovations</h1>
<p>[When you gain access to a new arcane innovation, choose one of the
following.]</p>
<h2>Draw Nourishment</h2>
<p>[You can spend 3 sorcery points before eating a pound of just about
anything organic---bark, grass, cactus flesh, bone, whatever's at
hand---and so long as you can stomach the taste, it counts as 1 Supply
for you as your body transmutes it into something more edible. A
poisonous substance consumed in this way is still poisonous.]</p>
<h2>Hot Air</h2>
<p>[Any time you have sorcery points remaining, your weight is reduced by
half, and you take half damage from falling. Additionally, if you are
carrying less than a quarter of your maximum equipment load, you float
on water.]</p>
<h2>Lingering Touch</h2>
<p>[When you encounter a shed piece of a creature (such as a lock of hair,
a bloody bandage, a scale, or a tooth), you can touch that object and
instantly attune to it as if it were a magic item. While you are attuned
to the object, when you see the creature from which it originated, you
immediately know that it belongs to that creature, at which point the
attunement ends. At the Narrator's discretion, you might learn
additional cryptic information as a result of being attuned to such
things.]</p>
<h2>Mage Hunter</h2>
<p>[When tracking a creature that can cast at least one spell, you can
focus on the mystic energy it leaves in its wake, allowing you to use
your Charisma for any ability checks made to track it.]</p>
<h2>Magnetic Step</h2>
<p>[You can move along vertical surfaces at half your Sspeed without
needing to make an ability check. If you end your turn on such a
surface, you immediately fall unless you have some other way to support
yourself.]</p>
<h2>Retrace</h2>
<p>[By spending 1 minute in meditation, you can reflect on the magical aura
you leave behind as you travel. After doing so, you can perfectly
retrace the steps you've taken in the past 4 hours.]</p>
<h2>Strange Traces</h2>
<p>[While traveling, you can spend 1 sorcery point to obscure your trail.
For the next hour, any tracks your group leaves become random,
zigzagging, and incomprehensible. Creatures have disadvantage on
Survival checks to track you and become lost on a failed check.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h2>Ominous Insight</h2>
<p>[When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, you can
draw on your magics to find an answer and reroll the check. On a
failure, your attempt clouds your mind and you have disadvantage on
Intelligence checks until you finish a rest. While your mind remains
clouded, you can't use Ominous Insight again.]</p>
<h2>Wode Sense</h2>
<p>[While traveling, any time you enter illusory terrain or magic causes
you to become lost, you notice within 1 minute of being affected.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h1>Sorcerer Archetypes</h1>
<h2>Sorcerer Archetype Spells</h2>
<p>[You know additional spells from your sorcerer archetype. At 1st level,
choose one spell from the 1st-level row of your archetype's Archetype
Spells table and add it to your spell list. It does not count against
your total spells known. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, choose an
additional spell from a row on the table equal to or lower than your
sorcerer level. When you gain a level, you can replace one of your
archetype spells with an archetype spell of equal or lower level.]{.c6

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+</p>
<h3>Draconic Toughness</h3>
<p>[At 1st level when you choose this archetype, your hit point maximum
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain a sorcerer
level. Also, when you are unarmored, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity
modifier. ]</p>
<h3>Voice of the Dragon</h3>
<p>[Also at 1st level, you understand the language of dragons. You can
speak, sign, read, and write Draconic. You have advantage on Charisma
checks made to influence the behavior of dragons, so long as you
converse with them in their native tongue.]</p>
<h3>Lord Among Beasts and Mortals</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, when you start a rest in an area that isn't
within 1 mile of an established settlement, you can spend 10 minutes in
communion with the land to protect your camp until you finish your rest.
Beasts who approach within 100 feet of your camp become docile and
placid, refusing to attack you or your companions. Additionally,
friendly creatures in your camp gain advantage on Perception checks to
spot danger, as well as on Intimidation checks against intruders.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<p>[If you repeat this effect every day in the same location for a year,
the radius of the effect increases to 500 feet, and the effect becomes
permanent. When you have a permanent lair, your Prestige increases by an
amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. You can have only one
permanent lair at a time, and the effect fades if you are ever away from
your lair for a year or longer. If you die, the effect fades after 2d10
days.]</p>
<h3>Soaring Wings</h3>
<p>[Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to sprout dragon
wings. The wings grant you a flying speed equal to your Speed. You can
dismiss these wings as a bonus action. You can't manifest the wings
while wearing armor, unless the armor has been specially modified for
that purpose (increasing its cost by 50 percent). The wings tear
clothing that is not similarly modified.]</p>
<h3>Draconic Presence</h3>
<p>[Starting at 18th level, you can use an action and spend 5 sorcery
points to exude a 60-foot aura of your choice of awe or fear. For 1
minute, when a hostile creature starts its turn in this aura it makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it becomes charmed (in an awe aura)
or frightened (in a fear aura) until the aura ends. The creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving
throw is immune to your Draconic Presence for 24 hours.]</p>

<h3>Deeper Understanding</h3>
<p>[Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, you gain an
expertise die on ability checks made to identify spells being cast or
sense the presence of lingering magic in any form.]</p>
<h3>Reach Beyond</h3>
<p>[Also at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to attempt to replace one
of your archetype spells. Declare which spell you're trying to replace
and make a Charisma saving throw (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a
success, you replace the spell with another archetype spell of the same
or lower level until you finish a long rest, at which point the original
spell returns to your spell list. This newly gained spell can't be
replaced again.]</p>
<p>[On a failure, the new spell isn't added to your spell list, and you
inadvertently cast the spell you're attempting to replace, expending no
spell slots but targeting a creature or point within range of the
Narrator's choice (possibly yourself). The spell is too wild to alter
with metamagic, and if it requires concentration it instead lasts its
full duration with no concentration required. The archetype spell you
attempted to replace is then removed from your spell list until you
finish a long rest, at which point it returns.]</p>
<h3>Retributive Surge</h3>
<p>[At 6th level, when a creature you can see damages you, you can use your
reaction to cast a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. The spell must either target
the creature that damaged you or be centered on a space it occupies. The
spell must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, and you
must spend sorcery points equal to the spell's level, in addition to the
spell slot you used to cast the spell.]</p>
<p>[At 14th and 18th level, the highest level of spell you can cast in this
way increases by 1.]</p>
<h3>Tenuous Serenity</h3>
<p>[At 14th level, when you make a Charisma saving throw, you can spend 1
sorcery point to add an expertise die to the roll, or to reroll an
expertise die used in the roll. You can do so after seeing the result of
the saving throw.]</p>
<p>[Additionally, when you finish a short rest, select a spell that's been
removed from your spell list by one of your class features. You reclaim
the spell. Once you've used this feature to reclaim a lost spell, you
can't do so again until you finish a long rest.]</p>
<h3>Erupting Nova</h3>
<p>[At 18th level, you can cast two spells simultaneously, expending spell
slots for each, so long as both spells have a casting time of 1 action,
the sum of their levels is less than 6, and neither spell requires
concentration. When you do so, make a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the
sum of the spells' levels). On a failure, you waste your action (but not
any spell slots) and both spells are removed from your spell list until
you finish a long rest.]</p>

<p>[In addition, you can use Charisma when making an ability check to
navigate, survive in, or remember information about planes of existence
other than the Material Plane.]</p>
<h3>Flutter</h3>
<p>[Also at 1st level, after you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you
can teleport a short distance to an unoccupied space you can see. The
maximum range of this teleportation is equal to 5 feet + 5 feet per
level of the spell.]</p>
<h3>Gift of Impermanence</h3>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, once per round when you fail a saving throw
against an effect that would cause you to become grappled,
incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, or stunned, you can
spend 1 sorcery point, and reroll one d20 used in the saving throw.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h3>All Terrains</h3>
<p>At 14th level, choose one of the following boons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You ignore difficult terrain.</li>
<li>[You ignore the effects of extreme heat, extreme cold, and high
    altitude.]</li>
<li>You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed.</li>
<li>[You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on
    ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.]</li>
<li>[You can spend 1 sorcery point to gain a fly speed equal to your
    Speed for 1 hour.]</li>

<p>[When you finish a long rest, you can replace your active boon with a
different boon from this list.]</p>
<h3>Touch the Void</h3>
<p>[At 18th level, you can spend 1 hour in meditation to cast
]astral projection, dream, or etherealness[.
Each of these spells is slightly different when cast using this feature,
as described below:]</p>
<p>Astral Projection.[ The spell requires no material
components, but it only affects you.]</p>
<p>Dream.[ You are the messenger in the dream, and while you
are influencing the dream you are unaware of your surroundings.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<p>Etherealness.[ When the spell ends, you reappear in the
space you were in when you originally cast the spell.]</p>
<p>[Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish
a long rest.]</p>

<h2>Warlock Archetype</h2>
<p>[At 1st level, you have reached out to, stumbled upon, or otherwise
crossed paths with a powerful entity beyond the ken of mortals, an
otherworldly patron who sets you on the path of a Warlock Archetype.
Your choice of archetype grants you an expanded spell list and
additional features at 1st, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.]</p>
<h2>Pact Magic</h2>
<p>[With care, practice, and dedication you have learned to siphon and
channel the otherworldly powers you've gained from your patron.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>[You learn two warlock cantrips of your choice at 1st level and
additional warlock cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Warlock table.  If you gain a bonus cantrip, it
doesn't count against your cantrips known.]</p>
<h3>Spell Points</h3>
<p>[The Warlock table shows how many spell points you have. To cast one of
your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of
spell points dependent on the spell's level, as shown on the table
below. You can also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by
expending the appropriate number of spell points. The maximum spell
level you can cast is shown in the Spell Level column of the Warlock
table. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a rest.]{.c6

<h3>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h3>
<p>[You know your choice of two 1st-level warlock spells, and you learn
more according to the Spells Known column of the Warlock table. Each of
these spells must be of a level that you are able to cast. For instance,
when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new 1st- or
2nd-level spell.]</p>
<p>[Additionally, when you gain a warlock level, you can replace one
warlock spell you know with another warlock spell, which also must be of
a level you can cast.]</p>
<p>[If you gain a bonus spell, it doesn't count against your spells
known.]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>[Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability.
Once you make this choice, you can't change it. You use the chosen
ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use that ability modifier to set the saving throw DC for
your warlock spells and spell attack rolls, as follows:]</p>
<p>Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen
ability modifier]</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your
chosen ability modifier]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
<p>[When casting a warlock spell, you can use an arcane focus as your
spellcasting focus.]</p>
<h2>Eldritch Blast</h2>
<p>At 1st level, choose one of the following features.</p>
<h3>Eldritch Disturbance</h3>
<p>[You can use an action to strike a creature you can see within 60 feet
with a reality-distorting curse, blending pain both mental and physical.
The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 1d10 force damage on a
failure, or half damage on a success.]</p>
<h3>Eldritch Ray</h3>
<p>[You can use an action to create a deadly beam that strikes a creature
within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature,
dealing 1d10 force damage on a hit.]</p>
<h3>Eldritch Scythe</h3>
<p>[Once per turn when you would make a melee weapon attack as part of the
Attack action or an opportunity attack, you can instead make a melee
spell attack, lashing out with an ephemeral and unearthly blade. On hit,
the target takes 1d8 force damage. In addition, you can choose a
creature that you can see and that is within your reach. That creature
takes half as much damage.]</p>
<h3>Eldritch Whip</h3>
<p>[You can use an action to thrash a creature with a scintillating tendril
of arcane force. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 15
feet, dealing 1d6 force damage on a hit.]</p>
<p>[At the end of your turn you gain temporary hit points equal to half the
damage you dealt with Eldritch Whip this turn (minimum 1). These
temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn. When you hit
a creature with your Eldritch Whip and you already have temporary hit
points, you can end the temporary hit points early to gain a bonus to
the Eldritch Whip's damage roll equal to half the temporary hit points
you ended early.]</p>
<h2>Eldritch Invocations</h2>
<p>[You gain an eldritch invocation of your choice at 2nd level and
additional invocations at higher warlock levels, as shown in the
Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.]</p>
<p>[Additionally, when you gain a warlock level, you can replace one of the
invocations you know with another invocation that you could learn at
that level. If you gain a bonus invocation, it doesn't count against
your Invocations known.]</p>
<p>Extra Secrets of Arcana.[ Whenever you would learn a new
invocation in this way, you can learn a secret of arcana instead.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h2>Secrets of Arcana</h2>
<p>[Also at 2nd level, you gain a secret of arcana of your choice. Your
secrets are detailed at the end of the class description. The Secrets
Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more secrets of
arcana.]</p>
<h2>Pact Boon</h2>
<p>At 3rd level, choose one of the following features.</p>
<h3>Pact of the Blade</h3>
<p>[You can use your action to conjure in your empty hand an armament
bestowed with power: a pact weapon. Choose any simple or martial weapon
when you conjure your pact weapon. You are proficient with your pact
weapon while you wield it, and you can use your spellcasting ability for
attack and damage rolls with it. This weapon counts as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. Your pact weapon
disappears if it is more than 5 feet away for 1 minute, if you die, if
you use this feature again, or if you dismiss the weapon (no action
required).]</p>
<p>[By performing a 1-hour ritual while holding a magic weapon or rare
weapon (but not an artifact or sentient weapon), you can transform it
into your pact weapon. If this weapon has a bonus to attack or damage
rolls, or if it deals bonus damage, you can apply these to your Eldritch
Blast (a ranged weapon adds these bonuses to Eldritch Ray, and a melee
weapon adds them to Eldritch Scythe; the weapon has no effect on
Eldritch Disturbance or Eldritch Whip). The weapon disappears into an
extradimensional space when not used, and it appears whenever you
conjure your pact weapon. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if
you die, if you perform the ritual on a different weapon, or if you
perform the ritual to break your bond to the weapon. The weapon is
collected by your patron if the bond breaks while it is in the
extradimensional space.]</p>
<h3>Pact of the Chain</h3>
<p>You learn the find familiar[ spell as a bonus spell, and
you can cast it as a ritual. When you cast the spell, in addition to the
normal forms you can choose, you can choose an imp, pseudodragon,
quasit, sprite, or any Tiny creature of CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt
for the spirit you call forth to be of the aberration, elemental, or
undead type.]</p>

<p>[Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish
a long rest.]</p>
<h2>Diabolist</h2>
<h3>Sanguine Contract</h3>
<p>[When you take this archetype at 1st level, choose one of the
following:]</p>
<h4>Dark Blessing</h4>
<p>[When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, or when a creature under
one of your spell effects is reduced to 0 hit points, you gain a number
of temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier +
your warlock level (minimum 1).]</p>
<h4>Diabolical Curse</h4>
<p>[Once per rest, you can use a bonus action to place a curse on a
creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and
it ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.
The curse has the following effects:]</p>
<ul>
<li>[Choose fire or necrotic damage. When you deal damage to the cursed
    creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen type. This
    additional damage increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and again at 15th
    and 20th level.]</li>
<li>[When the cursed creature dies, you regain hit points equal to your
    spellcasting ability modifier + your warlock level (minimum 1).]{.c6
    .c7}</li>
</ul>
<h4>Dogs of Hell</h4>
<p>[Starting at 6th level, once per rest when you kill a creature under the
effects of your Diabolical Curse or one of your warlock spells, you can
bid your patron conjure into your service a death dog or a ghoul (your
choice). The creature appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. The
creature rolls its own initiative, has its own turns, and obeys your
verbal commands. The creature disappears after 1 minute, when you are
knocked unconscious, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.]</p>
<p>[At 15th level, you can bid your patron to conjure a hell hound or a
wight instead.]</p>
<h4>Blasphemous Act</h4>
<p>[Starting at 10th level, when you finish a long rest you gain a Channel
Divinity feature. This feature must be from a cleric archetype and be
granted to clerics at 2nd level. Alternatively, you can instead gain
Turn Undead with the benefit of the Command Undead feature.]</p>
<p>[Once you have used the chosen Channel Divinity feature, you can't do so
again until you finish a rest.]</p>
<h4>Hurl Through Hell</h4>
<p>[Starting at 14th level, once per long rest when you hit a creature with
an attack, you can use this feature to instantly fling it through the
most horrific vistas of the multiverse. The creature disappears until
the end of your next turn, reappearing in the space it previously
occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. Unless the creature is a
fiend, it takes 10d10 cold, fire, or psychic damage (your choice).]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h2>Spellbound</h2>
<h3>Rewoven With Magic</h3>
<p>When you take this archetype at 1st level, you learn [druidcraft
][as a bonus cantrip. Additionally, choose one of the
following:]</p>
<h4>Quickling Sprint</h4>
<p>[You can use a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to take the
Dash or Disengage action. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you
finish a rest.]</p>
<h4>Spellbinder's Curse</h4>
<p>[Once per rest, you can use a bonus action to place a curse on a
creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts for 1 minute, and
it ends early if the target dies, you die, or you become incapacitated.
The curse has the following effects:]</p>
<ul>
<li>[Choose lightning or thunder damage. When you deal damage against
    the cursed creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen
    type. This additional damage increases by 1d4 at 10th level, and
    again at 15th and 20th level.]</li>
<li>[You gain a pool of faerie dice, which begins empty. Each faerie die
    represents a bit of good fortune from your patron. When the cursed
    creature makes an ability check or attack roll with disadvantage,
    add one faerie die to this pool. You can spend a faerie die when
    making an ability check or attack roll to gain a 1d4 bonus. The pool
    disappears when you finish a rest.]</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mischievous Mobility</h3>
<p>At 6th level, choose one of the following:</p>
<h4>Can't Catch Me</h4>
<p>[When an attack misses you, you can use your reaction to teleport a
distance up to your Speed. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.]</p>
<h4>Fairy Dust</h4>
<p>[Your patron grants you a bag of fairy dust, which contains a number of
uses equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use a bonus action to
sprinkle this fairy dust on yourself or a creature within 15 feet. The
target gains a fly speed of 30 feet (with the ability to hover) for 10
minutes.]</p>
<p>[A creature other than you that attempts to use the fairy dust must make
an Arcana check equal to your spell save DC or the dust has no effect.
When you finish a long rest, your previous bag of fairy dust disappears
and you receive a new bag of fairy dust.]</p>
<h3>Toadstool Sanctuary</h3>
<p>[At 10th level, when you are in a forest, woodlands, or other healthy
greenspace, you can dance, sing, or chant for 1 minute to create a
circle of mushrooms in the unoccupied space around you. The mushroom
circle can have a radius of up to 15 feet (minimum diameter 5 feet).
Creatures that rest in your toadstool sanctuary for 10 minutes gain the
benefits of a short rest.]</p>
<p>[Your toadstool sanctuary lasts for 7 days or until you use this feature
again. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish
a long rest. Creatures that benefit from your toadstool sanctuary can't
do so again for 24 hours.]</p>
<h3>Fairies' Retreat</h3>
<p>[At 14th level, you can use an action to teleport yourself and up to
five willing creatures you can see within 30 feet. Each creature
disappears in a flash of bright color or a vortex of leaves, then
reappears up to 1 mile away in the nearest unoccupied space within 30
feet of either your Toadstool Sanctuary or a fairy ring or monolith
consecrated to the fey that you have previously seen. If you are already
at such a location when you use this feature, you and the creatures
instead teleport to or return from the Dreaming.]</p>
<p>[Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish
a long rest.]</p>

</ul>
<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
<p>[At 1st level you have a spellbook containing the written spells you
study. You use your spellbook to cast your spells.]</p>
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
<p>[You learn three wizard cantrips of your choice at 1st level and
additional wizard cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Wizard Spells table. Additionally, you know the
]prestidigitation cantrip.</p>
<h3>Spellbook</h3>
<p>[At 1st level, your spellbook contains six 1st-level wizard spells of
your choice. Your spellbook contains all of the wizard spells you know,
except your cantrips, which you maintain in your memory.]</p>
<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>
<p>[To prepare wizard spells to make them available to cast, choose a
number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). You can't prepare a
spell with a higher level than your highest-level spell slot.]</p>
<p>[To cast a wizard spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell's
level or higher. The Wizard Spells table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your wizard spells. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.]</p>
<p>[Casting spells doesn't remove them from your list of prepared
spells.]</p>
<p>[During a long rest, you can change your list of prepared spells by
studying your spellbook.]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>[Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You
use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier to set the
saving throw DC for your wizard spells and spell attack rolls, as
follows:]</p>
<p>Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier]</p>
<p>Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier]</p>
<h3>Ritual Casting</h3>
<p>[You can cast a wizard spell in your spellbook as a ritual if that spell
can be cast as a ritual.]</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
<p>[When casting a wizard spell, you can use an arcane focus as your
spellcasting focus.]</p>
<h3>Learning Spells of 1st-Level and Higher</h3>
<p>[Whenever you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your
choice to your spellbook for free. You can't prepare a spell with a
higher level than your highest-level spell slot.]</p>
<h3>Your Spellbook</h3>
<p>[As you research magic and spells, you will add new spells to your
spellbook. ]</p>
<p>Copying a Spell into the Book[. When you find a
wizard spell of 1st-level or higher in a scroll or spellbook, you can
add it to your spellbook if its level isn't higher than your
highest-level spell slot. Doing so costs 2 hours and 50 gp per spell
level.]</p>
<p>Replacing the Book[. You can copy a spell you know into
another spellbook, in case you want to share a spell, create a backup
copy of your spellbook, or replace a lost spellbook. Copying a spell you
know costs only 1 hour and 10 gp per spell level.]</p>
<h2>Arcane Recovery</h2>
<p>[Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover expended
spell slots with a combined level equal to or less than half your wizard
level (rounded up). You can't recover a 6th-level or higher spell
slot.]</p>
<h2>Wizard Archetype</h2>
<p>[At 2nd level, you choose a tradition of magic that you have dedicated
your studies to. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.]</p>
<h2>Scholarly Excellence</h2>
<p>At 3rd level, choose one of the following:</p>
<h3>Academic</h3>
<p>[You gain four specialties from Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History,
Nature, and Religion. Unlike normal specialties, academic specialties
can be taken twice (increasing the specialty's expertise die to
1d6).]</p>
<p>[In addition, when you use either Deception or Persuasion to make a
point related to one of your academic specialties, you can apply your
expertise die from that specialty to the check, and you can use
Intelligence the check.]</p>
<h3>Ritual Efficiency</h3>
<p>[When you cast a spell as a ritual, you add only 1 minute to the casting
time (instead of 10 minutes).]</p>
<h3>Rote Memorization</h3>
<p>[Choose one cantrip you know that has a casting time of 1 action and
doesn't deal damage. You can cast that cantrip as a bonus action without
any seen or material components a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you
finish a long rest. Each time you gain a wizard level, you can change
the cantrip associated with this feature each time with another eligible
cantrip you know.]</p>
<h2>Elective Studies</h2>
<p>[At 4th level you gain one elective study of your choice. Elective
studies are detailed at the end of the class description. The Studies
Known column of the Wizard table shows when you learn more elective
studies. Unless otherwise noted, you can gain each study only once.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h2>Ability Score Improvement</h2>
<p>[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]</p>
<h2>Signature Spells</h2>
<p>[At 5th level, you have developed your spellcasting skill and honed it
into spells that you consider to be your Signature Spells.]</p>
<p>[Choose one 1st-level wizard spell that is in your spellbook. You always
have this spell prepared, it doesn't count toward your maximum prepared
spells. In addition, once per rest you can cast this spell at its lowest
level without expending a spell slot.]</p>
<p>[At higher levels, you gain additional Signature Spells, each of which
you can cast once between rests. At 11th level, you can choose one
2nd-level or lower Signature Spell. At 17th level, you can choose one
3rd-level or lower Signature Spell. Each time you gain a level in this
class, you can replace one of your Signature Spells with another of the
same level or lower.]</p>
<h2>Spell Study</h2>
<p>[At 7th level, choose one Spell Study that reflects what you have
dedicated your arcane studies to.]</p>
<h3>Arcane Objects</h3>
<p>[When you touch a magic item, either willingly or when you are hit by
it, you are immediately aware that it's magical. If you hold such an
item in your hand, you can cast ]identify[ on it as an
action without expending a spell slot, even if you don't have the spell
prepared.]</p>
<p>In addition, when you cast identify[ using a spell slot
or as a ritual, you also learn if the item is cursed, and the Narrator
will give you a hint as to the curse's effects (which might be cryptic
and vague, but must not be a lie).]</p>
<h3>Detective Spell Study</h3>
<p>[You automatically sense the presence of magical effects, such as a
spell effect on an object or a spell effect in an area, within 20 feet.
You don't know what the effects are or where they are located, only that
such effects are near you.]</p>
<p>In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add [detect
magic] and detect thoughts[ to your spellbook if
they weren't already there. Whenever you cast ][detect
magic][, the range in which you can sense magic increases to 60
feet. Whenever you cast ]detect thoughts[, the range in
which you can read thoughts increases to 60 feet.]</p>
<h3>Fauna and Flora</h3>
<p>[Your research into plants, wildlife, and the natural workings of magic
grants you superior insights into the magic of living creatures and
flora. When a beast or plant makes a saving throw against a spell you
cast, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.]</p>
<h2>Wizard's Flair</h2>
<p>[At 9th level, choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a
long rest, you can replace your flair with another.]</p>
<p>[Once per rest, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can
choose to cast it with your flair. You must choose whether to cast with
flair when you declare you're casting the spell, before any rolls are
made.]</p>
<h3>Awe and Wonder</h3>
<p>[Choose one creature affected by the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn. While
charmed in this way, it is incapacitated, has a Speed of 0, and does
nothing but stare blankly at the dazzling effects of your magic. The
effect ends early if the target takes damage or is forced to make a
saving throw.]</p>
<h3>Terror</h3>
<p>[Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the
spell. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of
you until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, it
starts its turn by using its full movement to get away from you in the
most direct manner possible, avoiding obvious hazards along the
way.]</p>
<h3>Brilliance</h3>
<p>[Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the
spell. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be
blinded until the end of its next turn.]</p>
<h3>Warding</h3>
<p>[After casting the spell, until the start of your next turn, a creature
who attempts to attack you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failure, it must choose a new target or waste its attack.]</p>
<h2>Bestow Magics</h2>
<p>[At 13th level, you can transfer your magic to another creature. To do
so, you must touch a willing creature, expend a spell slot of 3rd-level
or lower, and concentrate for 1 minute. At the end of this time, choose
a spell you have prepared of the expended spell slot's level or lower.
The creature can cast the spell using the slot you expended, following
its normal rules for casting time, spell components, range, and
concentration, but using your spellcasting ability modifier, spell
attack modifier, and spell save DC. You can have only one spell imbued
at a time. If you bestow a spell upon a different creature, the spell
slot remains expended and the previous spell dissipates, its magic
unspent.]</p>
<h2>Arcane Defenses</h2>
<p>[At 15th level, your training has granted you certain protections
against magic. Choose one of the following:]</p>
<h3>Mental Discipline</h3>
<p>[Once per rest, when you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.]</p>
<h3>Mystic Mantle</h3>
<p>[You and creatures within 10 feet have resistance to damage dealt by
spells.]</p>
<h3>Superior Countermagic</h3>
<p>[When you make an ability check as part of casting
]counterspell or dispel magic[, you add your
proficiency bonus to the roll.]</p>
<p>[In addition, when you cast either of these spells, treat the spell slot
level of the spell as one level higher than the actual slot you spent.
The slot you use to cast the spell must still be at least
3rd-level.]</p>
<h2>Spell Intensity</h2>
<p>[At 18th level, choose one of the following features, which can be used
to augment your wizard spells of 5th-level or lower. You must choose
whether to augment the spell when you declare you're casting it, before
any rolls are made.]</p>
<p>[The first time you use this feature to augment a spell, you suffer no
adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long
rest, your hit point maximum and current hit points are reduced by 1d12
per level of the spell you augmented (cantrips count as 1st-level spells
for this purpose). This reduction lasts until you finish a long
rest.]</p>
<h3>Binding</h3>
<p>[After you have affected a creature with a spell that has a duration and
it is able to end the spell's effect on itself with a successful saving
throw, it must succeed on that saving throw twice to end the
effect.]</p>
<h3>Burn</h3>
<p>[Any creature that takes damage from the spell takes that damage again
at the start of your next turn, unless a ][dispel
magic][ spell of any level is cast on it before then or if it's in
an ]antimagic field at the time.</p>
<h3>Chain</h3>
<p>[If the spell you cast normally targets only a single creature, it can
also target up to two more creatures within 15 feet of the initial
target.]</p>
<h3>Duality</h3>
<p>[If the spell you cast requires concentration and you're already
concentrating on another spell, you can maintain concentration on both

<h2>Arcanist</h2>
<h3>Scholarly Specialty</h3>
<p>[When you take this archetype at 2nd level, choose one classical school
of magic as your Scholarly Specialty: abjuration, conjuration,
divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or
transmutation. The gold and time you must spend to copy spells from this
school into your spellbook is halved. If a feature refers to your chosen
school, it refers to the school selected in this feature.]</p>
<h3>Esoteric Talent</h3>
<p>Also at 2nd level, you gain one of the following benefits:</p>
<h4>Bend Magic</h4>
<p>[When you cast a wizard spell with an instantaneous duration that deals
damage to an area, you can choose a number of creatures in the area that
you can see equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one creature).
The chosen creatures take no damage from the spell.]</p>
<h4>Flash of Insight</h4>
<p>[You can use a bonus action to roll a d20, record the result, and choose
a creature you can see within 30 feet. The next time that creature makes
an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it takes that d20 result
instead of rolling. If you use this feature again before you finish a
short rest, you must expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to do
so.]</p>
<h4>Quick Step</h4>
<p>[After you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you can
immediately move up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks or
spending any of your normal movement.]</p>
<h3>Refined Learning</h3>
<p>At 6th level, choose one of the following benefits:</p>
<h4>Arcane Armor</h4>
<p>[When you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you store some of
its magic to protect yourself, gaining temporary hit points equal to
twice the level of the spell, or three times the spell's level if the
spell is from your chosen school. Instead of gaining these temporary hit
points yourself, you can use your reaction to grant them to a creature
you can see within 30 feet.]</p>
<h4>Energy Retention</h4>
<p>[When you expend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to cast a wizard
spell from your chosen school, you regain one expended spell slot. The
regained spell slot must be of a level no more than half the level of
the expended spell slot.]</p>
<h4>War Magic</h4>
<p>[When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school that deals damage,
you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
+1) on the first damage roll for that spell.]</p>

feature from either Esoteric Talent or Refined Learning.]</p>

that only affects one creature, you can choose to affect an additional
creature within range.]</p>
<h3>Specialized Mastery</h3>

reduce bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take by an amount
equal to the level of the spell.]</p>
<h4>Heightened Potency</h4>
<p>[When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, it is always
treated as though it were cast with a spell slot one level higher
(maximum 9th-level) than the one you used, so long as you expended a
spell slot to cast it. The slot you use to cast the spell must still be
at least equal to the level of the spell.]</p>
<h4>Precise Understanding</h4>

into your spellbook is reduced to 40 gp per spell level (instead of 50
gp per level).]</p>
<h3>Flexible Thinking</h3>
<p>[Also at 2nd level, once per rest you can use an action to replace one
spell you have prepared with any other spell in your spellbook.]{.c6
.c7}</p>
<h3>Flux</h3>
<p>[At 6th level, you gain Flux, the ability to bend your magic in
flexible, constantly-changing ways. When you finish a rest, choose one
of the benefits from the following list. You can expend your Flux to use

benefit to a different one. If you do, you regain your Flux. Otherwise
you regain your Flux when you finish a rest.]</p>
<p>Ad Hoc Defense.[ When you take damage, you can use your
reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to your proficiency
bonus.]</p>
<p>Elusive.[ You can use a bonus action up to teleport 15 feet
to an unoccupied space you can see.]</p>
<p>Reactive Ward.[ When you make a saving throw, you can use
your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the result (minimum
+1). You can do so after the roll is made, but before any of its effects
are resolved.]</p>
<p>Spell Intensity.[ When you cast a spell that deals damage,
you can increase the spell's first damage roll by an amount equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).]</p>

action (instead of as an action).]</p>

Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on
spells.]</p>

without expending your Flux. When you gain a level in this class, you
can replace the chosen effect with a different Flux effect.]</p>
<h2>Pyromancer</h2>
<h3>Cleansing Fire</h3>
<p>[When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you learn how to use flame
to heal aw well as harm. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell of
1st-level or higher that deals fire damage, you can choose one creature
that would take damage from the spell. Instead of taking damage from the
spell, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to the spell's
level plus your proficiency bonus.]</p>
<h3>Rituals of Fire</h3>
<p>[Also at 2nd level, you can spend 10 minutes meditating while staring
into a flame that fills at least a 5-foot cube to cast
]augury without expending a spell slot.</p>

spend 10 minutes in meditation, you can cast ][locate
creature] without expending a spell slot.</p>
<p>[At 10th level, once per rest, you can step into a fire large enough to
fully contain you and cast ]dream[ without expending a
spell slot. When you cast ]dream[ in this way, you act as
the spell's messenger. You take no damage from the fire, but if the fire
goes out before you end the spell, you take 4d6 psychic damage and the
spell ends.]</p>
<h3>Clinging Flames</h3>
<p>[At 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals fire damage and forces a
saving throw, creatures that fail their first saving throw against it
take ongoing fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
1). At the start of each of its turns, the creature repeats the saving
throw, ending the ongoing fire damage on a success.]</p>
<h3>Blazing Mastery</h3>
<p>[At 10th level, fire damage from your spells treats immunity to fire
damage as though it were fire resistance, and ignores fire resistance
entirely. Additionally, you gain resistance to fire damage, as well as
immunity to fire damage dealt by your own spells.]</p>
<h3>Offerings in Kind</h3>
<p>[At 14th level, you can seek the aid of higher powers in your time of
need. As an action, you urge the spirits of fire to intervene and roll
1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than your wizard level, the
intervention comes immediately. If not, the spirits make a demand in
turn (which may be a high price) and do not intervene until the price is
paid. The Narrator determines the price, as well as the exact nature of
the intervention, though a wizard spell of any level is usually
appropriate. If intervention occurs, this feature can't be used again
for 7 days. Otherwise, you can try again after a long rest. The scope of
this power is dependent on the Narrator's discretion---for a high enough
price, anything is possible.]</p>
<p>[In addition, you can copy any fire spell into your spellbook as if it
were a wizard spell. Once you do, it is a wizard spell for you.]{.c6
