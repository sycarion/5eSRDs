<h1>Multiclassing</h1>
<p>Whenever you gain a character level, you can choose to gain a level in a different class instead of gaining the next level in your current class. Your character level is the total number of levels you have in any classes.<br />
Multiclassing allows you to freely develop your adventurer in whatever direction you see fit. Compared to an adventurer of a single class, you’ll have a wider range of options, but you will reach more powerful class features later than most.</p>
<h1>Experience Points</h1>
<p>If your game is utilizing experience points (XP), your XP cost to gain new class levels is based on your character level and not your level in any class. </p>
<h1>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h1>
<p>You gain a class’s hit points described for 1st level only from your very first level as a 1st level character. Any levels gained from multiclassing gain the hit points as described for levels after 1st level, even if they would be the first level gained in a particular class.<br />
If your classes both provide the same hit die type, you can simply pool them together. If your classes provide different hit die types, you must keep track of them separately and you may spend them as you choose for any features that require hit dice.</p>
<h1>Proficiency Bonus</h1>
<p>Your proficiency bonus is based on your character level, not on any one class. </p>
<h1>Proficiencies</h1>
<p>You only gain some of the 1st level proficiencies from classes taken after your first class, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.</p>

<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>
<p>You only gain the starting equipment of your first class at 1st level. You do not gain any additional starting equipment from your first levels in additional classes.</p>
<h1>Class Features</h1>
<p>Whenever you gain a new level in a class, you gain the class features for that level. Some features are found in multiple classes and need additional rules when combined: <strong>Alternate Armor Class</strong>, <strong>Combat Maneuvers</strong>, <strong>Extra Attack</strong>, and <strong>Spellcasting</strong>.</p>
<h1>Alternate Armor Class</h1>
<p>Multiple instances of any feature that provides an alternate Armor Class calculation do not stack and cannot combine in any way. If you have multiple features that provide an alternate Armor Class calculation, your AC is equal to the highest Armor Class calculation that currently applies.</p>
<h1>Combat Maneuvers</h1>
<p>If you gain the Combat Maneuvers class feature from more than one class, you gain any additional combat traditions or maneuvers the features provide but your exertion pool remains the same and does not stack.<br />
<strong><em>Heralds.</em></strong> The herald is an exception to this rule. If your first levels are in the herald class, you gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You regain exertion spent from this pool at the end of a rest.</p>
<p>You use your class levels in every class that grants combat maneuvers to determine the highest degree of combat maneuvers you can learn, determined by the class with the greatest access. </p>
<h1>Extra Attack</h1>
<p>You cannot stack multiple instances of the Extra Attack feature from multiple classes, and additional instances of the feature do not add additional attacks.<br />
<strong><em>Fighters and Marshals.</em></strong> The additional 11th level Extra attack feature gained by fighters and marshals are both exceptions to this rule (a fighter 5/marshal 6 can attack 3 times with the Attack action.)</p>
<h1>Spellcasting</h1>
<p>If you gain the Spellcasting feature from only one class you follow the spellcasting rules found in that class. However, if you gain the Spellcasting feature from different classes you must use the following rules.</p>
<h2>Spells Known and Prepared</h2>
<p>You know and prepare the spells of each of your classes as if you only had levels in that class. Each spell you know and prepare uses the Spellcasting feature of the associated class, including spellcasting ability and any spellcasting focus.</p>

</table>
<p>Your total number of spell slots is determined by adding together all the class levels you have from classes with the Spellcasting feature, but some classes do not count as highly as others when determining your spell slots.<br />
Your class levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes all count fully towards your spell slots.<br />
Half your levels in the herald class count towards your spell slots.<br />
One third of your levels in the ranger class with the Wildborn archetype count towards your spell slots.<br />
Use this total to determine your spell slots using the Multiclass Spellcaster table.<br />
This table may provide you with spell slots at levels higher than you can prepare or know. While you cannot use these slots for spells you don’t know or can’t prepare, you can still use them to enhance many lower level spells.</p>
<h2>Pact Magic</h2>
<p>If you have a Spellcasting class feature and the warlock’s Pact Magic class feature, you may spend spell points gained from your Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know from your Spellcasting class feature. Similarly, you can use spell slots gained from your Spellcasting feature to cast warlock spells you know.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Feats</h1>
<p>A feat grants an adventurer special abilities beyond their class features.<br />
Whenever your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can instead choose a feat. Unless otherwise noted, you can take each feat only once.<br />
In order to take a feat or gain its benefits, you must meet its prerequisites (if any). </p>
<h1>Magical Feats</h1>
<p>If you are a warlock and select a feat that allows you to choose your spellcasting ability (such as taking Power Caster and choosing a warlock cantrip), you must use the spellcasting ability chosen when you became a warlock. When taking multiple feats that allow you to choose your spellcasting ability and selecting options to cast warlock spells, you must use the spellcasting ability chosen when you took the first of these feats.</p>

<li>You have advantage on Deception and Performance checks made when attempting to mimic another creature’s looks, mannerisms, or speech.  </li>
<li>You have a natural talent for perfectly mimicking the sounds of other creatures you’ve heard make sound for at least 1 minute. A suspicious listener can see through your perfect mimicry by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Untamed</h2>
<p><em>Prerequisites: 3 levels in berserker, 3 levels in druid (Skinchanger archetype)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Your Strength or Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.  </li>
<li>You may enter a rage and assume a wild shape using the same bonus action.  </li>
<li>While using a wild shape, you can use Furious Critical with attacks made using natural weapons.  </li>
<li>Any temporary hit points you gain from assuming a wild shape while raging become rage hit points instead.  </li>
<li>You may cast and concentrate on druid spells with a range of Self or Touch while raging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Living Stampede</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Untamed feat</em><br />
Whenever you enter a rage you may choose up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier within 60 feet that are beasts, fey, or plants. These chosen creatures gain the following benefits for as long as you rage, but are unable to take the Fall Back reaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.  </li>
<li>Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.  </li>
<li>Temporary hit points equal to your level.  </li>
<li>A bonus to damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wild Rioter</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Living Stampede feat</em></p>
<p>While raging, you and any creatures benefiting from your Living Stampede emit 5-foot auras of fury. When a creature other than you or your allies enters a fury aura or starts its turn there it makes a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature becomes confused, except instead of rolling to determine their actions as normal for the confused condition, they are always considered to have rolled the 7 or 8 result. At the end of each of a confused creature’s turns it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to it for the remainder of your rage.</p>
<h2>Vendetta</h2>
<p>Something or someone has had a profound impact on your life—and earned your unending rancor. You gain an expertise die on attack rolls and initiative checks made against creatures that are part of your vendetta, and when making a saving throw to resist an attack, feature, maneuver, spell, or trait from a creature that is part of your vendetta. Whether or not a creature is part of your vendetta is at the Narrator’s discretion.</p>
<h3>Revenant</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisites: Vendetta, one other feat or previous Ability Score Improvement, dead</em><br />
You may choose to select this feat when you die, replacing your most recently chosen feat other than Vendetta or reducing your ability scores to reverse your last Ability Score Improvement. The next midnight your corpse rises and your soul returns to it. You gain the undead type in addition to being a humanoid, as well as the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your destiny changes to Revenge.  </li>
<li>You gain resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.  </li>
<li>You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet (or if you already have it, its range increases by 30 feet).  </li>
<li>You become immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.  </li>
<li>If your vendetta has not ended, you regain all of your hit points when you finish a short rest or 1 hour after you are reduced to 0 hit points.  </li>
<li>You gain an expertise die on saving throws made against spells and other magical effects, and on saving throws made to resist being charmed, fatigued, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned.  </li>
<li>You gain an expertise die on ability checks made to find or track a creature that is part of your vendetta.</li>

<li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  </li>
<li>You regain all of your hit points after you do not take any damage for 1 minute.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you also gain the Fearsome Pursuit and Burning Hatred features.<br />
<strong>Fearsome Pursuit.</strong> You can spend 1 minute focusing on a creature that is part of your vendetta. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, you learn that. Otherwise, after focusing, you know the distance and direction to that creature, and so long as you’re moving in pursuit of that creature, you and anyone traveling with you ignore difficult terrain. This effect ends if you take damage or end your turn without moving for any reason.<br />
<strong>Burning Hatred.</strong> You can use an action to target the focus of your Fearsome Pursuit if it is within 30 feet. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your highest mental ability score modifier). On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to 1d6 × your proficiency bonus and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and is rattled until the end of its next turn. Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

<li>You gain a 1d8 expertise die and advantage on Deception checks made regarding your alter ego, Persuasion checks made to dissuade others from connecting you to your alter ego, and on disguise kit checks.  </li>

The grappled creature makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed saving throw, a creature is knocked unconscious for the next hour. A creature with more than 25% of its maximum hit points automatically succeeds on this saving throw.</p>
