<h1>Enchanted Gear</h1>
<h1>Magic Items</h1>
<h2>Category</h2>
<p>Every magic item falls into one of the following categories: armor, potion, ring, rod, scroll, staff, wand, weapon, or wondrous item. In addition, some items are more particular and use a set of general rules specific to a subcategory like gear gremlins or patron tokens.</p>
<h3>Charms</h3>
<p>Charms are magic items that can be attached to a nonmagical item (like a bracelet or necklace) or worn as an earring. A charm attached to a magic item confers no benefits unless its rarity is greater, in which case the magic item the charm is attached to confers no benefits.</p>
<h3>Gear Gremlins</h3>
<p>Gear gremlins are Tiny magical quasi-real creatures summoned through technomancy to fulfill a purpose, and each is ethereal and unable to interact with objects on the Material Plane—except for their housing items and items they were specifically designed to interact with. A gear gremlin has Armor Class 10 and 1 hit point, though it can only be damaged by creatures on the Ethereal Plane or by creatures who can specifically affect creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Gear gremlins have limited intelligence and can speak Common, though they typically only converse about subjects that relate to their purpose.</p>
<h3>Patron Tokens</h3>
<p>Familiars, tomes, and weapons are among the most impressive gifts otherworldly patrons grant their servants—other things are simply baubles designed to delight or unsettle the recipient and those around them. Warlocks typically receive these tokens after completing a significant task, such as when they defeat the patron’s enemies or further its interests in the mortal realm. A servant may deliver it directly, or a gift may appear mysteriously among the warlock’s belongings while their attention is focused elsewhere. Patron tokens function only for the warlock who receives them. </p>
<h2>Rarity</h2>
<p>Magic items range from small things that are surprisingly useful to potent relics of unimaginable power. The availability of a magic item, as well as its lowest and highest possible price, are determined by its rarity. More common magic items might be found among the kit of many adventurers, while rare magic items can only be afforded by successful adventurers or wealthy nobles, and legendary magic items are just that—the stuff of legends.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Each magic item is also listed with a suggested cost for purchase, though the Narrator may choose to reduce or increase the price of any piece of enchanted gear depending on the campaign.</p>

<h2>Attunement</h2>
<p>The magical properties of some magic items are locked away until they have linked to the creature bearing them, bonding the energies of both together into attunement. Certain pieces of enchanted gear have prerequisites that must be met before they can be attuned to, such as levels in a class. In the case of monsters attuning to an item that requires levels in a spellcasting class, the monster must have spell slots and have access to the prerequisite class spell list. Any creature able to cast one spell qualifies as a spellcaster for the purposes of attunement.<br />
Magic items that require attunement are treated as mundane unless they are described otherwise—a magic sword is still a magic sword, but if it requires attunement it does not deal magical damage or confer its other properties until the creature wielding it has attuned to the blade.<br />
The process of attunement requires a creature to finish a short rest where all it does is remain in physical contact with and focus upon the magic item. This could mean practicing with a magic weapon, concentrating on the details of a wondrous item, referencing arcane tomes, or praying for guidance. An interrupted short rest ruins the attempt to attune to the magic item. Once attuned the creature intuitively knows how to activate the magic item and any command words, but not if it is cursed (or how it is cursed).<br />
Unless it has a feature or trait that allows it, a creature can be attuned to a maximum of three magic items at a time. Attempts to attune to additional magic items fail until the creature ends one of its attunements first. In addition, it is impossible to attune to two identical items at the same time.<br />
The most common method to end an attunement is by finishing a short rest focused on the item, but it can also be ended in the following ways: the magic item is more than 100 feet away from the creature for 24 hours, the creature no longer meets the attunement prerequisites, or the creature dies.</p>
<h2>Identifying Magic Items</h2>
<p>A magic item that requires attunement can have its properties identified by a creature that attunes to it, but otherwise learning what a piece of enchanted gear is and what it can do is the remit of learned minds or magic like the <em>identify</em> spell. Identifying a magic item is similar to the process for attuning to one and requires just as much concentration. A creature can spend a short rest inspecting a magic item, making an ability check at the end against a DC based on the magic item’s rarity (see Table: Identifying Magic Items) after searching its memories for references as it scrutinizes the magic item for clues. The type of the ability check and any skills used for it are at the Narrator’s discretion, determined by the magic item and its origins, but often include Arcana, Culture, History, Nature, or Religion. On a success, at the end of the short rest the creature recognizes what the magic item is and remembers any command words it might require. Whether or not a magic item is cursed requires a success by 10 or more.<br />
<strong>Recognizing Artifacts.</strong> Extremely potent relics are literally items of myth and even when it might not be immediately recognized for what it is, the countless tales about an artifact make it easy to recognize without all of its secrets laid bare.</p>

<h3>Curses</h3>
<p>Remember that most methods of identifying magic items, including the <em>identify</em> spell, fail to reveal an item’s cursed properties so they offer an opportunity to surprise adventurers when the curse is revealed. When describing the items, it’s important for Narrators to highlight their extraplanar connections as the party may be justifiably wary of items with aberrant, fiendish, or otherwise questionable connections.<br />
The curses included with certain magic items in this chapter focus on story possibilities rather than mechanical consequences, and the Narrator can choose to ignore them if their implementation would distract rather than engage the party. Likewise, these items are specific to the adventurer that acquires them and they cannot be sold (even if they were bought).</p>
<h2>Wearing and Wielding Magic Items</h2>
<p>In order for a magic item to function properly it must be worn or wielded as the item intended: feet in boots, hands in gloves, heads under hats or inside helmets, fingers in rings. Magic armors and shields only work when they are donned, weapons have to be wielded, and cloaks fastened around a creature’s shoulders.<br />
Unless noted otherwise, a worn magic item automatically stretches or shrinks to match the size and shape of the creature wearing it. When a nonhumanoid creature attempts to wear a magic item, it’s up to the Narrator whether it works or not.</p>
<h3>Multiple Magic Items of the Same Type</h3>
<p>Most creatures have only two legs and one head so usually a creature can only make use of a single pair of boots and one hat or helmet. Whether or not more than one item can be worn in the same spot is at the Narrator’s discretion. </p>
<h3>Paired Magic Items</h3>
<p>When a magic item is described as a pair, such as a pair of boots, any properties it grants only function when the full set is worn. </p>
<h2>Activating Magic Items</h2>
<p>There are magic items that require a specific activation method, like speaking a command word while holding it. Each magic item’s description provides details on how it is activated, otherwise using the following rules.<br />
Note that the Use an Item action does not apply to magic items—any item that requires an action to activate is treated as its own separate action, not the Use an Item action.</p>
<h3>Charges</h3>
<p>Magic items often have charges which must be expended to activate one or more of their properties. How many charges the magic item has is revealed either when a creature attunes to it or after a casting of the <em>identify</em> spell. In addition, when an attuned magic item regains charges the creature attuned to it knows how many charges have been regained.</p>
<h3>Command Words</h3>
<p>Command words are specific words or phrases that when spoken cause a magic item to use one of its properties. Magic items that require a command word to be spoken can’t be activated in the area of a <em>silence</em> spell or other circumstance where sound is prevented.</p>
<h3>Consumables</h3>
<p>Magic items can also be used up when activated—elixirs and potions have to be swallowed, oils applied to an item or creature’s body, arcane or divine script disappearing as it is read from a spell scroll, and so on. A consumable magic item loses its magic after being used.</p>
<h3>Spells</h3>
<p>Many magic items grant the creature using them the ability to cast one or more spells. Unless stated otherwise, a spell cast from a magic item is cast at the lowest possible spell level, and it requires no components or spell slots. The spell uses its normal rules unless the item describes a change to how the spell functions, and if it requires concentration the creature must maintain concentration on the spell. Some magic items (like potions) simply grant the benefits of a spell, with its usual duration, without requiring the spell be cast or for the creature to concentrate.<br />
When a magic item requires a creature to use its own spellcasting ability and it has more than one spellcasting ability, it chooses which to use. A creature without a spellcasting ability that uses such an item cannot use its proficiency bonus and it treats its spellcasting ability modifier as +0.</p>
<h2>Enchanted Trinkets</h2>
<p>Trinkets are common and uncommon magic items that cost 150 gold or less. Narrators shouldn’t be afraid of rewarding the adventurers with these innocuous enchanted trinkets—they are perfectly suited for enhancing the roleplaying experience without introducing an unbalancing element to the game. Unless the party is in a metropolis known for its arcana or divinity, most shops specializing in magic items will only have a few more expensive pieces but plenty of enchanted trinkets.</p>

<h1>Magic Items A–Z</h1>
<p>Each magic item is presented in alphabetical order with a description, category, rarity, and its magical properties.</p>
<h2>Absurdist Web</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost 11,250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Silk of a giant spider and the soul of an ettercap<br />
When you try to unfold this bed sheet-sized knot of spidersilk, you occasionally unearth a long-dead sparrow or a cricket that waves thanks before hopping away. It’s probably easier just to wad it up and stick it in your pocket. The interior of this ball of web is an extradimensional space equivalent to a 10-foot cube. To place things into this space you must push it into the web, so it cannot hold liquids or gasses. You can only retrieve items you know are inside, making it excellent for smuggling. Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside it. No matter how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.<br />
A creature attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between long rests.<br />
Any creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world.</p>
<h2>Aegis of the Eternal Moon</h2>
<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement; cost 6,075 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Metal that has fallen from space<br />
The circular surface of this gleaming silver shield is marked by dents and craters making it reminiscent of a full moon. While holding this medium shield, you gain a magical +1 bonus to AC. This item has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each night at moonrise.<br />
While this shield is equipped, you may expend 1 charge as an action to cast <em>moonbeam</em>, with the following exceptions: the spell manifests as a line of moonlight 10 feet long and 5 feet wide emanating from the shield, and you may move the beam by moving the shield (no action required). When the first charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a gibbous moon and loses its magical +1 bonus to AC. When the second charge is expended, the shield fades to the shape of a crescent moon and becomes a light shield, granting only a +1 bonus to AC. When the final charge is expended, the shield fades away completely, leaving behind its polished silver handle. When the shield regains charges, it reforms according to how many charges it has remaining.</p>
<h2>Aerodite the Autumn Queen’s True Name</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 120 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Autumn leaf taken from The Dreaming<br />
This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name “Airy Nightengale” surrounded by shifting autumn leaves. While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this parchment to summon a vision of a powerful archfey beside you for 1 minute. Airy acts catty and dismissive but mellows with flattery. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.<br />
You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform minor acts of nature magic (as <em>druidcraft</em>).  </li>
<li>Whisper charming words to a target creature within 5 feet. Creatures whispered to in this way must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save targets become charmed by the vision until the end of their next turn, treating the vision and you as friendly allies.  </li>
<li>Bestow a magical fly speed of 10 feet on a creature within 5 feet for as long as the vision remains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Aerodite in exchange for her direct assistance. When you do so the parchment disappears in a flurry of autumn leaves, and for the next minute the figment transforms into an alluring vision of the Dreaming at a point you choose within 60 feet (as <em>hypnotic pattern</em>, save DC 13). Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Aerodite’s true name again.</p>
<h2>Air Charm</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (charm), uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Feather from a migratory bird collected on its third return home<br />
While wearing this charm you can hold your breath for an additional 10 minutes, or you can break the charm to release its power, destroying it to activate one of the following effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight: Cast <em>fly</em>.  </li>
<li>Float: Cast <em>feather fall</em>.  </li>
<li>Whirl: Cast <em>whirlwind kick</em> (+7 spell attack bonus, spell save DC 15).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Releasing the charm’s power attracts the attention of a <strong>djinni</strong> who seeks you out to request a favor.</p>
<h2>Alliance Rings</h2>
<p><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement; 125 gp each)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Matching rings worn for at least a year by a cleric and a herald<br />
These matched glass rings shimmer from a stitch of eldritch energy that runs through their center. When you and another creature attune to the rings, you each gain the ability to sense your approximate distance from one another. You also receive a slight jolt when the other ring wearer drops to 0 hit points.<br />
When the other ring wearer takes damage, you can use your reaction to concentrate and rotate the ring. When you do so, both you and the other ring wearer receive an image of an elderly herald giving up her life to shield her cleric companion from enemy arrows. The effect, spell, or weapon’s damage dice are rolled twice and the lower result is used. After being used in this way, the energy in each ring disappears and they both become mundane items.</p>
<h2>Amber Wings</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 115 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Tree sap taken from The Dreaming<br />
This pair of amber dragonfly wings holds the memories of a native of the Dreaming who befriended several insect companions. You can speak with insects when carrying the wings in your hand or wearing them as a piece of jewelry. When you speak the name of the fey creature whose memories lie within the wings, you briefly experience the sensation of flying atop a giant dragonfly. For 1 minute after speaking the name, you can glide up to 60 feet per round. This functions as though you have a fly speed of 60 feet, but you can only travel horizontally or on a downward slant. The wings crumble to dust after the gliding effect ends.</p>
<h2>Ammunition +1, +2, or +3</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (cost 500 gp), rare (cost 2,000 gp), or very rare (cost 8,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Naturally fallen branches from a druid’s grove<br />
This ammunition comes in bundles of 10. When used to make a ranged weapon attack, a piece of this ammunition grants a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it: +1 (uncommon), +2 (rare), or +3 (very rare). After hitting a target, a piece of ammunition loses its magical properties.</p>
<h2>Amulet of Health</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Troll heart<br />
Wearing this amulet increases your Constitution score to 19. It has no effect if your Constitution is equal to greater than 19.</p>
<h2>Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Quasit eye<br />
You are hidden from divination magic while wearing this amulet, including any form of scrying (magical scrying sensors are unable to perceive you).</p>
<h2>Amulet of the Planes</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 50,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> <em>Scroll of plane shift</em> crafted by a deceased wizard<br />
While wearing this amulet, as an action you can specify a location familiar to you on another plane of existence, making a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a success you cast the <em>plane shift</em> spell, but on a failure you and every creature and object within a 15-foot radius are magically transported to a random location determined with a d100 roll: 1–60 a random location on the specified plane; 61–100 a random plane of existence.</p>
<h2>Amulet of the Pleasing Bouquet</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Flower potpourri with petals taken from wedding bouquets and flowers laid at gravestones<br />
Various schools of magic employ all manner of particularly foul-smelling and noxious substances, nauseating some would-be wizards to the point of illness. These enchanted amulets were created to guard against the various stenches found in their masters’ laboratories and supply closets. Enterprising apprentices quickly saw the value of peddling the enchanted trinkets to the affluent wishing to avoid the stench of the streets however, and now they are commonplace among nobility.<br />
The most typical of these amulets look like pomanders though dozens of different styles, varieties, and scents are available for sale. While wearing it, you can spend an action and expend 1 charge from the amulet to fill your nostrils with pleasing scents for 1 hour. These scents are chosen by the amulet’s creator at the time of its crafting.<br />
In more extreme circumstances like a <em>stinking cloud</em> spell or troglodyte’s stench, you can expend 3 charges as a reaction to gain advantage on saving throws against the dangerous smell until the end of your next turn.<br />
The amulet has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a or 5 or less, the amulet loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Angel Eyes</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 4,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Glass tempered in a Celestial Plane<br />
Both the frame and lenses of these magnificent spectacles are made of the finest crystal. While you are wearing and attuned to the spectacles, you are immune to mental stress effects that would result from a visual encounter, you have advantage on saving throws against sight-based fear effects, and you are immune to gaze attacks.</p>
<h2>Animated Shield</h2>
<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement; cost 6,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Marilith swords, or a <em>scroll of animate objects</em><br />
As a bonus action, you can verbally command the shield to animate and float in your space, or to stop doing so. The shield continues to act as if you were wearing it but doesn’t require the use of a hand. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, or until you are incapacitated or die. It then returns to your free hand, if you have one, or else it falls to the ground. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p>
<h2>Anthology of Enhanced Radiance</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Assorted vegetables, bound book, bed pillow<br />
This slightly enchanted book holds lessons for how to look healthier. When you spend 1 hour reading and memorizing the book’s lessons, after your next long rest for the following 24 hours you appear as if you’ve slept and eaten well for months. At the end of the duration, the effect ends and you are unable to benefit from this book until 28 days have passed.</p>
<h2>Apparatus of the Crab</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 60,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Dragon turtle shell<br />
This ingeniously crafted item (known by some as the crabaratus) is a tightly shut 500 pound iron barrel. Making a DC 20 Investigation check reveals a hidden catch which unlocks one end of the barrel—a hatch. Two Medium or smaller creatures can crawl inside where there are 10 levers in a row at the far end. Each lever is in a neutral position but can move up or down. Use of these levers makes the barrel reconfigure to resemble a giant metal crab.<br />
This item is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>
<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 20<br />
<strong>Hit Points:</strong> 200<br />
<strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (both are 0 ft. without legs and tail extended)<br />
<strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p>
<p>The item requires a pilot to be used as a vehicle. The apparatus is airtight and watertight, and holds 10 hours worth of breathable air for a single creature, or 10 divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.<br />
The apparatus can float or dive underwater down to 900 feet, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage at the end of each minute spent at a lower depth.<br />
Any creature inside the apparatus can use an action to position one or two of the levers either up or down, with the lever returning to its neutral position upon use. From left to right, the Apparatus of the Crab table shows how each lever functions.</p>

<h2>Archaic Creed</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 60 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Confession of an act of callous cruelty<br />
This crumpled vellum scroll is scrawled with an Infernal statement outlining the beliefs of a specific yet unnamed fiend. Whether or not you can read the language, while studying the statement you gain an expertise die on a Religion check made to recall or learn information about fiends. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br />
By repeatedly reciting the creed aloud as an action each round for 1 minute, you can cast <em>find familiar</em>, except your familiar takes the form of either an <strong>imp</strong> or a <strong>quasit</strong>. The creed is irrevocably absorbed into the familiar’s body and is completely destroyed when the familiar drops to 0 hit points.<br />
<strong>Curse.</strong> The familiar summoned by the creed is cursed. The fiend who wrote the creed can observe you through the summoned familiar, and can command the familiar to take actions while you are asleep or unconscious.</p>
<h2>Armor +1, +2, or +3</h2>

<h2>Armor of Invulnerability</h2>
<p><em>Armor (full plate), legendary (requires attunement; cost 70,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scales from an ancient dragon turtle’s shell<br />
This armor grants you resistance to nonmagical damage. Once between long rests, you can use an action to become immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are remove the armor.</p>
<h2>Armor of Resistance</h2>
<p><em>Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (cost 1,250 gp) or very rare (cost 5,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Lump of elemental matter corresponding to the energy resisted (air for lightning or thunder, astral for psychic, earth for acid, ethereal for force, fire for fire, lower planes for necrotic, shadow for poison, upper planes for radiant, or water for cold)<br />
This armor grants you resistance to one type of damage. The type of damage is determined when the armor is created, from the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, thunder. A suit of light or medium <em>armor of resistance</em> is rare, and a heavy suit is very rare.</p>
<h2>Armor of Vulnerability</h2>
<p><em>Armor (full plate), rare (requires attunement; cost 4,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fool’s gold and rust left over from a rust monster’s attack<br />
This armor grants you resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The type of damage is determined when the armor is created.<br />
<strong>Cursed.</strong> Once attuned to this armor, you are cursed until you are targeted by <em>remove curse</em> or similar magic; removing the armor does not end this curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to the other two damage types this armor does not protect against.</p>
<h2>Arrow-Catching Shield</h2>
<p><em>Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Wood from the winning bulls-eye target from a prestigious archery tournament<br />
This shield grants you +2 to AC against ranged attacks, in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever a target within 5 feet of you is targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to make yourself the target of the attack.</p>
<h2>Arrow of Slaying</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (arrow), very rare (cost 8,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Piece of flint from a stream in primeval forest<br />
A particular kind of creature is chosen when this magic arrow is created. When the <em>arrow of slaying</em> damages a creature belonging to the chosen type, heritage, or group, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Once the <em>arrow of slaying</em> deals this extra damage, it loses its magical properties.<br />
Other types of magic ammunition exist besides arrows.</p>
<h2>Assassin’s Ring</h2>
<p><em>Ring, rare (cost 2,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Gemstone worn by an assassination victim at the time of their death<br />
This unassuming-looking signet ring comes with sinister features. The first is a four-chambered extradimensional space, each of which can hold one dose of poison. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to press part of its filigree to deploy one of the poisons and apply it to a weapon or piece of ammunition. You have advantage on checks made to conceal this action from observers.<br />
In addition, you can use a bonus action to whisper a command word that makes a garrote of shadowy force unspool from the ring. A creature grappled using this garrote has disadvantage on saving throws made to escape the grapple.<br />
This ring’s magic is subtle and creatures have disadvantage on checks made to notice it is magical or determine its purpose.</p>
<h2>Assembling Armor</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 2,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component</strong>: Plates from a damaged suit of armor that saved its wearer from a mortal blow<br />
This thick leather belt pouch jingles softly as if filled with metal rings. This item has 6 charges and regains 1d4 each dawn.<br />
You can use an action to speak one of three command words and expend 1 or more of the pouch’s charges, causing metal rings and plates to stream out of the pouch and assemble into a suit of armor on your body.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leather brigandine (1 charge)  </li>
<li>Half plate (2 charges)  </li>
<li>Full plate (3 charges)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to speak a fourth command word and expend 1 charge to summon a medium shield from the pouch.<br />
If you are already wearing armor that provides equal or greater protection than the armor provided by the pouch, the charges are wasted and nothing happens. If you are wearing armor that provides less protection, the assembling armor reinforces the armor you are already wearing and you benefit from the same level of protection as if you activated the pouch while unarmored. The armor remains on your person for up to 1 hour or until you use an action to dismiss it, after which it disassembles and returns to the pouch.</p>
<h2>Atlas to Libation</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 35 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Tavern sign stolen while drunk<br />
This golden-brown parchment has an odd handle-like wooden stave and a seal marked with an ale tankard. As a bonus action, you can break the seal and unfurl the map. When you do so, the map fills in with accurate topography in a 1-mile radius around you. A miniature image of you appears at the map’s center along with a dotted line leading to an X that marks the nearest potable alcohol. The map immediately rolls back up if brought within 50 feet of alcohol or if no alcohol is within 1 mile when the seal is opened.<br />
Once used in this way, the seal reforms and is usable again after 24 hours.<br />
Alternatively, you can form a cylinder with the map and grasp it by the handle as an action. If you do so, the map hardens into a tall wooden tankard and magically fills with high quality ale, then loses all magical properties and becomes a mundane object.</p>
<h2>Badge of Seasons</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> An annual flower bloomed in each of the 4 seasons<br />
Glowing, magical symbols of spring, summer, autumn, and winter decorate this wooden badge. So long as at least one of the symbols remains on the badge, fey creatures regard you as a figure of authority. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation and Persuasion checks made to influence fey.<br />
Whenever you create your pact weapon, you can choose to imbue it with the magic of one of the badge’s four symbols. For the next minute or until your pact weapon disappears, you gain a benefit related to the chosen symbol:<br />
<strong>Spring:</strong> Whenever you use your pact weapon to damage a creature, you regain 1d4 hit points.<br />
<strong>Summer:</strong> Attacks made with your pact weapon deal an additional 1d6 fire damage.<br />
<strong>Autumn:</strong> Whenever you use your pact weapon to damage a creature, the target makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or it deals half damage with weapon attacks until the end of your next turn.<br />
<strong>Winter:</strong> You can use a bonus action to teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left each take 1d4 cold damage.</p>
<p>The symbol disappears after its effect ends. Once you’ve used all four symbols, the badge becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Bag of Beans</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Dry beans and something stolen from the sack of a cloud giant<br />
This cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans and weighs 1/2 pound plus 1/4 pound for each bean inside.<br />
Pouring the bag’s contents on the ground creates a fiery 10-foot radius explosion. The fire ignites unattended flammable objects. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.<br />
You may also take a bean from the bag and plant it in dirt or sand and water it, producing an effect 1 minute later centered on the location where it was planted.<br />
To determine the effect the Narrator may create something entirely new, choose one from Table: Bag of Beans, or roll.</p>
<h2>Bag of Cheese</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 5 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Piece of cheese taken from a mouse trap baited with it for at least 24 hours<br />
This item is a yellow bag with the word “cheese” embroidered on it (in Common). Any food you put in this bag becomes cheese, but retains its original taste and condition—a moldy and dirty loaf of bread becomes a moldy and dirty piece of cheese. Any non-food items develop a distinctly cheesy aroma.<br />
Alternatively, you can turn the bag inside out, transforming it into 1 Supply worth of any type of mundane cheese.</p>
<h2>Bag of Devouring</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost 10,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Behir stomach<br />
This item is actually an aperture for the mouth of an immense extradimensional creature and is often mistaken for a <em>bag of holding</em>.<br />
The creature can perceive everything placed inside the bag. Up to a cubic foot of inanimate objects can be stored inside, however once per day the creature swallows any inanimate objects inside and spews them into another plane of existence (with the Narrator deciding the plane and time of day). Animal or vegetable matter placed completely inside is instead ingested and destroyed.<br />
When part of a creature is inside the bag (including a creature reaching a hand inside) there is a 50% chance the bag pulls it inside. A creature that ends its turn inside the bag is ingested and destroyed.<br />
A creature inside the bag can try to escape by using an action and making a DC 15 Strength check. Creatures outside the bag can use an action to attempt to reach in and pull a creature out with a DC 20 Strength check. Would-be rescuers are subject to the same 50% chance to be pulled inside.<br />
Piercing or tearing the item destroys it, with anything currently inside shifted to a random location on the Astral Plane. Turning the bag inside out closes the mouth.</p>

<h2>Bag of Holding</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Phase spider silk<br />
This bag’s interior space is larger than its apparent size of roughly 2 feet wide and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds and has an internal volume of 64 cubic feet. No matter what it contains, it weighs 15 pounds. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If you have never interacted with a specific bag of holding before, the first time you use it, it requires 1d4 rounds to take stock of its contents before anything can be retrieved from the bag.<br />
Food or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities—after being in the bag, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored to life by <em>revivify, raise dead,</em> or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.<br />
The bag cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky quality.<br />
If the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane.<br />
Placing a <em>bag of holding</em> inside another extradimensional storage device such as a <em>portable hole</em> or <em>handy haversack</em> results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.</p>
<h2>Bag of Tricks</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon or rare (varies)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Ball of shed chimera fur or a molted owlbear feather<br />
This seemingly empty cloth bag comes in several colors and has a small, furry sphere inside.<br />
You can use an action to pull the sphere from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. Upon landing, it becomes a creature determined by a roll on the Bag of Tricks table (depending on the bag’s color).<br />
The resulting creature is friendly to you and any companions you have. It acts on your turn, during which you can use a bonus action to give it simple commands such as “<em>attack that creature</em>” or “<em>move over there</em>”. If the creature dies or if you use the bag again, the creature disappears without a trace. After the first use each day, there is a 50% chance that a creature from the bag is hostile instead of friendly and obedient.<br />
Once you have used the bag three times, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.</p>

<h2>Barbed Devil’s Bracelet</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Talons of a fiend<br />
The hand on which you wear this bracelet transforms into a claw covered with a dozen wicked spines. Your unarmed attacks with the claw deal 1d6 piercing damage, and you gain an expertise die on Sleight of Hand checks made to steal small items. Your hand returns to normal if you remove the bracelet.<br />
As an action, you can draw upon the claw’s magic to cast <em>produce flame</em>. Whenever you use the claw in this way, one of the bracelet’s spines disappears and your hit point maximum is reduced by 1d8. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. If this effect reduces your hit point maximum to 0, you die and your body permanently transforms into a barbed devil. When the bracelet has no more spines it becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Barrow Bread</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 2 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Rock salt licked by a basilisk<br />
Barrow bread is made from mashing together plantains and starches that are grown in tropical barrows. While this viscous, starchy paste is not actually a bread, it perfectly preserves and maintains the temperature of any food tucked inside it for up to a week, protecting and preserving 1 Supply. The magic is contained in the plantain leaves that are wrapped around the barrow bread. Once unwrapped, the barrow bread itself can be consumed (as 1 Supply) within 15 minutes before the outside elements spoil it.</p>
<h2>Bead of Force</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 3,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Dust from the Astral Plane or a pocket dimension<br />
This ¾-inch diameter sphere of black glass can be thrown up to 60 feet as an action. On impact it creates an explosion in a 10-foot radius area centered on the bead. Creatures in the area make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 force damage on a failure. A sphere of force then surrounds the same area for 1 minute. Any creature that is completely in the area is trapped inside the sphere if it failed its saving throw. Otherwise, it is pushed away from the point of impact until it is outside the sphere.<br />
The wall of the sphere only allows air to pass, stopping all other attacks and effects. A creature inside the sphere can use its action to push against the sides of the sphere, moving up to half its Speed. The sphere only weighs 1 pound if lifted, regardless of the weight of the creatures inside.</p>

<em>cost 200 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Hide of an insect from the Dreaming<br />
This miniature bead is covered with hundreds of small hooks. When you use an action to place it on a creature’s clothing or hide, the bead hangs there imperceptibly and creates a bond between you and the creature. You gain an expertise die on checks made to track the creature while the bead remains on it. To place the bead during combat without being noticed, you must succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the creature’s maneuver DC (or when outside of combat, the creature’s passive Perception).</p>

<h2>Berserker Axe</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 600 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Haft of oak smoothed with wax from an infernal insect<br />
You gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic axe, and while you are attuned to it your hit point maximum is increased by 1 per character level.<br />
<strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> After you attune to this axe you are unwilling to let it out of your reach. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one unless the nearest foe you are aware of is 60 feet or more away from you.<br />
In addition, when you are damaged by a hostile creature you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, on your turn each round you move to the nearest creature and take the Attack action against it, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you incapacitate your current target. When there is more than one possible target, you randomly determine which to attack. You continue to be berserk until there are no creatures you can see or hear within 60 feet of you at the start of your turn.</p>
<h2>Birdsong Whistle</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 85 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Cuckoo bird egg<br />
This carving of reddish soapstone resembles a miniature cardinal. When air is blown through the lower back high-pitched sounds are emitted through the bird’s open beak. When the whistle is blown the sounds of songbirds are heard by all creatures in a 100-foot radius. These calls are indistinguishable from actual birds singing.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to break the whistle to summon a large flock of birds that appear at the start of your next turn and surround you in a 10-foot radius. The flock moves with you and makes you heavily obscured from creatures more than 10 feet away for 1 minute, or until the flock takes 10 or more damage from area effects.</p>
<h2>Blackbird Pie</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Feather from the Dreaming<br />
This item appears to be a freshly baked pie in a tin. When the crust is fully punctured the pie explodes as 24 magic blackbirds fly out and flit through the air in a 20-foot radius for 2d4 rounds, at which point the birds and the pie disappear. A creature that starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on its turn makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1 slashing damage on a failure. A creature damaged by the blackbirds has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the beginning of its next turn. The blackbirds are magical and cannot be interacted with like normal animals, and attacking them has no effect.</p>
<h2>Book of Storing</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 350 gp; requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Beautiful leather bound tome, scroll of <em>major image</em><br />
After you attune to this 1-foot square 6-inch thick book it hides its true nature to anybody else, appearing to be a mundane diary. When you open it, however, the book reveals a Tiny storage compartment.<br />
The storage space is the same size as the book, and because this item doesn’t function as a pocket dimension it can be safely used to store items such as a <em>portable hole</em>.</p>
<h2>Boots of Elvenkind</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 300 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Owlbear hide<br />
These boots cause your steps to make no sound on any surface. While wearing these boots, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to move silently.</p>
<h2>Boots of Levitation</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement; cost 750 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Lodestone brought above the treeline and then down to sea level<br />
While wearing these boots, up to 3 times between long rests you can use an action to cast <em>levitate</em> on yourself.</p>
<h2>Boots of Speed</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 3,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Soles of the shoes worn by the winner of a prestigious race<br />
While wearing these boots, you can use a bonus action to click the heels together. You double your Speed, and opportunity attacks made against you have disadvantage. You can end the effect as a bonus action.<br />
Once the boots have been used in this way for a total of 10 minutes (each use expends a minimum of 1 minute), they cease to function until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h2>Boots of Striding and Springing</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 400 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Athletic wraps worn while joyfully frolicking through a pixie’s flower field or jumping over a deadly drop<br />
While wearing these boots, your Speed increases to 30 feet, unless it is higher, regardless of encumbrance or armor. In addition, your jump distances increase 15 feet vertically and 30 feet horizontally (as the <em>jump</em> spell).</p>
<h2>Boots of the Winterlands</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fur from a winterwolf or yeti<br />
While wearing these boots, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance to cold damage.  </li>
<li>You ignore difficult terrain caused by ice<br />
  or snow.  </li>
<li>You can survive temperatures as low as –50° Fahrenheit (–46° Celsius) without effect, or as low as –100° Fahrenheit (–74° Celsius) with heavy clothes.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Borrower’s Bookmark</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; cost 40 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Recommendation of a good book (the creature making the recommendation must be present for at least 1 hour of the item’s creation time)<br />
A neat strap of embossed leather, the borrower’s bookmark can be placed in a book, allowing it to be stored in an extradimensional space. As an action you can send the book into a pocket dimension. While it is in the pocket dimension, you can use an action to summon it to your hand or an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you unattune from the bookmark while its book is within the pocket dimension, the bookmark reappears on your person, but the book is lost. The bookmark’s magic can’t be used to store anything other than a book.<br />
<strong>Curse.</strong> The borrower’s bookmark is cursed. Books dismissed to the pocket dimension are sent to a powerful entity’s lair. The entity learns all the knowledge contained therein, as well as your identity and location.</p>
<h2>Bottle of Fizz</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 350 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Ruby, ember from the Plane of Fire<br />
When found this thick glass bottle has 25 (5d10) small red rocks inside. You can use an action to throw a red rock to the ground to create a spectacular fireworks show that lasts for 1 round. The fireworks cast bright light for 50 feet and dim light for a further 30 feet, and they can be heard up to 200 feet away.</p>
<h2>Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 3,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Water elemental mote<br />
This heavy glass bowl weighs 3 pounds and can hold 3 gallons of water. While it is filled, you can use an action to summon a water elemental as if you had cast the <em>conjure elemental</em> spell. Once used, you must wait until the next dawn to use it again.</p>
<h2>Box of Bees</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 110 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Queen bee from a hive that has persisted for at least 5 years<br />
Many apprentices play pranks on one another, some of which can be quite painful—the <em>box of bees</em> is a particularly popular example and now sold by those with their own mischievous designs. Each of these wooden boxes is rectangular and approximately 2 inches long. It is usually unadorned, though some boxes seem to have something moving or vibrating inside.<br />
When you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the lid slides open and a bee erupts out of the box to harass a creature of your choice within 20 feet. A creature harassed by the bee must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature makes its next attack roll or ability check with disadvantage.<br />
When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, a dozen or more bees swarm out of the box and attack. A creature attacked by the bees must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute. On a failure, the creature takes 1 point of damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 round.<br />
The box has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the box loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Box of Party Tricks</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pearls, tears of a<br />
puppet master<br />
This box contains 1d12 glowing vials. You can use an action to remove a vial and smash it to the ground, creating a randomly determined effect from the Box of Party Tricks table.</p>

<h2>Bracers of Archery</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Bracer worn by a centaur<br />
Wearing these bracers grants proficiency with the longbow and shortbow, and you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls on ranged attacks made with them.</p>
<h2>Bracers of Defense</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 2,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Portion of a shield worn by a commander to war<br />
Wearing these bracers grants a +2 bonus to AC if you are not wearing armor or a shield.</p>
<h2>Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 3,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Fire elemental mote<br />
While fire burns in this 5 pound brass brazier, you can use an action to summon a fire elemental as if you had cast the <em>conjure elemental</em> spell. Once used, you must wait until the next dawn to use it again.</p>
<h2>Brooch of Shielding</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 450 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Willingly given dragon scale<br />
Wearing this brooch grants resistance to force damage and immunity to the <em>magic missile</em> spell.</p>
<h2>Broom of Flying</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 2500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Roc feathers<br />
While sitting on this ordinary-seeming 3 pound broom, you can speak its command word, allowing you to ride it through the air. The broom can carry up to 200 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed of 20 feet. It deactivates if you land.<br />
You can send the broom up to 1 mile from you by speaking its command word and naming a location you are familiar with. It can also be called back from up to a mile away with a different command word.</p>
<h2>Bubble Wand</h2>
<p><em>Wand, uncommon (cost 120 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Perfectly spherical frozen soap bubble<br />
This slender timber wand has a wooden ring at its tip. The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into a spray of colorful bubbles and is lost forever.<br />
While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend its charges and either create a harmless spray of colorful bubbles (1 charge) or cast the <em>dancing lights</em> cantrip (2 charges). The <em>dancing lights</em> appear as glowing bubbles.<br />
When a creature targets you with an attack while you are holding the wand, you can use your reaction to snap it (destroying the wand). You can do this after the roll is made, but before the outcome of the attack is determined. You gain a +5 bonus to AC and a fly speed of 10 feet as a giant soap bubble coalesces around you. The bubble persists for 1 minute or until you are hit with an attack, at which point it bursts with a loud ‘pop’.</p>
<h2>Cage of Folly</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common, (requires attunement; cost 75 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Remains of a magic item whose crafting check was failed<br />
This small silver or gold birdcage traps your bad ideas and puts them on display. When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, a little piece of a mechanical bird materializes inside the cage: first the feet, then legs, body, wings, and head. You can immediately reconsider and reroll the ability check. The <em>cage of folly</em> can be used once every 24 hours, and recharges at the end of each week.<br />
Once you have used the birdcage 5 times, the bird sings a mocking song for 1 hour when you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check. If you open the birdcage and let the bird go free, it gives you one piece of good advice about a current problem or question that you face. At the Narrator’s discretion, the advice may give you advantage on one ability check made in the next week. Afterward it flies away as the birdcage loses its magic and becomes a mundane item (though some who have released their birds claim to have encountered them again in the wilds later.)</p>
<h2>Candle of Invocation</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 50,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Blood from a divine servant such as an angel or fiend<br />
This golden candle is infused with raw divine magic. When attuned to by a cleric or druid, it takes on a color appropriate to the cleric’s deity.<br />
You can use an action to light the candle and activate its magic, shedding dim light in a 30-foot radius. The candle can burn for a total of 4 hours in 1 minute increments before being used up.<br />
Any creature within the area of the candle’s light who worships the same deity as the attuned creature (or at the Narrator’s discretion, an allied deity) has advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. If such a creature is also a cleric, druid, or herald, they can cast 1st-level spells from one of those classes at that spell level without expending spell slots.<br />
Alternatively, one of these candles that has not yet been lit can be used to cast the <em>gate</em> spell. Doing so consumes the candle.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Candle of the Surreptitious Scholar</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Wax harvested from bees fed lavender nectar<br />
Initially crafted by wizard apprentices trying not to irritate their roommates, these candles became extremely popular with the thieves and other ne’er-do-wells that can afford them (helping some less scrupulous novice mages to afford tuition). The candle has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.<br />
When you speak the command word and use an action to expend 1 charge, the candle’s flame springs to life. Its bluish flame provides bright light within 5 feet and dim light for another 5 feet. The enchantment of the candle is such that the light that it sheds is visible only to you. Each charge is good for 1 hour of illumination, after which the candle winks out.<br />
By expending all 3 charges at once, you can create an effect identical to <em>light</em> except that only you are able to see the light it sheds.<br />
If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the candle loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Cantrip Wand</h2>
<p><em>Wand, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scroll of the cantrip to be imbued and a branch from a treant or awakened tree<br />
This wand can be used as a spellcasting focus and allows you to cast one additional cantrip as if you knew it, as long as it is on your spell list. Each cantrip wand has a cantrip imbued within it upon creation, and will be known by its name (such as a <em>fire bolt wand</em> or <em>light wand</em>).<br />
Other implements exist for the storing of cantrips from other classes (like <em>cantrip holy symbols</em> or <em>cantrip instruments</em>), and though these are wondrous items they function like wands.</p>
<h2>Cape of the Mountebank</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 2,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Brimstone from the lower planes<br />
While wearing this cape, you can use an action to cast <em>dimension door</em> once between long rests. You disappear and reappear in a cloud of smoke which dissipates at the end of your next turn, or sooner if conditions are windy.</p>
<h2>Carpet of Flying</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost varies; see table)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component</strong>: Thread spun on the top of a mountain<br />
You can use an action to speak this carpet’s command word, making it hover and fly. It moves according to your verbal commands as long as you are within 30 feet of it.<br />
These carpets come in four sizes. The Narrator can choose or randomly determine which size a given carpet is.<br />
If the carpet is carrying half its capacity or less, its Speed is doubled.</p>

<p><em>Armor (full plate), very rare (requires attunement; cost 17,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Blessed text, plate armor<br />

<ul>
<li>Your AC increases by 2.  </li>
<li>You count as one size category larger when determining your carrying capacity.  </li>

<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.  </li>
<li>You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks.  </li>

<h2>Censer of Controlling Air Elementals</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 3,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Air elemental mote<br />
While incense burns in this 1 pound censer, you can use an action to summon an air elemental as if you had cast the <em>conjure elemental</em> spell. Once used, you must wait until the next dawn to use it again.</p>
<h2>Charcoal Stick of Aversion</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Forged document that passed bureaucratic scrutiny<br />
As an action, you can expend 1 charge from this charcoal stick to draw an X on one object up to the size of a normal door. This has no effect on creatures, or objects worn by creatures. Creatures other than you that see the marked object roll a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, they do not notice the marked object as anything out of the ordinary from its surroundings. On a success, they can interact with the object normally. A creature that remains in the area and is consciously searching for the kind of object that you have marked receives a new saving throw at the end of each minute. A creature interacting with a marked object automatically reveals it to all creatures who observe the interaction. A charcoal mark lasts for 24 hours or until it is wiped away as an action.<br />
Alternatively, you can expend 2 charges to increase the DC to notice the object to 15.<br />
The charcoal has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk. If you expend the last charge, the charcoal is consumed.</p>
<h2>Chime of Opening</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 750 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Key from a<br />
decommissioned prison<br />
You can use an action to strike this foot-long metal chime while pointing it at an openable object within 120 feet. One lock or other fastening on the object opens if the sound can reach the object.

<h2>Cloak of Displacement</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> The breath of an<br />
invisible stalker<br />
This cloak creates a visual illusion that distorts your position. Attack rolls against you have disadvantage unless the attacker does not rely on sight.

<h2>Cloak of Elvenkind</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 500 gp)</em><br />

<li>Once between long rests you can use an action to cast <em>polymorph</em> on yourself, transforming into a bat. You retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloak of the Manta Ray</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous, uncommon (cost 400 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> A merfolk’s joyous song<br />
While you wear this cloak with its hood up, you gain a swim speed of 60 feet and can breathe water. You can use an action to put the hood up or down.</p>
<h2>Cloak of the Shadowcaster</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Thread from the Plane of Shadow<br />
Shadows writhe underneath this dark cloak. While attuned to and wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light or darkness.<br />
In addition, you can use an action to animate your shadow for up to 1 hour. While it is animated, you can see and hear through your shadow’s senses and control it telepathically. If your shadow is slain while animated, your shadow disappears until the new moon, during which time the cloak becomes nonmagical. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.</p>
<h2>Clockwork Calendar</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> 4 bronze clockwork gears, each one forged during a different season<br />
A circular disk of dozens of interlocking gears almost a foot in diameter, upon first examination this device is unfathomably complex. The gears are covered with runes that appear to be a much older form of Dwarvish script. Rotating some of the raised gears causes this apparatus to slowly tick through a series of symbols that seem to correspond to astrological signs.<br />
To understand how to operate the <em>clockwork calendar</em>, you must carefully study the device and turn the gears through their myriad configurations. After 1 hour you can make a DC 16 Investigation or Arcana check. On a failure, you cannot reach a conclusion regarding how to interpret the intended function of the calendar. On a success, you understand how to utilize the device as indicated below. Casting <em>identify</em> on the calendar reveals a moderate aura of divination magic but provides no information on how to use this complex object.<br />
Once you know how the <em>clockwork calendar</em> functions, you can adjust the dials to display the current day of the year for the geographical region of the world you are located in (this property does not function outside of the Material Plane). The exposed faces of the gears composing the calendar display the position of the stars in the sky and the dials can be adjusted throughout the day or night to continue to track their position. The calendar can also be adjusted to any past or future dates and times to ascertain the position of any of the celestial objects visible in the night sky.<br />
Additionally, you can use a bonus action to smash the <em>clockwork calendar</em> and destroy it, gaining the benefits of the <em>haste</em> spell until the end of your next turn.</p>
<h2>Compendium of Many Colors</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 60 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Vial of nectar from the Dreaming, high quality parchment<br />
This spellbook made from high quality blank parchment is covered in tiny runes. When one of these small inscriptions is pressed the parchment changes color.</p>
<h2>Confidante’s Journal</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (cost 145 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Papyrus made from albino reeds<br />
Living vines hold shut this journal’s cover and part only for you. Your patron can read anything you write in the journal and can cause brief messages to appear on its pages.<br />
If you spend a short or long rest writing your most secret thoughts in the journal, you can choose to gain Inspiration instead of regaining expended Pact Magic spell slots. The seventh time you gain Inspiration in this way, you fill the journal’s pages and can’t write in it again.</p>
<h2>Contract of Indentured Service</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; purchase of the debt for 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Binding contracts of service signed in good faith<br />
Necromancers occasionally act as apparent benefactors, offering loans to victims now in exchange for service after death. This contract details an account of a spirit that has become indentured to the contract’s holder. While holding the contract, you can speak the command word as an action to summon the invisible undead spirit, which functions as the spell <em>unseen servant</em>. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to tear up the contract and release the undead spirit. The spirit appears as a friendly specter you can telepathically command (as a bonus action) for as long as you maintain concentration. The specter acts immediately after your turn. If your concentration is broken, the specter attacks you and your companions. Otherwise the specter disappears 10 minutes after it is summoned, vanishing to whichever afterlife awaits it.</p>
<h2>Cord of Spirit Stealing</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 1,250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> An item that has been used to kill a sapient creature<br />
This leather cord is the color of stained blood and feels slightly moist. When wrapped around the handle of a melee weapon, the cord captures some of the energy of any sapient creature the weapon is used to kill. When you reduce a hostile sapient creature to 0 hit points, the cord gains 1 charge (to a maximum of 5). You can use a bonus action to spend 1 charge from the cord to cast <em>false life</em>, or expend more additional charges to increase the spell’s level to the number of charges expended.</p>
<h2>Crystal Ball</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement; 50,000 gp or 150,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Solid, silver-laced crystal ball (rare) or stone from an aligned plane (legendary)<br />
A typical enchanted <em>crystal ball</em> can be used to cast the <em>scrying</em> spell (save DC 17) once between short rests while touching it.<br />
Three legendary variations exist. In all cases, the legendary variants have an alignment (Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful). If you do not have an alignment trait that matches the <em>crystal ball</em>’s, after using it you take 6d6 psychic damage and gain a level of strife.<br />
<strong>Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.</strong> You can use an action to cast <em>detect thoughts</em> (save DC 17) on a creature within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. This effect does not require concentration, but it ends when the <em>scrying</em> does.<br />
<strong>Crystal Ball of Telepathy.</strong> While the <em>scrying</em> is active, you can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor, and you can use an action to cast <em>suggestion</em> (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of them. This effect does not require concentration, but it ends when the <em>scrying</em> does.<br />
<strong>Crystal Ball of True Seeing.</strong> In addition to the normal benefits of scrying, you gain truesight through the spell’s sensor out to a range of 120 feet.</p>
<h2>Cube of Force</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 4,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Adamantine cube<br />
This inch-long cube has a recessed button with a distinct marking on each face. It starts with 36 charges and regains 1d20 of them at dawn.<br />
You can use an action to press one of the buttons, expending charges as shown on the Cube of Force table. If the cube has insufficient charges, nothing happens.<br />
Otherwise, the cube creates a 15-foot cube of force that is centered on you and moves with you. It lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press another button, or the cube’s charges are depleted.<br />
You can change the cube’s effect by pressing a different button. Doing so expends the requisite number of charges and resets the duration.<br />
If moving causes the cube to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you cannot move any closer to that object while the cube is active.<br />
The cube loses charges when targeted by effects from the following spells or magic items: <em>disintegrate</em> (1d12 charges), <em>horn of blasting</em> (1d10 charges), <em>passwall</em> (1d6 charges), <em>prismatic spray</em> (1d20 charges), <em>wall of fire</em> (1d4 charges).</p>

<h2>Cubic Gate</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (cost 250,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Metal from each of the six planes on the cube<br />
This 3-inch cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. Each side of the cube is keyed to a different plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The other five sides are determined by the Narrator.<br />
As an action, you may press one side of the cube and spend a charge to cast the <em>gate</em> spell, opening a portal to the associated plane. You may instead press a side twice, expending 2 charges and casting <em>plane shift</em> (save DC 17) which sends the targets to the associated plane.</p>
<h2>Culdarath the Ninth Ring’s True Name</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; cost 70 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Parchment charred on the Plane of Fire<br />
This charred parchment slip contains the magically bound name “Ozzacath’ta Culd.” While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke this name to summon a vision of a powerful efreet beside you for 1 minute. Ozzacath is haughty and impatient but seems to relish the chance to burn anything. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.<br />
You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light a bonfire, candle, or similar flammable object within 15 feet.  </li>
<li>Burn brightly (or cease burning brightly) for the next minute, providing bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for a further 15 feet.  </li>
<li>Translate up to 25 words of spoken or written Ignan into Common.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Culdarath in exchange for his direct assistance. When you do so the parchment burns to cinders and for the next minute the vision roars into a ball of fire within 5 feet of you (as <em>flaming sphere</em>, save DC 13). On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally indicate where the ball of fire moves. Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Culdarath’s true name again.</p>
<h2>Cunning Tools</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Silver worked only by the light of the full moon<br />
While using these thieves’ tools you are proficient with them, and you gain an expertise die on checks made to pick locks or disable devices such as traps.<br />
In addition, these thieves’ tools fold down into a single smooth rosewood handle that appears to be a finely polished piece of wood, and you gain an expertise die on checks made to conceal them.</p>
<h2>Dagger of Venom</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (dagger), rare (cost 2,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Mushrooms gathered from a mummy’s tomb<br />
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic blade. In addition, once each dawn you can use an action to poison the dagger’s blade for 1 minute or until it is used to damage a creature. When a creature is damaged by the blade’s poison, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute.</p>
<h2>Dancing Sword</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement; cost 8,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fey-crafted instrument<br />
While you are attuned to this magic sword, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word and throw it into the air. The sword hovers, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it (using your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls). On each of your turns you can use a bonus action to make the sword fly up to 30 feet to attack another creature within 5 feet of it.<br />
After the sword attacks for the fourth time, it tries to return to your hand. It flies 30 feet towards you, moving as close as it can before either being caught in your free hand or falling to the ground.<br />
The sword ceases to hover if you move more than 30 feet away from it or grasp it.</p>
<h2>Death’s Essence Pendant</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Humanoid remains, pearl<br />
This small black pendant has 5 charges and regains 1d4 charges each day at dawn. You can use an action and expend a charge to make undead of CR 1 or lower indifferent to you and creatures you choose within 30 feet of you. Undead remain indifferent until you for up to 1 hour, or until you threaten or harm them. Three times each day you can use a bonus action and expend a charge to summon a <strong>skeleton</strong> (page 334 or <strong>zombie</strong> (page 335). Your summoned creature follows you and is hostile to creatures that are hostile to you. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete. Undead created by the pendant turn into dust at dawn.</p>
<h2>Decanter of Endless Water</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 450 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> water elemental mote<br />
This flask sloshes when shaken as if full of water. You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak a command word, causing undrinkable water to flow out of the flask. It stops at the start of your next turn.<br />
<strong>Stream.</strong> This command word produces 1 gallon of water.<br />
<strong>Fountain.</strong> This command word produces 5 gallons of water.<br />
<strong>Geyser.</strong> This command word produces 30 gallons of water that manifests as a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action, you can aim the geyser at a target within 30 feet, forcing it to succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Any object less than 200 pounds is knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away.</p>
<h2>Deck of Illusions</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> paper made by the fey<br />
This box houses a set of 34 illustrated cards when new. A found deck is typically missing 1d20 cards.<br />
As an action, you can draw a random card (one manually selected does nothing) and throw it up to 30 feet from you.<br />
Upon landing, the card creates an illusion of one or more creatures. These illusions are of normal size for the creatures depicted and act normally, but are insubstantial and harmless. While you are within 120 feet of the illusion, you can use an action to move it anywhere within 30 feet from its card.<br />
The illusions are revealed to a creature when it uses an action to make a DC 15 Investigation check or automatically upon any physical interaction. Once revealed, an illusion becomes translucent.<br />
The illusion lasts until its card is moved or it is dispelled. In either case the card disappears and cannot be reused.</p>

<h2>Deck of Many Things</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (cost 100,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Deck of cards touched by a god or goddess of luck and essence from a chaotic plane<br />
Most <em>Decks of Many Things</em> have only 13 cards, but some have 22. The Narrator may decide, or roll 1d4 to determine randomly (a partial deck on a 1–3, or a full deck on a 4).<br />
Before drawing, you must declare the number of cards that you intend to draw. A modified poker deck can be used to create your own physical deck using the substitutions below. A card’s magic takes effect as soon as it is drawn. Once you begin drawing, each subsequent card must be drawn within an hour of the card that came before it. Failure to do so causes all of your remaining draws to take effect immediately. Once a card is drawn, if it is not a joker it is reshuffled into the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.<br />
Once you have drawn the number of cards that you’ve declared, the deck resets and you may never draw from that deck again. Once all individuals present when the deck is discovered have drawn their cards, roll 1d4. On a 1–3 the deck vanishes, or on a 4 it returns to its coffer, allowing you to transport it should you so choose.<br />
The Balance, Comet, Donjon, Fates, Fool, Gem, Idiot, Talons, and Vizier cards only appear in the 22 card deck.<br />
<strong>♣ Ace of Clubs: Talons.</strong> Every magical item that you own is immediately destroyed. Artifacts are not destroyed and are instead cast into the multiverse.<br />
<strong>♣ King of Clubs: Void.</strong> Your soul is trapped in an object in a location of the Narrator’s choosing where it is guarded by powerful beings. While your soul is trapped, your body is incapacitated. A wish cannot restore your soul, but it can reveal its location. Any remaining draws from the deck are lost.<br />
<strong>♣ Queen of Clubs: Flames.</strong> You gain the enmity of a powerful devil. It seeks to destroy you along with all that you love or have built, inflicting as much misery upon you and your loved ones as possible before finally slaying you. This antagonism lasts until either you or the devil perish.<br />
<strong>♣ Jack of Clubs: Skull.</strong> A harbinger of death appears and attempts to slay you. The harbinger appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet and immediately attacks. A sense of mortal dread fills any allies present, warning them to stay away. The harbinger fights until you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. It cannot be harmed by anyone other than you, and if anyone other than you attempts to harm it, another harbinger of death is summoned for them. Creatures slain by a harbinger cannot be restored to life by any means.<br />
<strong>♣ Two of Clubs: Idiot.</strong> Your Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 1d4 + 1, to a minimum of 1. You may draw one additional card beyond what you declared.<br />
<strong>♦ Ace of Diamonds: Vizier.</strong> At any point within a year of drawing this card, you may ask a question and immediately receive a truthful answer that helps you to solve a problem or dilemma as well as the wisdom and the knowledge to apply it.<br />
<strong>♦ King of Diamonds: Sun.</strong> You gain 50,000 XP, and a randomly determined wondrous item appears in your hands.<br />
<strong>♦ Queen of Diamonds: Moon.</strong> You are granted 1d3 wishes (as the <em>wish</em> spell).<br />
<strong>♦ Jack of Diamonds: Star.</strong> Increase an ability score of your choice by 2. The score cannot exceed 24.<br />
<strong>♦ Two of Diamonds: Comet.</strong> Defeating the next hostile monster or group alone will grant you enough experience points to advance to the next level.<br />
<strong>♥ Ace of Hearts: Fates.</strong> You are granted the ability to circumvent or erase a single event as though it had never happened. You may use this ability immediately upon drawing the card or at any point prior to your death.<br />
<strong>♥ King of Hearts: Throne.</strong> You are granted proficiency in the Persuasion skill and gain a 1d6 expertise die on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks. You are also granted legal domain over a small keep or fortress on the plane that your character inhabits. Your new domain is overrun by monsters and must be liberated before it can be inhabited.<br />
<strong>♥ Queen of Hearts: Key.</strong> A magic weapon of at least rare rarity that you are proficient with appears in your hand. The weapon is chosen by the Narrator.<br />
<strong>♥ Jack of Hearts: Knight.</strong> A veteran appears and offers you their loyal service until death, believing it to be destiny. You control this character.<br />
<strong>♥ Two of Hearts: Gem.</strong> You are showered in wealth. A total of 25 trinkets, easily portable pieces of art, or jewelry worth 2,000 gold each, or 50 gems worth 1,000 gold each appear directly in front of you.<br />
<strong>♠ Ace of Spades: Donjon.</strong> You vanish and are trapped in an extradimensional space. You are either unconscious in a sphere (50%) or trapped in a nightmare realm drawn from your own experiences and fears (50%). You remain in your prison until you are freed. While divination magics cannot locate you, a <em>wish</em> spell reveals the location of your prison. You cannot draw any more cards.<br />
<strong>♠ King of Spades: Ruin.</strong> All nonmagical wealth that you own is lost. Material items vanish. Property and other holdings are lost along with any documentation. You are destitute.<br />
<strong>♠ Queen of Spades: Euryale.</strong> You are cursed by the card. You suffer a permanent –2 penalty to all saving throws. Only a god or the Fates Card can end this curse.<br />
<strong>♠ Jack of Spades: Rogue.</strong> A trusted ally, friend, or other NPC (chosen by the Narrator) becomes a bitter enemy, although their identity is not revealed. They will act against you based upon their abilities and resources, and will try to utterly destroy you. Only a <em>wish</em> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility.<br />
<strong>♠ Two of Spades: Balance.</strong> Your history rewrites itself. You gain a randomly determined background, replacing your background feature with the new background feature. You do not change the skill proficiencies or ability score increases from your previous background, or gain new skill proficiencies or ability score increases.<br />
<strong>Joker with Trademark: Fool.</strong> You lose 10,000 xp and must immediately draw again. If the experience lost in this manner would cause you to lose a level, you are instead reduced to the beginning of your current level.<br />
<strong>Joker without Trademark: Jester.</strong> Fortune smiles on the foolish. Either gain 10,000 XP or draw twice more from the deck beyond what you declared.</p>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Heart of an ancient dragon<br />
You gain +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword. In addition, while you are attuned to the sword, on each of your turns before you make your first attack with it you can transfer some or all of the +3 bonus to your Armor Class (instead of using it for attacks) until the start of your next turn or until you drop the sword (whichever comes first).</p>

<strong>Cursed.</strong> You cannot remove this armor until you are targeted by <em>remove curse</em> or similar magic. You have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws made against them.</p>
<h2>Describing Gremlins</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (gear gremlins), uncommon (cost 225 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components</strong>: Scroll of <em>enlarge/reduce</em><br />
This little porcelain chair has a Tiny ethereal purple goblinoid sitting on it, and in the creature’s hands sits another even smaller purple goblinoid, and in their hands sits an even smaller goblinoid, and so on.<br />
This item includes 10 gremlins of decreasing scale from the largest at 4 inches tall, to the smallest that’s roughly the size of an amoeba.<br />
If you place a single drop of a substance in front of the series of gremlins, the largest of them leans towards it and allows the smaller gremlins a minute to observe the drop’s contents at a cellular level. The smallest gremlin explains to the next size up, and so on, with the largest gremlin communicating back to you the description of the contents at a cellular level.<br />
The gremlins are not particularly intelligent so most of their descriptions are similar to “<em>some sorta green globs</em>” or “<em>a buncha squidgy spiny things what tried to eat me</em>”.<br />
Although this information is not scientifically or medically helpful, it can easily be used to identify if a substance is the same as another previously observed substance as the gremlins are consistent in their descriptions.</p>
<h2>Devil’s Eye Ring</h2>
<p><em>Ring, rare (cost 1,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Eye of a devil received through bargaining<br />
This silver ring contains the sentient eye of a devil. While you are wearing the ring and it is uncovered, you have disadvantage on Persuasion checks but gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks.<br />

As an action, you can remove the shackles, as can any creature you designate when you use them. After every 2 weeks that passes, a shackled creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check to break free and destroy the shackles.</p>
<h2>Draconic Diorama</h2>

The skeleton stands in a different position each time the box is examined but it does not move while being observed.<br />
While you carry the diorama, you have advantage on saving throws against Frightful Presence.<br />
A successful DC 13 Arcana or Nature check reveals the skeleton is an actual dragon skeleton that has been shrunk to fit inside the box.<br />

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Bowl used to collect alms or tithes for a religious organization<br />
This terra cotta pottery bowl is sized to be used as a nightstand washbowl. When you are attuned to the bowl and fill it with holy water, the reflection on its surface portrays your most recent dream, or the dream of a sleeping creature within your reach. If the water is disturbed the shown dream disappears and will not return.<br />
Alternatively, you can shatter the bowl and choose one sleeping creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the sleeping creature awakens naturally, its dream and sleep cannot be interrupted or effected by any other magic.</p>
<h2>Dust of Disappearance</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pixie dust<br />
This shimmering dust is usually found in a small vial that contains enough for a single use. You can use an action to scatter the dust into the air, covering you and each creature and object within 10 feet and rendering them invisible for 2d4 minutes. This consumes the dust. If an affected creature casts a spell or attacks, the effect ends for that creature.</p>
<h2>Dust of Dryness</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Mote of elemental earth<br />
This small vial contains 1d6+4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to spread a pinch over water, transforming a 15-foot cube of water into a small pellet that weighs less than an ounce.<br />
Using an action, you or another creature can break the pellet against any hard surface, releasing all of the water and destroying the pellet.<br />
A creature composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.</p>
<h2>Dust of Sneezing and Choking</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Feywood pollen<br />
This fine gray dust is usually found in a vial and appears to be <em>dust of disappearance,</em> even when magic is used to <em>identify</em> it. Each vial contains enough for a single use.<br />
You can use an action to throw the dust into the air. You and creatures within 30 feet of you that breathe make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become wracked with violent coughing and sneezing, becoming incapacitated and beginning to suffocate. While conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on a success. A <em>lesser restoration</em> spell also ends the effects.</p>
<h2>Dwarven Plate</h2>
<p><em>Armor (full plate), very rare (cost 20,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Iron of elemental earth that has not seen the light of the sun or moon<br />

<h2>Dwarven Thrower</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf; cost 18,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Iron hammer struck by a storm giant’s lightning<br />

In addition, while you are attuned to the hammer, you may throw it with a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet. On a hit with a ranged attack using this hammer it deals an extra 1d8 damage (2d8 damage if the target is a giant). When thrown the warhammer immediately flies back to your hand after it hits or misses its target.</p>
<h2>Earth Charm</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (charm), uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pebble from the land’s deepest chasm<br />
While wearing this charm you gain an expertise die on checks and saving throws to avoid falling prone, or you can break the charm to release its power, destroying it to activate one of the following effects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abase:</strong> As an action, choose a creature you can see within 200 feet. It must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or its flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). An affected airborne creature falls, taking damage when it lands (maximum 8d6 bludgeoning damage).  </li>
<li><strong>Reshape:</strong> Cast <em>stone shape</em>.  </li>
<li><strong>Withdraw:</strong> Cast <em>meld into stone</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Releasing the charm’s power attracts the attention of a divi who seeks you out to demand your service.</p>
<h2>Echo Force</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (shortsword), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Shards from a shattered <em>magic mirror</em><br />
While you are attuned to and wielding this shortsword and at your hit point maximum, instead of making a melee weapon attack you can strike at the air to create a blade of magical force. Your blades of magical force are ranged spell attacks that use Strength or Dexterity (your choice), have a range of 30/60 ft., and deal 1d6 force damage. When you are not at your hit point maximum, this shortsword becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Efficient Quiver</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Canvas or fine leather<br />
This quiver has three compartments that contain extradimensional spaces. The first compartment can hold up to 60 arrows or items of a similar size.

You can retrieve any item as if it were being drawn from a regular quiver or scabbard. No single item can weigh more than 2 pounds.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Efreeti Bottle</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost 20,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Adamantine, brass ingots from the Plane of Fire<br />
You can use an action to unstopper this intricately carved brass bottle, causing an efreeti to appear in a cloud of smoke in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. When you open the bottle, roll to d100 to determine the effect.</p>

<h2>Elemental Gem</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Diamond, corundum, emerald, or sapphire<br />
You can use an action to break this gem, summoning an elemental to you as if you had cast the <em>conjure elemental</em> spell. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned. The gem loses its enchantment when broken.</p>

<h2>Elemental Quiver</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 1,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Jewel of the specified type<br />
When you place one or more pieces of nonmagical ammunition into this bejeweled leather quiver, after 1 hour each is imbued with elemental power determined by the gem used in its construction. An elementally-imbued piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d4 elemental damage (see Table: Elemental Quiver). The enchantment begins to fade after the ammunition is removed from the quiver and vanishes entirely after 1 minute. Each piece of ammunition imbued with elemental power expends 1 charge from the quiver. The quiver has 20 charges and regains 1d4+2 charges each dawn.</p>

<h2>Elven Chain</h2>
<p><em>Armor (chain shirt), rare (cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Mithral worked on a fire born from the bark from an awakened tree<br />
While wearing this armor your Armor Class increases by +1, and you are able to wear it without penalty even without proficiency. It only weighs 10 pounds, including the padding underneath, and can be stealthily worn under normal clothes.</p>
<h2>Emperor’s Blade</h2>
<p><em>Weapon, very rare (cost 9,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Chain devil’s chains<br />
Spiked metal barbs line this <em>+1 longsword</em>, resembling the many rows of a shark’s teeth. You can use a bonus action to speak a command word that activates or deactivates the barbs. While activated, the barbs rapidly saw back and forth to tear into your foes, making your weapon attacks with the sword deal an extra 1d8 slashing damage.<br />
When you score a critical hit while the barbs are active, the sawing barbs leave a terrible wound that deals 1d8 ongoing damage. At the start of each of its turns, a wounded creature makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to end the ongoing damage.</p>
<h2>Enchanted Music Sheet</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 55 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Noted praises to a composer (the composer must be present for at least 1 hour of the item’s creation time)<br />
This music sheet of fine parchment documents musical notation of a fey performance. Humming, whistling, or using an instrument to play the opening three notes causes the sheet music to issue the sounds of a hauntingly beautiful musical performance for 10 minutes. Up to 6 creatures of your choice that are within 30 feet of the sheet and able to hear the entire performance gain 2 temporary hit points. A creature can’t gain temporary hit points from the music sheet again until it completes a long rest, and after using this feature you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<br />
During a short rest, you can spend an hour to amend the music sheet with pen and ink to alter its melody and mood. Regardless of the changes you make to the sheet, the notation remains legible and the music is always lovely.<br />
If you accompany the music, using an instrument or singing with a DC 12 Performance check, you can empower its magic. Up to 6 creatures of your choice that are within 30 feet of you and able to hear the entire performance regain 3 hit points and gain 6 temporary hit points. At the end of the performance, the music sheet transforms into a flutter of petals and butterflies, and its magic is lost.<br />
<strong>Curse.</strong> The music sheet is cursed and a creature with temporary hit points gained by its music has disadvantage on saving throws to resist being charmed and frightened by celestials, fiends, and fey. Empowering the magic with your own performance draws the attention of a fey who seeks you out to perform at an event of their choosing.</p>
<h2>Essay on Efficient Armor Management</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 80 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Notes on the use of armor from a dozen retired adventurers<br />
This treatise details techniques for how to quickly handle armor. Spending 1 hour over 3 days memorizing the essay’s techniques teaches you how to use an action to doff light and medium armors. The parchment then becomes a mundane item for a year and a day before it regains its magic.</p>
<h2>Ever-Shifting Map</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 100 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Nugget of precious metal or stone mined during a prospector’s final expedition<br />
Created by a dwarven prospector who made it his life’s goal to map out as many of the deepest dungeons and tunnels as he possibly could, this tattered piece of parchment has a display of words and diagrams on it that is in constant flux. When you attune to the map, the words change to the language of your choosing. Whenever you examine the map, you can immediately find north no matter where you are, so long as you are on a plane of existence that has traditional cardinal directions.<br />
When you speak a command word etched on the back corner of the map while you are underground, you recall the memory of the dwarven prospector embarking on what he feared to be his last expedition, delving so deep that he thought he might never return. When this happens, the map shows you the direction to the largest cache of treasure (measured in number of coins and jewels) within 1 mile. The map shows you passageways relevant to your destination and gives you advantage on ability checks to find secret doors, but does not note the location of monsters or traps. The information on the map disappears after your next long rest, at which point all writing vanishes from the parchment and it becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Eversmoking Bottle</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Magma mephit cinders<br />
This glass bottle is filled with whirling smoke. You can use an action to remove the stopper, causing a thick cloud to pour out and fill a 60-foot radius centered on the bottle, making the area heavily obscured. The cloud grows by 10 feet for each minute that the bottle remains open, to a maximum radius of 120 feet.<br />
The cloud remains until the bottle is closed. Closing the bottle requires the item’s command word and an action, after which the smoke disperses after 10 minutes. Moderate winds disperse the smoke after 1 minute. Strong winds disperse the smoke after 1 round.</p>
<h2>Eyes of Charming</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Nymph tears<br />
These framed lenses are worn over the eyes and contain 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the <em>charm person</em> spell (save DC 13). Both you and the target must be able to see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges at dawn.</p>
<h2>Eyes of Minute Seeing</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 200 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fine lenses<br />
These wire-framed lenses are worn over the eyes and enhance your vision within 1 foot. You gain advantage on any sight-based Investigation checks made to study an object or area within that range</p>
<h2>Eyes of the Eagle</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fine lenses<br />
These wire-framed lenses fit over the eyes and grant you advantage on sight-based Perception checks. When visibility is clear you can make out fine details at extreme ranges, easily discerning creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.</p>
<h2>Excalibur</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement; cost 150,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Metal blessed by spirits of nature representing each element<br />
This legendary weapon is said to grant powerful magic to its wielder and that only the rightful ruler of the land is suitable to carry it into battle. While you are attuned to it, Excalibur grants you the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are the rightful wielder of <em>Excalibur</em>, it instantly attunes to you and does not take up an attunement slot.  </li>
<li>You gain a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  </li>
<li>When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target.  </li>
<li>When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target’s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the Narrator. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.  </li>
<li>You can speak the sword’s command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.  </li>
<li>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this property again until you finish a long rest.  </li>
<li>You have advantage on Insight and Persuasion checks made against anyone but creatures you consider to be your close allies and companions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Excalibur’s Scabbard</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 55,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Leather blessed by spirits of nature representing each element<br />
While wearing this longsword scabbard, you have resistance to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>
<h2>Explorer’s Chalk</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> 2 fossilized bones excavated from digs at least 1,000 miles apart<br />
This unassuming piece of white chalk appears well-used but does not wear down no matter how many times it marks a surface. The <em>explorer’s chalk</em> has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges each dawn. When you touch it to a surface, you can expend 1 of its charges to create a mark that cannot be wiped away or obscured for 24 hours. While holding the chalk, you can use an action to become aware of the direction of the closest mark made with it as long as that mark is within 1 mile.<br />
If you expend the <em>explorer’s chalk’s</em> last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the chalk crumbles to dust. On a 20, the chalk regains its expended charges and its number of charges increases by 1.</p>
<h2>Faerie Love Letter</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; a secret worth at least 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Secrets kept by two different fey creatures<br />
This miniature private correspondence, which smells of floral perfume, is proof of a particularly scandalous dalliance between two noble fey which you can exploit for a favor. While attuned to the letter you can whisper the command word to cast either <em>druidcraft</em> or <em>mending</em>. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to summon a Tiny faerie (AC 15, HP 1, Speed fly 30 ft., spell save DC 12). The faerie is charmed by you and acts immediately, casting one of the following spells as directed: <em>faerie fire</em>, <em>healing word</em>, or <em>hideous laughter</em>, after which it acts to preserve its own life and will only take the Dodge or Hide actions. If the faerie dies in your service the letter loses its power, but you retain the proof of misconduct. Otherwise the faerie disappears after 1 minute, taking its love letter with it.</p>
<h2>Family Scrapbook</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> 3 items of sentimental value received from different generations of the same family<br />
This scrapbook contains the legacy of campaigns undertaken by adventurers in days past. When in need of advice, you can open the leather-bound tome and spend 1 minute looking for a similar situation. Roll a d10 and on a 7 or higher, you learn one fact relevant to the situation. On a failure, you instead learn one fact or piece of advice that is irrelevant to the situation (such as “<em>a group of tigers is called an ambush</em>,” or “<em>you should eat more leafy greens</em>”). Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.<br />
Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to rapidly find one tale of questing relevant to your situation and rip it out of the book. Choose one 1st-level spell that has a casting time of 1 action from any class spell list. Before the end of your next turn, you can cast this spell without the need for material components. After a page is torn from the tome in this way, it becomes a mundane scrapbook.</p>
<h2>Fathomer’s Ring</h2>
<p><em>Ring (patron token), common (cost 85 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fish hook plucked from the mouth of a shark or huge aquatic creature<br />
This ring reeks of muck dredged from the ocean floor. While you wear it, you automatically know the depth of any body of water you can see.<br />
As an action, you can cause one submerged, unattended object up to Huge size to rise to the surface of the water at a rate of 500 feet per round. You don’t need to be able to see the object you affect, but you must be familiar with it or at least possess a general description of it. Once the object reaches the water’s surface, it floats there for 1 hour or until you use another action to return it to its resting place. Once you’ve used the ring in this way, it loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Feather Token</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost varies)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Magically-infused silver<br />
This small silver charm resembles a feather. Many types of feather tokens exist with different effects. The Narrator chooses or randomly determines the type of feather token found by rolling d100.</p>

You can use an action to direct the boat to turn up to 90 degrees. Up to 32 medium creatures and their equipment can travel comfortably on the boat (Large creatures count as 4 creatures and Huge creatures count as 8 creatures).

<h2>Figurine of Shared Affliction</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Needle used to suture at least a dozen major injuries<br />
This small wooden figurine was crafted by a healer whose magic allowed him to absorb other people’s afflictions into his own body. The item changes shape, taking on your rough appearance when you attune to it. While carrying the figurine on your person, you have advantage on the first Medicine check you make to treat a disease or poison. Only one creature per day can use the figurine in this manner. When you successfully treat an affliction, the figurine takes on a sickly visage as it absorbs the disease or poison. The <em>figurine of shared affliction</em> grants no benefits until it returns to its normal appearance at the end of your next long rest.<br />
When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to relive the last memory of the healer who created the totem, in which they gave their life to absorb a deadly illness that infected their kin. When this happens, for the next minute you have advantage on death saves. The figurine shows the effects of the attacks you’ve suffered in gruesome detail before reverting to a featureless wooden carving and forever losing its magic.</p>
<h2>Figurine of Wondrous Power</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous Item, rarity by figurine (cost varies)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Varies<br />
These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.<br />
If you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw a figurine at an unoccupied space within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material.<br />
The resulting creature is friendly to you and your companions, with a notable exception listed below. It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.<br />
Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a duration specific to each creature, as detailed in its entry.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Finder Gremlin</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (gear gremlin), common (cost 20 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Compass broken in anger<br />
This tiny ethereal silver goblinoid sits in a clamshell container along with a miniature cup of water and a single thin needle. When prompted with a bonus action, the gremlin uses the cup and needle to try and find magnetic north, although it is not particularly good at this. Whenever the gremlin tries to find true north, roll a d10, and on a result of a 1 it gets confused, pointing in the exact opposite direction instead.</p>
<h2>Fire Charm</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (charm), uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Coin found in ruins beneath a lava flow<br />
While wearing this charm you can use an action to light or extinguish a candle-sized flame within 5 feet, or you can break the charm to release its power, destroying it to activate one of the following effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleanse: Cast <em>lesser restoration</em>.  </li>
<li>Resist: Cast <em>protection from energy</em> (fire only).  </li>
<li>Scorch: Cast <em>scorching ray</em> at 3rd-level (+7 spell attack bonus).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Releasing the charm’s power attracts the attention of an efreeti who seeks you out to demand a gift.</p>
<h2>Fizzy Lifter</h2>
<p><em>Potion, common (cost 85 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Brown sugar boiled by a dragon’s breath<br />
This glass bottle contains a brown bubbly liquid and bears a winking wizard on the label. When you are unconscious and have at least 1 hit point, if another creature forces you to sniff this powerful concoction you immediately wake up.<br />
Alternatively, when you consume this potion you are targeted by the <em>levitate</em> spell (save DC 14) but are also comically bloated with bubbles, taking a −2 penalty to Constitution saving throws for the duration.</p>
<h2>Fizzy Rocks</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Secret whispered into raw cane sugar<br />
This paper packet bearing a winking wizard’s face contains a dozen brightly colored sugary pebbles that fizz when eaten. When you consume a piece of this candy, you can use a bonus action to throw your voice to any point you can see within 60 feet, and your voice emanates directly from that point until the start of your next turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.<br />
Alternatively, you can consume all 12 <em>fizzy rocks</em> to cast <em>thunderwave</em> as a 2nd-level spell (dealing 2d8 thunder damage; save DC 14). You are made an additional target of the spell when casting it in this way.</p>
<p><strong>Fizzy Lifter and Fizzy Rocks</strong><br />
The combination of these two confections are rumored to result in an effect that is ambiguous but indescribably bad. If an adventurer ignores the warning and consumes both items at once this optional effect may be used:<br />
When a creature consumes both <em>fizzy lifter</em> and <em>fizzy rocks</em> within a minute of each other, the arcane chemical reaction causes the effects of both items to end and a torrent of harmless foam to rocket out of the creature’s mouth, propelling it in the opposite direction. Determine a direction randomly by rolling a d8. The creature is pushed 100 feet in that direction. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. If it impacts a creature or object along this path it stops, is knocked prone, and takes 23 (5d8) bludgeoning damage, dealing the same amount of damage to whatever it impacts.</p>
<h2>Flame Tongue</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> A written contract with a devil or other extraplanar and fiery entity<br />
While you are attuned to this magic sword, you can use a bonus action and speak its command word to set the sword alight, shedding bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While lit, attacks using the sword deal an extra 2d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to put them out or until you drop or sheathe the sword.</p>
<h2>Flask of Inebriation</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 90 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Last copper piece to a drunkard’s name<br />
This plain and rough old steel flask hides one’s vices most inconspicuously. Any liquid poured into the flask instantly becomes intoxicating and remains so even if poured out of the flask. The flask has no effect on any form of magical liquids poured into it.<br />
The flask has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge, spraying a 10-foot cone that empties the flask of its contents. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned by the potent alcohol. At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned by the flask can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the flask loses its potency and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Flicker Dagger</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Sharpened bones of a doppelganger<br />
While you are attuned to and wielding this dagger, you can use a bonus action to summon a flickering illusion for 1 minute. Your flickering illusion shares your space, moves with you, and is treated as another enemy of the target for the purposes of the Sneak Attack feature, but it cannot be targeted with attacks and provides no penalties to creatures attacking you. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h2>Focusing Eye</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Cockatrice eye jelly<br />
This thumb-sized opal is carved to resemble an open eye. As an action, you can affix it to your forehead where it remains in place until you use another action to remove it. While you wear the eye, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks you make while speaking telepathically with another creature.<br />
The eye has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk. You can use an action to expend 2 charges and cast <em>detect thoughts</em> on any creature with whom you have communicated telepathically during the last 24 hours, regardless of your distance from the creature. Alternatively, you can expend 3 charges to cast <em>clairvoyance</em> centered on the creature’s current location.<br />
When you expend the eye’s last charge, it permanently affixes to your forehead but otherwise becomes a normal opal.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Folding Boat</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 4,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Wooden box that has soaked in blessed seawater for 7 days and nights<br />
This dark wood box with nautical-themed carvings measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and always floats in water. Three command words control its functions as follows:<br />
The first command word turns the box into a four-person sailboat equipped with sail, oars, and anchor. It is 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep.<br />
The second command word causes the box to unfold into a 24-foot longship that is 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep. This ship has a deck, rowing seats, 5 sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. It can hold 15 Medium creatures comfortably.<br />
A third command word causes the folding boat to revert to its original shape, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain outside and any objects that can fit inside do.<br />
When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.</p>
<h2>Friendly Joybuzzer</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Joyful tears cried from a successful practical joke<br />
This tin ring houses a small circular device with a red button. You have advantage on Sleight of Hand checks made to hide the <em>friendly joybuzzer</em>. Once you are attuned to this magic item, whenever a creature presses the button (even inadvertently through a handshake) for the next minute it becomes happier and friendlier towards you. For the duration, you gain an expertise die on Charisma checks against the creature. If the creature sees the joybuzzer being used or recognizes it as a magical item, it immediately realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and may become hostile toward you.<br />
Alternatively, once you are attuned to this magic item, while you are shaking hands with a creature you can choose to destroy the <em>friendly joybuzzer</em>. Make a melee spell attack with advantage, using your highest mental ability score as your spellcasting ability score. On a successful hit, you target the creature as if you had cast <em>shocking grasp</em>, treating each damage die as if you had rolled the maximum amount.</p>
<h2>Frost Brand</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement; cost 8,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Ice chipped from the highest point of a frost giant’s castle<br />
When exposed to freezing temperatures the blade of this magic sword sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. While you are attuned to the sword, attacks using it deal an extra 1d6 cold damage and you gain resistance to fire damage. Once per hour, when you draw the sword you can choose to extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet.</p>
<h2>Frost Giant’s Plate</h2>
<p><em>Armor, very rare (cost 15,600 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Teeth of an ice giant<br />
With only a thought you can make this fist-sized ball of jagged ice expand to encase your body in a frigid suit of plate armor constructed out of solid black ice. As a bonus action, you can reduce the armor to a 5 pound ball of ice which never melts, or expand the ice back into the suit of armor. While wearing this plate armor you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and resistance to cold damage, and once per day you can double your size (as the <em>enlarge/reduce</em> spell) for 10 minutes.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Gallow Hand</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 110 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Corpse of a humanoid creature that died by hanging<br />
This grisly trophy is the hand of a person hung at the gallows, dipped in wax rendered from their own fat and wicked with their own hair. The fingers can be lit just like a normal candle to shed bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for a further 10 feet. The light shed by a <em>gallow hand</em> is only visible to its holder and is completely invisible to all other creatures.<br />
Alternatively, all five fingers of the hand can be lit as an action. If the hand is lit in this way, it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for a further 20 feet. This light is invisible to the holder but visible to all other creatures. Any creature other than the holder that enters this area of light for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. While charmed, a creature’s Speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. Once lit in this way the <em>gallow hand</em> burns for 1 minute, after which it deteriorates into a molten nub.</p>
<h2>Gauntlets of Ogre Power</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 400 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pair of ogre teeth<br />
Wearing these gauntlets increases your Strength score to 19. They have no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 19.</p>
<h2>Gauntlets of Summer</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 2,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Leather from a white stag<br />
These finely crafted gold-embossed white leather gauntlets are shaped to mimic the hooves of a stag. While wearing these bracers, your weapon attacks count as both silver and magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to attacks and damage.</p>
<h2>Gem of Brightness</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 900 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fire beetle gland, gemstone<br />
This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:<br />
The first command word can be used as a bonus action to cause the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend any charges and lasts until you repeat the first command word or use one of the other two.<br />
The second command word requires an action and expends 1 charge, causing the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br />
The third command word requires an action and expends 5 charges, causing the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
<p>When all of the gem’s charges are expended it loses all magical properties, becoming a mundane jewel worth 50 gold.</p>
<h2>Gem of Seeing</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Lens used by a creature with truesight<br />
This gem has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. You can use an action to speak the gem’s command word and expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have truesight out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.</p>
<h2>Ghost Metal Axe</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (axe), very rare (requires attunement; cost 18,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Bars of metal blessed by a god of death’s priest<br />
While you are attuned to and wielding this extremely light axe, you are able to see 20 feet into the Ethereal Plane and use it to make melee weapon attacks against creatures on the Ethereal Plane. If you are on the Ethereal Plane, you are able to see 20 feet into the Material Plane and use the axe to make melee weapon attacks against creatures on the Material Plane.<br />
In addition, once per turn when you take the Attack action, you can strike at an undead possessing another creature, forcing it to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or exit the possessed creature.</p>
<h2>Giant Slayer</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any axe or sword), rare (cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Beans that have spent at least 1 year in a druid’s grove<br />
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 2d6 damage against giants (including any creature with the giant type, such as ettins and trolls). In addition, when the weapon deals damage to a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.</p>
<h2>Glamoured Padded Leather</h2>
<p><em>Armor (leather), uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Original script of a<br />
prestigious play<br />
While wearing this armor your Armor Class increases by +1, and you can use a bonus action to make the armor appear to be any normal set of clothing or other kind of armor. The illusion allows you to choose the details of its appearance, and it lasts until you remove the armor or use the property again.</p>
<h2>Glasses of Rodentius</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 130 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Preserved corpse of a rat that died of old age after being raised from birth by the item crafter<br />
Engraved into the arms of these green-tinted glasses are very subtle rodents arranged into a helix. While you are wearing the glasses, you can see the paths that rodents have traveled in the last two days. The paths appear as shimmering green lines that reach upwards. The sooner a rat has traveled the path, the brighter the trail appears. When observed under the effects of <em>detect magic</em>, a small spectral rat crawls off of the glasses and squeaks.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to snap the glasses in half and cast <em>charm monster</em> (save DC 13) on up to 10 rats you can see within range. Unlike normal, the duration of the spell is reduced to 1 minute.</p>
<h2>Glass Ring</h2>
<p><em>Ring, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Ring stolen from a<br />
career criminal<br />
Though glass is expensive and not found in all buildings, breaking a window is a common aspect of burglary—a dangerous part if there are guards to worry about. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to make the hand and arm wearing the ring pass through a single pane of glass for 2d4 + 2 rounds. Objects that you hold in that hand also pass through the glass. If your hand or arm are still through the glass at the end of the duration, you take 1d10 slashing damage as the glass breaks.<br />
Alternatively, when you hit a creature made of glass or crystal with a melee attack using the hand wearing the ring, you can command the ring to shatter. The hit deals an additional 2d8 damage.<br />
The ring has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the ring loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Glove of Swift Return</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 200 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Phase monster’s skin<br />

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Ceremonial gloves worn by an adept<br />
While wearing these gloves, when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, as long as you have a free hand. If the damage is reduced to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough to be held in that hand.</p>
<h2>Gloves of Swimming and Climbing</h2>

<h2>Goblin Mask</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 12,750 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Symbol of goblinoid power passed down through at least 10 generations<br />
Your vision shifts into a sickly yellow tint. Your muscles tense up and contract inside you, made twitchy as new sensory information floods your brain. You gain the following benefits and powers while wearing the <em>goblin mask</em>:<br />
<strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You gain darkvision to 60 feet.<br />
<strong><em>Goblin Tongue.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Goblin as a language.<br />
<strong><em>Nimble Escape.</em></strong> This mask has 5 charges.

<h2>Goggles of Night</h2>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Piece of jewelry stolen from a rival<br />
The days of wondering what the socialites across the room are chatting about have come to an end! This brass earring is sculpted into the shape of whispering maidens. Whenever a creature says your name while within 100 feet the earring activates, transmitting the creature’s words as a hushed whisper into your ears until the creature has gone at least 1 minute without saying your name.</p>
<h2>Grappling Gun</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost 25,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Two <em>ropes of climbing</em><br />
This device resembles a crossbow loaded with a grappling hook. You can use an action to fire it at a perch within 120 feet—a crux of tree boughs, the corner of a building,etc.—and make a ranged weapon attack roll against AC 13. On a hit the device’s grappling hook affixes itself to the perch and you can use a bonus action to retract the line, moving to a space adjacent to the grappling hook. When you are within 10 feet of the grappling hook you can use a reaction to return it to the <em>grappling gun</em>.<br />
A <em>grappling gun</em> that has its line obstructed or broken (AC 20, 20 hit points) becomes inoperable until it is reloaded with an action.<br />
In addition, you can fire the <em>grappling gun</em> as an attack against a creature (range 60/120 ft.), dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage. On a hit the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<h2>Gremlin Translator</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (gear gremlin), uncommon (cost 250 gp)</em><br />

<li>Where is the privy?</li>
</ul>
<p>When prompted the gremlin provides you with the correct translation of any of those phrases in any language. It can also attempt to translate anything spoken or written in any language, but it only recognizes the words that comprise the above phrases.</p>
<h2>Guide to Respecting Social Mores</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 450 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Vials of essence from a chaotic plane<br />
This book contains instructions on etiquette and proper behavior. Its hidden and most useful purpose is to scream loudly to create a distraction whenever its carrier is subjected to unwanted social interactions.</p>
<h2>Hammer of Thunderbolts</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (maul), legendary (requires attunement; cost 60,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Anvil of a storm giant, forge lit by the breath of a dragon<br />
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic maul. This weapon can only be attuned to when you are wearing a <em>belt of giant strength</em> and <em>gauntlets of ogre power</em>. The attunement ends if you remove or change attunement away from either of those items.<br />
While attuned to and holding this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Strength score increases by 4 (and can exceed 20, but not 30).  </li>
<li>When you attack a giant with this weapon and roll a natural 20, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.  </li>
<li>The maul has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each dawn. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the maul with a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet. On a hit, the maul unleashes a thunderclap heard from up to 300 feet away. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Handy Haversack</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 1,250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Silk from a drider<br />
This backpack has three compartments, each of which is an extradimensional space. Two small compartments can each hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central compartment can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds regardless of its contents.<br />
You can place an object in the haversack as normal, following the rules for interacting with objects. You can retrieve any item from the haversack as an action: the desired item is always magically on top. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents are ejected safely, and the haversack must be reversed before its magic properties function.<br />
Food or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities—after being in the bag, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored to life by <em>revivify</em>, <em>raise dead</em>, or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.<br />
The bag cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky quality.<br />
If the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged, it is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane.<br />
Placing a <em>handy haversack</em> inside another extradimensional storage device such as a <em>bag of holding</em> or <em>portable hole</em> results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.</p>
<h2>Hat of Disguise</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Mimic blood<br />
While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast <em>disguise self</em> at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.</p>
<h2>Hat of Grand Entrances</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; cost 35 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Signet ring, seal or other object bearing a family crest<br />
This top hat has embroidered figurines of trumpet players in full regalia. By speaking a command word, you can cause the figures to magically and loudly herald your arrival by trumpet blasts, followed by a speech announcing your name, titles, and any of your major accomplishments. You can alter this speech beforehand by giving any special instructions to the hat before speaking the command word. Once this hat has heralded an entrance it can’t be used again for 10 minutes.</p>
<h2>Headband of Intellect</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Intellect devourer brain<br />
Wearing this headband increases your Intelligence score to 19. It has no effect if your Intelligence is equal to greater than 19.</p>
<h2>Helm of Brilliance</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 50,000 gp with half charges, 100,000 with full charges)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Celestial’s eye or a <em>scroll of sunbeam</em>, and the needed gems (10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals)<br />
This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Gems removed from the helm crumble to dust. The helm loses its magic when all the gems are removed.<br />
While wearing this helm, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) with the listed gem as its component: <em>daylight</em> (opal), <em>fireball</em> (fire opal), <em>prismatic spray</em> (diamond), or <em>wall of fire</em> (ruby). The gem is then destroyed.  </li>
<li>If at least one diamond remains, the helm casts dim light in a 30-foot radius if at least one undead is within 30 feet. Any undead that starts its turn in the light takes 1d6 radiant damage.  </li>
<li>If at least one ruby remains, you have resistance to fire damage.  </li>
<li>If at least one fire opal remains, you can use an action to speak a command word and cause a weapon you are holding to erupt in flames, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. The flames cast bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word or you release the weapon.  </li>
<li>Whenever you fail a saving throw against a spell and take fire damage as a result, roll a d20. On a 1, light blazes from the remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and the remaining gems are then destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Helm of Comprehending Languages</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scroll with a greeting written in at least 20 languages by native writers, or a page written in Celestial by a native writer<br />
While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast <em>comprehend languages</em> at will.</p>
<h2>Helm of Telepathy</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 1,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fairy dragon scales or an aboleth’s eye<br />
While wearing this helm, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use an action to cast <em>detect thoughts</em> (save DC 13) at will. While maintaining concentration, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply with a bonus action while you are focused on it. If a creature successfully saves against this property, it becomes immune to it for 24 hours.  </li>
<li>Once between long rests, while focusing on a creature with <em>detect thoughts</em> you can use an action to cast <em>suggestion</em> (save DC 13) on that creature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Helm of Teleportation</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 48,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Cup of astral matter<br />
While wearing this helm you can use an action to cast <em>teleport</em>. The helm has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.</p>
<h2>Holy Avenger</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a herald; cost 100,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Holy symbol that has traveled to an Upper Plane<br />
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword. When you use it to hit a fiend or undead, it deals an extra 2d10 radiant damage. In addition, while drawn the sword creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and friendly creatures in the aura gain advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the herald class, the aura increases to a 30-foot radius.</p>
<h2>Hopeful Slippers</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement; cost 10,400 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Shoes of a humanoid worn during at least 1 year of menial labor, and that same humanoid’s recited heartfelt wishes (they must be present to recite wishes for at least 1 hour of the item’s crafting time)<br />
A wish made from the innocent heart of a scullery maid created these magical shoes, upon which she danced her way into a better life. You can only attune to these shoes if you are the first creature to do so. When you attune to the shoes, they resize to perfectly fit your feet and your feet alone. During the day they take the form of simple wooden clogs, and by night the shoes transform into beautiful glass slippers that somehow hold your weight without breaking.<br />
While wearing these shoes as clogs, your Wisdom score increases by 2 and you gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks. While wearing these shoes as glass slippers, your Charisma score increases by 2 and you gain an expertise die on Performance checks.<br />
Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to shatter the glass slipper against the floor, sending shards exploding outward in a 10-foot radius. Creatures and objects in the area make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 magical piercing damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Afterwards the area becomes difficult terrain, and the remaining shoe becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Horn of Blasting</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (4,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Metal that has been struck by a storm giant’s lightning<br />
You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and blow it, emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take double damage.<br />
Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20% chance of making it explode, dealing 10d6 fire damage to you and destroying it.</p>
<h2>Horn of Valhalla</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rarity varies (cost varies)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Varies<br />
You can use an action to blow this horn and summon the spirits of fallen warriors. These spirits appear within 60 feet of you and use the statistics for berserker hordes. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again for 7 days.<br />
Four types of <em>horn of Valhalla</em> are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserker hordes answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The Narrator chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.</p>

<h2>Horseshoes of a Zephyr</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost 17,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Precious gem spun in the winds of an air elemental, a metal weapon that has been wielded by a djinni and subject to its <em>plane shift</em><br />
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to perform the following feats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground, allowing it to cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces (such as lava or water).  </li>
<li>Leave no tracks and ignore difficult terrain.  </li>
<li>Move its Speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering fatigue from a forced march.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Horseshoes of Speed</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 4,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Staff wielded by a druid for a year and a day, steel blessed by a unicorn<br />
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. Once all four are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, its Speed increases by 30 feet.</p>
<h2>How to Make Fiends and Influence People</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (cost 60,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Chains from a chain devil<br />
The cracks in the deep green leather binding of this ancient book reveal an unwavering orange glow. After studying this book for 1 hour each day over the course of a year and a day, you gain permanent influence over one randomly determined humanoid on your plane, even if it is immune to being charmed. This otherwise functions as the <em>suggestion</em> spell (no saving throw). The target uses the statistics of a <strong>cambion</strong>, but maintains its prior physical appearance. A <em>wish</em> spell, or the destruction of the book via <em>disintegrate</em> or similar magic, frees the creature from this effect.</p>
<h2>Humour Realignment Transfiguration</h2>
<p><em>Varies, common (cost 30 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Malachite<br />
People seeking a permanent change to their body tend to avoid shapechanging magic—it’s costly and scarce, and the thought of a wayward dispel reverting you to your old form and triggering a wave of dysphoria is horrifying. Instead most seek out magics that gradually encourage the systems of their body to adopt a new form. These magics take many shapes: potions from an alchemist, a blessed amulet, a pouch of ritual ingredients from a wizard.<br />
Using the magic requires a 5 minute ritual at the end of each long rest. At the end of the first month, your outward appearance begins to take on the shape and characteristics of a form more comfortable to you. By the end of six months of use, your body fully shifts to your desired comfortable form. To maintain the new form you must continue to perform the ritual—ceasing it reverts these changes at the same pace. Any new form must be of the same heritage as your previous form.</p>
<h2>Hungry Quasit</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), common (cost 75 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Quasit horns<br />
This Tiny bloodstone is carved in the shape of a grinning, pot-bellied quasit. Whenever you would gain temporary hit points, you can choose to store them inside the quasit instead. Unlike normal temporary hit points, the hit points you store inside the quasit stack, although the maximum number of temporary hit points the quasit can hold at one time is equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum 1).<br />
You can use an action to activate the quasit and gain all the temporary hit points currently stored inside it, which last for up to 1 hour. Whenever you activate the quasit, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, you don’t gain any temporary hit points, and instead the quasit animates and flies off never to be seen again.</p>
<h2>Ice Riders</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 260 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Yeti feet<br />
The magic focused in the soles of these boots enable you to traverse ice and snow as if it were solid, non-slippery ground. You ignore difficult terrain created by cold conditions.<br />
When traveling over snow, you leave only 1/2-inch deep footprints, enabling you to walk over deep drifts without the dangers of falling in. Similarly, you can step onto a floating chunk of ice without fear of tipping it over, although jumping onto the ice will “push” it in the direction of the jump.</p>
<h2>Immovable Rod</h2>
<p><em>Rod, uncommon (cost 400 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Drop of <em>sovereign glue</em>, 2 lodestones<br />
You can use an action to press this metal rod’s single button, magically fixing it in place where it defies gravity. To move the rod, you or another creature must use an action to press the button again.<br />
The rod can support up to 8,000 pounds of weight (if this is exceeded, the rod deactivates and falls). A creature that attempts to move the rod needs to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the rod up to 10 feet on a success.</p>
<h2>Impossible Cube</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Metal made from ore that has visited at least 7 planes<br />
At a glance this hand-sized item appears to be a metal framework in the simple shape of a cube, but when looked at more closely it becomes clear that the geometry of the framework is impossible with absurd angles, preposterous twists, and endpoints. Any attempt to follow the various lines and compositions to their conclusion is frustrating at best and truly maddening at worst.<br />
When a creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher sees the cube for the first time it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become compelled to study the cube further. When a creature first studies the cube, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffers from the Terrorized short-term mental stress effect and a compulsion to study the cube even further. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more instead suffers from the Distorted Perceptions long-term mental stress effect. Any further inspection of the cube has no additional effect.</p>
<h2>Infernal Carapace</h2>
<p><em>Armor (full plate), very rare (requires attunement; cost 17,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Profane writ, plate armor<br />
This suit of terrifying full plate is engraved with Infernal runes that blaze with unholy power. You cannot attune to this armor if you have the Good alignment trait. While attuned to and wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your AC increases by 2.  </li>
<li>You count as one size category larger when determining your carrying capacity.  </li>
<li>Your Strength score increases to 20. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.  </li>
<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.  </li>
<li>Once between rests, as a bonus action you can choose a creature that can see you, forcing it to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1 minute.  </li>
<li>Your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.  </li>
<li>Celestials, elementals, fey, and creatures with the Good alignment trait have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inkpot of the Thrifty Apprentice</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 75 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> First and last pay stubs received by an apprentice clerk<br />
This appears like a mundane pot of ink. When you speak the command word and use a bonus action to expend 1 charge, it fills with enough ink of the color of your choice to fill 50 pages of parchment. This ink is extremely hard to remove from any surface, including cloth or flesh, and often takes many days and washings to clean away. The ink cannot be used to inscribe spells. When removed from the pot with anything but a quill the ink instantly dries.<br />
When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges as an action, a 15-foot cone of ink erupts from the inkpot, coating anything and everything that it hits. Creatures in the area make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature is blinded until it spends an action cleaning the ink away from its eyes.<br />
The inkpot has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 5 or less, the inkpot loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Inspiring Pahu</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 140 gp)</em><br />
Crafting Components: Weapon entombed for at least 100 years with a humanoid warrior<br />
This large bass drum is covered in cured sharkskin. When struck the drum creates a deep resonant sound that sets the tempo for a song, an excellent tool for motivating warriors before battle.<br />
This drum has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can use a bonus action to play it and expend 1 charge, focusing its energies on a living creature that has 0 hit points and that you can see within 20 feet. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has advantage on death saving throws.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to play it and expend 2 charges. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a success, a creature gains inspiration.<br />
If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the sharkskin membrane covering the drum breaks and it becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Instant Fortress</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (15,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> 1,000 pounds of stone from a fortress that has withstood siege, bulette hides<br />
As an action, you can place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high. Each creature or unattended object in the area where the fortress appears takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage. Creatures can make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a success.<br />
Once activated, the fortress remains until you use another action to speak the command word that dismisses it. The fortress can only be dismissed when it is empty.<br />
When activated, the cube transforms into a square tower, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement along the top, with a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action (it is immune to spells like <em>knock</em> and related magic, such as a <em>chime of opening</em>.) The tower’s interior has two floors, with a ladder connecting them and continuing on to a trapdoor to the roof.<br />
The tower is made of adamantine, and it can’t be tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20, 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons that aren’t siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a <em>wish</em> spell can repair the fortress: each casting causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points. This use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th-level or lower.</p>
<h2>Instrument of Irresistible Symphonies</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Gilded songbird feathers<br />
Once per week, you can use an action to speak a command word that causes this instrument to play its own beautiful music for 1 minute. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of the instrument that is able to hear the music. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw at the start of each of its turns or it is forced to dance in place for as long as the music plays. While the creature dances, it is considered grappled.</p>
<h2>Ioun Stones</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous items, rarity varies (requires attunement; cost varies)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Varies—see individual stones<br />
There are many types of <em>ioun stones</em>, each imbued with powerful beneficial magic. Once you have attuned to one, you can use an action to set it in a gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature may use an action to try and take an orbiting stone, but must make a melee attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. An <em>ioun stone</em>’s AC is 24, it has 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive state. Each stone has an effect while it is orbiting your head.</p>

<h2>Iron Bands of Binding</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 1,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Glabrezu pincer, link from a chain devil’s chain<br />
This smooth iron sphere conceals a formidable set of restraints that unfolds into metal bands when thrown. Once between long rests you can use an action to throw it at a creature within 60 feet, treating it as if it were a ranged weapon attack with which you are proficient. On a hit, if the creature is Huge-sized or smaller it becomes restrained until you use a bonus action to speak a different command word and release it.<br />
A creature can try to break the bands by using an action to make a DC 20 Strength Check. On a success, the bands are broken and the restrained creature is freed. On a failure, the creature cannot try again until 24 hours have passed.</p>
<h2>Iron Flask</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (cost 50,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Cold iron refined on the night of a new moon<br />
This dark iron bottle feels heavy in your hand. Engraved with powerful runes of binding, it is capable of trapping otherworldly creatures. You can use an action to speak the command word and remove the silver stopper from the flask, targeting a creature within 60 feet that is not native to the plane of existence the flask is currently on.<br />
If the <em>iron flask</em> is empty and you can see the creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become trapped in the flask. A creature that has previously been trapped in this flask has advantage on this save. The trapped creature is held in stasis—it doesn’t breathe, eat, drink, or age.<br />
As an action, you can release the creature trapped within. A released creature remains friendly to you and your allies for 1 hour, during which it obeys your verbal commands, and afterward it acts normally. Without any commands or when given a command likely to result in its death, the creature defends itself but otherwise takes no actions.<br />
Casting <em>identify</em> on this flask also reveals if a creature is trapped within, but will not reveal the type. The only way to determine an <em>iron flask</em>’s contents is to open the flask and release its inhabitant.<br />
Newly acquired <em>iron flasks</em> may already have a trapped creature, either chosen by the Narrator or determined randomly.</p>

<h2>Ironweed Rope</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 200 gp per 50 feet)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Vines from a shambling mound<br />
When this tough, fibrous plant is carefully woven into rope it has AC 17, 10 hit points, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.</p>
<h2>Ivory Knights</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp each)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Knights from a chess set used by best friends to play at least a dozen games of chess<br />
These two ivory figurines look as though they belong with a chess set. If you and one other person hold one of the knights, you can use an action to whisper in the ear of the game piece to communicate with the creature holding the other (as the <em>message</em> cantrip).<br />
If you and the person carrying the other figurine hold your game pieces to your hearts while within 120 feet of each other, you share a remembrance of two outmatched knights rushing into battle. Within the next minute, each of you can use an action once to teleport to any point between your current positions. You each can teleport once, after which the figurines lose their power.</p>
<h2>Jade Tiger</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Blood of a weretiger<br />
This jade figurine carries the memories of a weretiger that spent years tracking and hunting its prey under the light of the jungle moon. When you attune to the item and keep it on your person, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made to find and follow tracks for up to 1 hour per day.<br />
When you speak the <em>jade tiger</em>’s command word, you vividly recall one of the weretiger’s most challenging hunts. For the next minute, you can use a bonus action to make a Stealth check to hide immediately before or after you take the Attack action. The <em>jade tiger</em>’s magic forever fades away after being used in this way.</p>
<h2>Jarred Brain</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 75 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Brain of a humanoid academic<br />
A humanoid brain floats in formaldehyde within this glass and iron jar, the electrodes protruding from its lid sparking on occasion as the mass of tissue within twitches. You can use an action to gain a flash of insight by shocking your own mind with the jar’s electrodes, taking 1d6 lightning damage. You gain 5 expertise dice to use on Intelligence checks made in the next minute, either individually or up to as many as 3 at a time. Once the jar is used in this way the sparks recede and it cannot be used in this way again for the next 24 hours.<br />
Alternatively, the brain can be wired up directly to the mind of another creature. This process takes 1 minute and allows a creature to consult the jarred brain about a specific course of action (as the spell <em>augury</em>), after which it malfunctions and shatters.</p>
<h2>Javelin of Lightning</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (javelin), uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Amber found on a stormy day at the beach<br />
Once per dawn, when you throw this magic weapon and speak its command word it transforms into a 5-foot wide line of electricity that is 120 feet long. Each creature in the area (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success. The target of your attack takes the javelin’s normal damage plus 4d6 lightning damage.</p>
<h2>Lantern of Revealing</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 3,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pixie dust, glass that’s been to the Astral Plane<br />
While lit, this hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius, revealing invisible creatures and objects in that area, and dim light an additional 30 feet. If you use an action to lower the hood it casts light only in a 5-foot radius. The lantern stays lit for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil.</p>
<h2>Legerdemain Gloves</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Gloves worn by a stage magician for at least one performance<br />
While wearing both of these gloves, once per minute you can teleport an item, up to the size of a dagger, from one hand to the other.<br />
The gloves can teleport an item a longer distance, but their magic is forever exhausted in the process. When you wear one glove and another creature within 120 feet wears the other, you can teleport an item up to the size of a dagger into the hand of the creature wearing the other glove. If you do, the gloves dry and crack, losing their magic and becoming mundane items.</p>
<h2>Library Scarf</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scarf knitted and gifted by a loved one<br />
A library scarf appears as a simple woolen scarf of whatever color or pattern its creator chooses. When you use a bonus action to speak its command word and expend 1 charge, the scarf magically warms you for 2 hours, providing comfort and protection from cold temperatures down to freezing (under more frigid conditions, each charge insulates you for 1 hour.)<br />
In dire circumstances, the scarf can offer more significant protection. When you take cold damage, you can use your reaction and expend 3 charges to gain cold resistance until the end of the round.<br />
The scarf has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the scarf loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p>
<h2>Liquid Luck</h2>
<p><em>Potion, legendary (cost 55,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Crushed moonstone, last breath of an adventurer who died of old age<br />
This ornate vial contains a liquid that shimmers with opalescent hues. After drinking this potion, for the next 24 hours you have advantage whenever you roll a d20.</p>
<h2>Listening Quills</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Gilded raven quill meticulously used to record at least 20 hours of academic recitation<br />
When you spend a bonus action to speak the command word and expend 1 charge, this quill leaps to life and copies everything said by a target that you can hear within 60 feet. The quill ceases to copy after 1 hour, when the target moves more than 60 feet away from it, stops speaking for more than 10 minutes, or when it runs out of writing surface.<br />
When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges, as an action you hurl it at a target you can see within 10 feet. For 1 minute, the quill attacks once per round at the end of your turn. It has a +2 bonus to attack and deals 1d4 piercing damage on a successful hit. When you roll a natural 1 to attack with the quill, it loses its magic and becomes a mundane item. Otherwise, it falls to the ground when its target has moved more than 15 feet away or become incapacitated.<br />
The quill has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.</p>
<h2>Lockpicks of Memory</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Thieves’ tools used in at least one burglary<br />
These lockpicks twitch in your hands when they come within 5 feet of a lock they have been used to open within the last year. You can use these lockpicks and an action to unlock any lock that the lockpicks have previously opened.<br />
Alternatively, you can exhaust the lockpicks’ magic completely to borrow a skill or memory from a previous user. You can choose to either watch 10 minutes of a previous user’s memory (taken from the span of time they had the lockpicks in their possession) or for 10 minutes you can gain one skill, tool, or language proficiency of the previous user. At the end of the duration, the lockpicks rust away to nothing.</p>
<h2>Long Fang of the Moon</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement; cost 55,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Stone from the moon<br />
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this silvered longsword.<br />
Weapon attacks deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage against creatures. When you hit a shapeshifter with this weapon, it makes a DC 30 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it reverts to its original form and you may choose to prevent the shapeshifter from transforming for up to 10 minutes.</p>
<h2>Luck Blade</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement; cost 150,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Favor paid by a genie<br />
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword. While you are holding it, you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. In addition, it has the following properties:<br />
<strong>Luck.</strong> Once per dawn, while the sword is on your person you may reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You must use the new roll.<br />
<strong>Wish.</strong> Once per dawn, while holding the weapon you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast <em>wish</em>. The weapon has 1d4 – 1 charges and loses this property when there are no charges left.</p>
<h2>Lucky Halfling Foot</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 115 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Foot of a halfling that died of old age<br />
This hairy humanoid foot has been chemically preserved and attached to a simple chain necklace as a pendant. Whenever you roll a natural 1 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw while wearing this necklace, you may choose to reroll and must use the new result. Once you make a reroll in this way, you cannot do so again for 24 hours. In addition, halflings get an unnerving sense of this macabre trophy even when it is hidden. While wearing this necklace you have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks to influence halflings.<br />
Alternatively, these mortal remains can be buried or burned properly through halfling funerary rites taking 1 hour. Up to 8 creatures in attendance gain inspiration.</p>
<h2>Luminescent Gum</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 200 gp per gum)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Sponges harvested from the abyssal plains at the bottom of the ocean<br />
This salty chewing gum is made from the sap of a deep sea plant and is normally stored inside of a clamshell. In order to activate it, you must chew the gum as an action. The center of your forehead forms a slight bump and begins to glow. Any darkness within a range of 120 feet becomes dim light, and any dim light within the same range becomes bright light. The effect lasts for 1 hour, after which the gum loses its magical properties. The gum itself is a bit of an acquired taste and when you chew it for the first time you must make a DC 10 Constitution check or gain the stunned condition for a round as you vomit. Vomited gum can be retrieved and used again, but its remaining duration is halved every time it is reused.<br />
Luminescent gum is generally found in bunches of 6 or 12 clamshells.</p>
<h2>Mace of Disruption</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Mace of a deva<br />
When you hit a fiend or undead with a melee attack using this weapon, you deal the target an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If this damage reduces a fiend or undead to 25 hit points or fewer, the target makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is destroyed. On a success, the target becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.<br />
While it is held, this weapon shines bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light an additional 20 feet.</p>
<h2>Mace of Smiting</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (mace), rare (cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Treant branch<br />
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus increases to +3 if you use the weapon to attack a construct.<br />
When you use this weapon to make an attack and roll a natural 20, you deal the target an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 4d6 bludgeoning damage if the target is a construct. If this damage reduces a construct to 25 hit points or fewer, the target is destroyed.</p>
<h2>Mace of Terror</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Shard of a broken mirror that once reflected a banshee’s horrifying visage<br />
This weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges at dawn. While you hold the weapon, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to emanate terror in a 30-foot radius. Each creature you choose within the area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While frightened, the target can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. On each of its turns, the target must move away from you as fast as possible (it can only use the Dash action, try to escape anything preventing it from moving, or use the Dodge action if it can’t move or attempt escape). The target can’t take reactions. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<h2>Madam Yolanda’s Prison</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Large ruby<br />
This red ruby contains the spirit of an elven archmage named Madam Yolanda. Identifying the ruby causes Madam Yolanda to appear. Madame Yolanda uses the statistics of an archmage fluent in Common and Elvish. The Narrator randomly determines her attitude towards the creature who finds her by rolling on the Madam Yolanda’s Prison table.</p>

<h2>Magic Mirror</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 300 gp), rare (requires attunement; cost 3,000 gp), or very rare (cost 10,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Bones of a long-dead seer, ground to dust (uncommon), silver from a sphinx’s lair (rare), refined glass from the Astral Plane (very rare)<br />
Magic mirrors are found in three sizes.<br />
<strong><em>Pocket (Uncommon).</em></strong> You can use the mirror as a spellcasting focus. As an action, you can look into the mirror and cast <em>augury</em>. When you do, your reflection whispers the answers to your questions. Once you’ve used this property twice, it can’t be used again until the next dawn, at which time it regains all expended uses.<br />
<strong><em>Handheld (Rare)</em></strong>. You can use the mirror as a spellcasting focus. As an action, you can look into the mirror and cast <em>augury</em> or <em>divination</em>. When you do, your reflection whispers the answers to your questions. Once you’ve used the mirror to cast <em>augury</em> or <em>divination</em>, the mirror can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.<br />
<strong><em>Wall (Very Rare).</em></strong> While this bulky mirror is securely fastened to a wall, you can use an action to look into the mirror and cast <em>commune</em>, <em>contact other plane,</em> or <em>divination</em>. When you do so, your reflection answers your questions. Once you’ve used this property twice, it can’t be used again until the next dawn, at which time it regains all expended uses.<br />
Additionally, you can use an action to link the wall mirror to another <em>magic mirror</em> by speaking the name of the other mirror’s owner. When you do, you initiate a face-to-face conversation that can last up to 10 minutes. Both you and the other mirror’s owner can clearly see each other’s faces, but neither one of you gets any sense of the other’s surroundings. Either you or the other mirror’s owner can use a bonus action to end the conversation early. Once you’ve used this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Exquisite leather-bound tome, giant squid ink<br />
This tome is packed with arcane schematics and mystic instructions for creating a specific kind of guardian either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined.<br />

<h2>Manual of Quickness of Action</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost 20,000 gp)</em><br />

This magical book details workout routines for building coordination and speed.

<h2>Marble of Direction</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Marble lost by a child<br />
When you place this marble on a flat, horizontal surface such as the floor of a room, the marble rolls in the direction of the air currents around it.<br />
Asan action, you can speak the marble’s command word while placing the marble on a flat, horizontal surface. The marble then rolls towards the nearest exit of the room it’s placed in (regardless of air currents), ultimately coming to rest against the exit. The marble then becomes a mundane object.</p>
<h2>Marvelous Pigments</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (cost 8,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Fire beetle shell, slime from 10 different snails<br />
These iridescent paints and accompanying brush can be used to create inanimate objects, terrain features, doors, and even rooms. When you touch the brush to a surface and concentrate on the image of the object you want to create, the paint flows from the brush, creating a painting. Once complete, the painting becomes a real, three-dimensional object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small, simple objects take a single round to paint. Larger objects, like doors or rooms, take more time. It takes 1 minute of concentration to cover 10 square feet of a surface, and 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet of a surface.  </li>
<li>Objects created by the pigment are real and nonmagical—a door painted on a wall can be opened into whatever lies beyond. A pit becomes a real pit (be sure to include the depth in your total area). A tree blooms and grows.  </li>
<li>Objects created by the pigments are worth a maximum of 25 gp. Gemstones or fine clothing might look authentic, but close inspection reveals they are facsimiles made from cheaper materials.  </li>
<li>When found the box contains 1d4 pots of pigment.  </li>
<li>A pot of pigment can cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, creating a total area of 10,000 cubic feet of objects.  </li>
<li>Energy created by the paints, such as a burst of radiant light or a wildfire, dissipates harmlessly and doesn’t deal any damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maternal Cameo</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 90 gp)</em><br />

While wearing this cameo, you gain an expertise die on saving throws against fear.<br />
Once you’ve worn the cameo for 24 hours, the face carved in relief on the cameo magically transforms to resemble the face of your biological mother. When the cameo is destroyed, the spirit of the person carved in the cameo is summoned, provided that person is dead (if the person is still alive, destroying the cameo has no effect.) The spirit remains for up to 10 minutes. During that time, the spirit can speak but is otherwise unable to affect the Material Plane.</p>

The spell is cast only if a creature is holding the paired stone or if the stone is otherwise touching the creature’s skin.<br />
Once you’ve used one of the stones, the stones can’t be used again until the next dawn. If one of the paired stones is destroyed, the other loses its magical properties.</p>
<h2>Message Whistle</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Gilded feather of an elderly messenger hawk<br />
Blowing through this whistle doesn’t produce an audible sound. As an action, you can blow lightly through the whistle to cast the <em>message</em> cantrip without any other spell components. Once you’ve used the whistle, it can’t be used again for 7 days.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to blow extremely hard through the whistle to cast <em>sending</em> without any other spell components. When you cast <em>sending</em> in this way, your message can contain only 10 words, and there’s a 10 percent chance the message doesn’t arrive (even if you’re on the same plane of existence as the recipient). The whistle is then destroyed in a burst of sparkles.</p>
<h2>Meteorological Map</h2>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Air from the Plane of Air, beautiful leather-bound tome, ember from the Plane of Fire<br />
This book has a simple, line-drawn map of the world on its cover. Writing the name of a specific place (no larger than a small town) on one of its blank pages causes the book to magically write out a 50-word description of the current weather conditions there. The description completely fills that page of the book.<br />
The book contains 25 blank pages. Pages can’t be erased or otherwise divorced from their target location once the location’s name has been written.</p>
<h2>Midnight Pearls</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 95 gp each)</em><br />

These earrings always appear wet and tinge the air nearby with the slightest taste of saltwater. You don’t need pierced ears to wear the earrings; when placed against your ear lobes, they naturally stick to your skin.<br />
You can use an action to smash one of the earrings to create, a cloud of magical darkness in a 5-foot radius. For the next 1d4 rounds, the radius of the cloud increases by 10 feet each round. The cloud then disappears.</p>
<h2>Mindrazor</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement; cost 100,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Vitrified brain<br />
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.<br />

When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll made with the weapon, the target also becomes confused for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw, ending the effect on a success.<br />
You can use an action to work <em>Mindrazor</em> upon the memories of a restrained or incapacitated creature within 5 feet (as a <em>modify memory</em> spell cast at 9th level). Once you’ve used this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

This 50-pound mirror hides an extradimensional prison beneath its smooth, silvery surface.<br />
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to activate or deactivate the mirror by speaking its command word. While the mirror is active, when a creature other than you sees its reflection in the mirror while within 30 feet of it, that creature makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. Creatures that are aware of the mirror’s magical nature have advantage on the save, and constructs automatically succeed. On a failed save, the creature and all its possessions are trapped inside one of the mirror’s 12 extradimensional cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each extradimensional cell is an infinite plane filled with thick fog. Creatures trapped in a cell don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep, nor do they age.  </li>
<li>Creatures can escape a cell via planar travel, but otherwise they remain trapped until they are freed.  </li>
<li>If a creature would become trapped but the mirror’s cells are already full, a randomly determined trapped creature is freed to make room for the new prisoner.  </li>
<li>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to call forth a trapped creature. The creature appears on the mirror’s surface, allowing you and the creature to communicate normally.  </li>
<li>A trapped creature can be freed by using an action to speak a different command word. The creature appears in an unoccupied space near the mirror and facing away from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mirror has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the mirror shatters, freeing all trapped creatures. The creatures appear in unoccupied spaces nearby.</p>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Hair cut from a dead humanoid while they were living<br />
This medallion hangs from a rope of braided hair.

When you use this property, roll a d20. On a 6 or higher, the medallion can’t be used this way again until the next dawn. On a 5 or less, the medallion becomes a mundane piece of jewelry.<br />
Alternatively, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to rip the medallion from its braid. If you do, you drop to 1 hit point instead, and the medallion becomes a mundane piece of jewelry.</p>

<h2>Orb of the Dragon Breaker</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 3,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Dragon scale<br />
When used as an improvised weapon, the orb shatters upon impact. If the orb shatters against a creature, that creature’s immunity or resistance to a damage type associated with the dragon scale used in the orb’s creation (fire for a red dragon scale, acid for a green dragon scale, and so on) is either reduced from immunity to a damage type to resistance to the same damage type, or the creature loses its resistance. The orb’s effects last for 1d6 + 1 rounds, after which time the creature’s defenses return to normal.</p>
<h2>Organizer Gremlin</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (gear gremlin), common (requires attunement; cost 90 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pen owned by a failed scribe<br />
This pocketbook comes with a tiny, ethereal gremlin that holds a cheap pen and eagerly awaits your instructions. Roughly half of the 120-page book is blank scratch paper, and the other half is a calendar of the current year. The gremlin writes down anything you ask it to and even takes down dictation if requested. It also marks reminders in the calendar and circles dates. Despite its love for writing, its penmanship is quite poor, it doesn’t understand anything it writes, and it always misspells any word with three or more syllables. Accurately understanding anything the gremlin writes requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence check.</p>

<p><em>Armor (chain shirt), rare (requires attunement; cost 3,750 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Corpse of a humanoid blacksmith<br />

<h2>Paramour’s Daisy</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (requires attunement; cost 130 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Love letter written in earnest but never delivered<br />
This bright yellow daisy never wilts or fades. The daisy has exactly 20 petals when you first receive it.<br />
While the daisy has an even number of petals, you gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks, but you have disadvantage on Stealth checks.<br />
While the daisy has an odd number of petals, you gain an expertise die on Stealth checks, but you have disadvantage on Persuasion checks.<br />

<h2>Pearl of Power</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 300 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Aboleth slime<br />
While holding this pearl, you can use an action to speak its command word to regain one expended spell slot of up to 3rd level. If you attempt to regain a higher-level slot, the new slot is 3rd level. Once used, the pearl loses its magic until the next dawn.</p>
<h2>Perdita Ravenwing’s True Name</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; cost 90 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Parchment cured at The Bleak Gate<br />
You can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this slip of parchment to summon a vision of an ancient hag beside you for 1 minute. Once you’ve summoned the vision, it can’t be summoned again for the next 24 hours.<br />
You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create ominous noises or effects (as the <em>thaumaturgy</em> cantrip)  </li>
<li>Magically poison up to a pound of food within 5 feet. A creature that consumes the poisoned food must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 10 minutes.  </li>
<li>Mimic animal sounds or the voices of specific humanoids. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 13 Insight check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can use an action to revoke your claim on the hag in exchange for her direct assistance. When you do, the vision curses a creature of your choice within 30 feet (as the <em>bestow curse</em> spell, save DC 13). The curse lasts for 1 minute, after which the vision disappears and the parchment crumbles to dust.</p>
<h2>Perfect Disguise</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 125 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Glasses worn during at least one paid comedic performance<br />
These glasses have 3 charges and regain 1 expended charge at dawn. While wearing the glasses, you can expend 1 charge to cast <em>disguise self</em> (save DC 14). When you cast the spell in this way, you can’t mask the glasses themselves—no matter how your disguise looks, it includes the glasses.<br />
If you expend the <em>disguise’s</em> last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the glasses are glued to your face (as with <em>sovereign glue</em>) and become a mundane object.</p>
<h2>Perfume Vile</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 120 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Flowers plucked from the Dreaming<br />
You can use a bonus action to spray perfume from this bottle, immediately dispelling any foul odors on a Large or smaller creature or object and leaving behind only the faint smell of peonies for 1d4 hours. The bottle contains enough perfume for 20 uses.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to throw the bottle, creating a 20-foot-radius sphere of pink gas centered on a point within 30 feet. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for 1d4 rounds. A creature that enters the area or starts its turn there makes a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to the number of sprays remaining). Creatures already wearing the perfume have advantage on the save. On a failure, the creature takes 1d4 poison damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>
<h2>Periapt of Health</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 350 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unicorn mane<br />
While wearing this pendant, you can’t contract any disease, and the effects of any ongoing diseases are suppressed.</p>
<h2>Periapt of Proof Against Poison</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 800 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scales from 10 different venomous snakes<br />
While wearing this pendant, you are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>
<h2>Periapt of Wound Closure</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 400 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Silver blessed by a herald, a troll’s toe<br />
While you wear this pendant, you automatically stabilize if you are dying at the start of your turn. (You can still roll your death saving throw to try to roll a 20, but you can only roll once on each of your turns, and you can’t roll more than three times.) In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you regain twice as many hit points as normal.</p>
<h2>Philter of Love</h2>
<p><em>Potion, uncommon (cost 250 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Petal plucked from a flower in the Dreaming<br />
After drinking this philter, the next time you see a creature in the next 10 minutes, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If you would normally be attracted to the creature, while charmed you believe it to be your true love.</p>
<h2>Pipes of Haunting</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Hollowed bones of a deposed or exiled ruler<br />
These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges at dawn. If you are proficient with wind instruments, you can use an action to play the pipes and expend 1 charge to play a song. Each creature within 30 feet that can hear you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you choose, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the save. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to these <em>pipes of haunting</em> for 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Pipes of the Sewers</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 350 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Hollowed out bones of a giant rat<br />
These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges at dawn. If you are proficient with wind instruments, you can use an action to play the pipes and expend 1 to 3 charges, summoning a <strong>swarm of rats</strong> for each charge you spend. The swarms aren’t under anyone’s control and appear by the shortest available route. If at the Narrator’s discretion there aren’t enough rats within a half mile for this property to take effect, the expended charges are wasted and no swarm is summoned.<br />
While you are using an action to play the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the Wisdom check of a swarm of rats within 30 feet. If you lose the contest, the swarm acts normally and is immune to the pipes for 24 hours. If you win, the swarm becomes friendly to you and your allies and follows your commands until you stop playing the pipes. If not given a command, a friendly swarm defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. A friendly swarm that starts its turn unable to hear music from the pipes breaks your control, behaving as normal and becoming immune to the effects of the pipes for 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Plague Doctor’s Mask</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Wax harvested from bees that have fed on the nectar of flowers from Hell<br />
While wearing this mask, you gain an expertise die on Constitution saving throws against disease.<br />
As an action, you can inhale the fragrance inside the mask, accessing the memories of the doctor who created the mask. Until you finish a long rest, you have advantage on Medicine checks made to treat one nonmagical disease of your choice. The mask then becomes a mundane object.</p>
<h2>Plate Armor of Etherealness</h2>
<p><em>Armor (full plate), legendary (requires attunement; cost 55,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Efreeti breath bottled in a silver-lined vessel<br />
While wearing this armor, you can use an action to cast <em>etherealness</em>. The spell lasts for 10 minutes, until the armor is removed, or until you use an action to end the spell. Once you’ve used this property, it can’t be used again for 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Poisoner’s Almanac</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 2,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Roots gathered from the Dreaming<br />
When found, only 2d6 pages remain inside this tome. Over the course of 1 minute, you can tear out a page from the book and dissolve it in a nonmagical liquid, transforming the liquid into a dose of oil of taggit. Alternatively, you can dissolve the page in a potion or similar magical liquid. If you do, the potion becomes inert.</p>
<h2>Portable Hole</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Preserved corpses of 7 shadows<br />
While not in use, this item appears as a piece of cloth the color of darkness. When unfolded, it opens up into a circular sheet that is 6 feet in diameter.<br />
You can use an action to unfold the <em>portable hole</em> on a stable, solid surface. When unfolded, the item opens into a cylindrical extradimensional space that is 10 feet deep. Closing the hole requires an action and involves you taking hold of the cloth’s edges and folding it up. No matter its contents, the hole weighs next to nothing.<br />
The hole can’t be used to create passages through solid surfaces. Food or water placed in a closed <em>portable hole</em> immediately and permanently loses all nourishing qualities— water no longer slakes thirst and food doesn’t sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the <em>portable hole</em> can’t be restored to life by <em>revivify, raise dead,</em> or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside a closed <em>portable hole</em> can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures inside the hole (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.<br />
While the hole is open, creatures inside can exit the hole by simply climbing out. A creature still within the hole can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to escape as it’s being closed. On a success, the creature appears within 5 feet of the item or creature carrying it.<br />
Placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside another extradimensional storage device, such as a <em>bag of holding</em> or <em>handy haversack</em>, results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.</p>
<h2>Portraiture Gremlin</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (gear gremlin), uncommon (cost 200 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Horsehair brush that has been worn out through regular use<br />
This Tiny, ethereal gremlin sits inside an iron box and is surrounded by dabs of pigments. The box has a switch that when pressed strikes the gremlin on the head with a tiny hammer. When the gremlin is hit by the hammer, it rapidly paints whatever it sees through the small porthole at the front of the box. The gremlin takes 1 minute to finish the picture. The result is a perfectly accurate, albeit miniature, painting of whatever the gremlin saw. The gremlin comes with enough pigments for 5 paintings, but it can be resupplied with paints worth at least 12 gp per subsequent painting.</p>

While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can use an action to cast <em>dancing lights</em> or <em>light</em>. The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges at dawn. You can expend charges from the ring to activate the following properties:<br />

When found, the ring contains 1d6 – 1 levels of stored spells, as determined by the Narrator. The ring can store up to 5 levels’ worth of spells at a time. To store a spell, a creature casts any spell of 1st to 5th level while touching the ring. The spell has no immediate effect. The level at which the spell is cast determines how much space it uses.

<h2>Rod of Absorption</h2>
<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement; cost 30,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Wand wielded by an abjuration archmage<br />
While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell as it’s being cast, provided it targets only you and not an area of effect. An absorbed spell has no effect, and its energy is stored within the rod. The spell’s energy equals the spell levels used to cast it. The rod can store up to 50 spell levels’ worth of energy, after which it permanently loses the ability to absorb energy. If the rod doesn’t have the space to store a spell and you try to absorb it, the rod has no effect. A rod that can no longer store energy and no longer has any energy remaining within it loses its magical properties.<br />
After attuning to the rod, you know how much energy it currently contains and how much it has ever absorbed. A spellcaster can expend the energy in the rod and convert it to spell slots—for example, you can expend 3 spell levels of energy from the rod to cast a 3rd-level spell, even if you no longer have the spell slot to cast it. The spell must be a spell you know or have prepared, at a level you can cast, and no higher than 5th-level.<br />
When found, the rod contains 1d10 spell levels. </p>
<h2>Rod of Alertness</h2>
<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement; cost 15,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Sphinx’s eye, wild coffee beans picked under a full moon<br />
While holding this rod, you have advantage on Perception checks and initiative rolls, and as an action you can cast the following spells: <em>detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, see invisibility</em>.<br />
<strong><em>Protective Aura.</em></strong> As an action, you can plant the rod in the ground and speak its command word, causing the rod to emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in the bright light, you and creatures friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature also in the bright light.<br />
The rod stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or sooner if a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. Once you’ve used this property, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<h2>Rod of Lordly Might</h2>
<p><em>Rod, legendary (requires attunement; cost 80,000 gp)</em><br />

<li><strong>Paralyze:</strong> The target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success.  </li>
<li><strong>Terrify:</strong> The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve used one of these properties, that property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br />
<strong><em>Six Buttons.</em></strong> The rod has buttons along its haft that alter the rod’s form when pressed. You can press one of the buttons as a bonus action, and the effect lasts until you push a different button for a new effect or press the same button again to revert the rod to its default form.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Button 1:</strong> The rod loses its bonus to attack and damage rolls, instead producing a fiery blade from its haft, which you can wield as a <em>flame tongue</em> sword of your choice.  </li>
<li><strong>Button 2:</strong> The rod transforms into a magic battleaxe.  </li>
<li><strong>Button 3:</strong> The rod transforms into a magic spear.  </li>
<li><strong>Button 4:</strong> The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long. A spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole into any surface as hard as granite. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Either excess weight or a lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its default form.  </li>
<li><strong>Button 5:</strong> The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram that grants a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.  </li>
<li><strong>Button 6:</strong> The rod assumes or remains in its default form and indicates magnetic north, as well as how far above or below ground you are. Nothing happens if this function is used in a location without a magnetic north or a ground as a reference point.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rod of Rulership</h2>
<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Royal scepter given as a prize<br />
While holding this rod, you can use an action to command obedience. Each creature of your choice  within 120 feet that you can see makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you for 8 hours. A creature charmed by you regards you as its trusted leader. The creature ceases to be charmed if you or your companions harm it or if you command it to do something contrary to its nature.</p>
<h2>Rod of Security</h2>
<p><em>Rod, legendary (cost 100,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Vessel abandoned by a genie, bread from a fey’s feast, wine from an angel’s cup<br />
While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it and produce one of the following effects.<br />
<strong><em>Supply Storage.</em></strong> You target up to 20 Supply you can see within 5 feet. The Supply instantly vanishes and is stored inside the rod. The rod can store up to 200 Supply. You can’t use this ability in a paradise (see below).<br />
A newly found rod has 2d100 Supply already stored.<br />
<strong><em>Paradise.</em></strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to activate it and expend an amount of Supply (1 per creature) for yourself and each willing creature you can see. You and the other creatures are instantly transported into an extradimensional haven that takes the form of any paradise you can imagine (or chosen at random using the Sample Paradises table). The paradise contains enough Supply to sustain its visitors for 24 hours. For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains 10 hit points. Creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Each day, you can maintain the extradimensional space for an additional 24 hours by expending an amount of Supply from the rod equal to the number of visitors.<br />
Apart from visitors and the objects they brought into the paradise, everything within the paradise can only exist there. A cushion taken from a palace paradise, for example, disappears when taken outside.<br />
When you expend the last Supply stored in the rod or use an action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or in the nearest unoccupied space, and the rod can’t be used again until 10 days have passed.</p>

This magical rope is 60 feet long, holds up to 3,000 pounds, and weighs only 3 pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can use an action to speak a command word that animates it. As a bonus action, you can make the other end move toward a destination you choose.<br />
The other end moves 10 feet on each of your turns until it reaches the destination, moves its maximum length away, or you command it to halt. You can also command the rope to coil itself, knot itself, unknot itself, or fasten or unfasten itself.<br />
While knotted, the rope shortens to 50 feet as knots appear at 1-foot intervals along its length. Creatures have advantage on checks made to climb the rope while it is knotted.<br />
The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. The rope regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes, as long as it has at least 1 hit point. The rope is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
<h2>Rope of Entanglement</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 3,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Bag of hag hair<br />
You can use an action to speak a command word while holding one end of this rope, causing the other end to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. You can use a bonus action to speak another command word and release any creatures entangled by the rope.<br />
An entangled creature can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice), escaping the rope on a success.<br />
The rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. It has AC 20 and 20 hit points. The rope regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes, as long as it has at least 1 hit point. The rope is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Spite of an angry fey (a fey creature must be present and hostile for at least 1 hour of the item’s crafting time)<br />
While you are concentrating on a spell of 3rd-level or lower, you can use a bonus action to activate the rose. Once activated, the rose maintains concentration on the spell for you for the spell’s duration or until you use another bonus action to end the rose’s concentration.<br />
The rose has 10 petals. When it is activated, a number of petals drop from the rose equal to the level of the spell it is concentrating on. While the spell lasts, at the end of each minute an equal number of petals drop from the rose. When its last petal falls the rose wilts and its magic is lost.<br />
Alternatively, if the rose is thrown against the ground, the magic inside of it implodes and frays magical energies in a 15-foot radius (as the <em>dispel magic</em> spell, gaining a bonus to any spellcasting ability checks equal to the rose’s number of petals).</p>
<h2>Sack of Sacks</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 55 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Sack left to drift on the Astral Plane for at least 7 days<br />

Otherwise, there is another Medium-sized sack inside.</p>
<h2>Satyr Boots</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (cost 110 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Satyr’s horn<br />
While you wear these boots, you gain an expertise die on Performance checks made to dance. As an action, you can transform your legs and feet into the furry haunches and cloven hooves of a goat. The transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you use another action to return to your normal form. While transformed, your Speed becomes 40 feet, you gain an expertise die on Acrobatics checks, and you ignore nonmagical difficult terrain. When the effect ends, the boots fall apart and become useless until a properly trained satyr cobbler repairs them for you.</p>
<h2>Scarab of Protection</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 80,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Gold bar blessed by a celestial associated with a god of life or protection<br />
After being held in your hand for 1 round, this scarab medallion shimmers with magical inscriptions. The scarab has 12 charges, crumbling into dust when it has no charges left.<br />
While the scarab is on your person, you gain advantage on saving throws made against spells. In addition, if you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or an effect originating from an undead creature, you may instead succeed on the saving throw by using your reaction to expend a charge from the scarab.</p>
<h2>Schooled Weapon</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (varies), rare (requires attunement; 2,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Component:</strong> Mithral plate etched with martial philosophy<br />

While you remain attuned to the weapon, you have access to that combat maneuver.<br />
In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with any attack you make with the weapon as part of a combat maneuver from the associated tradition.</p>

<h2>Scimitar of Speed</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement; cost 6,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Feather from a living roc nesting at the peak of a high mountain<br />
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic scimitar, and on each of your turns you can use a bonus action to make one attack with it.</p>
<h2>Scrap of Forbidden Text</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 20 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Diary of a mentally unhinged adventurer<br />
You can use an action to study this scrap of text to gain an expertise die on an Arcana or History check on the next Arcana or History check you make in the next minute. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.<br />
When you make an Arcana or History check, you can use an action to eat the scrap of text. If you do, you automatically succeed on the check. You can wait until after making the check before deciding to eat the <em>scrap of forbidden text</em>, but you must decide before the Narrator says whether the roll succeeds or fails.<br />
<strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Eating the <em>scrap of forbidden text</em> draws the attention of an aberrant creature that seeks you out to involve you in its schemes.</p>
<h2>Seafarer’s Quill</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Gilded feather from a swan in the Dreaming<br />
This elegant swan feather quill allows you to write in perfect cursive, granting you an expertise die on any forgery kit check you make as long as the handwriting you’re copying is also in cursive.<br />
As a bonus action, you can break the quill, magically transforming everything it has written in the last minute to almost perfectly match the original handwriting of whoever you were copying last. Creatures have disadvantage on checks made to realize it is a forgery.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Sea Witch’s Amulet</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 3,150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> An item of sentimental value that belonged to a drowned humanoid<br />
This amulet has 3 charges. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and choose one creature within 30 feet that is laughing, singing, or speaking. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or you steal its voice, transferring it into the amulet. While its voice is in the amulet, the target can’t speak, and you can speak in the target’s voice, provided you are wearing the amulet.You can use a bonus action to release a voice stored in the amulet.<br />
At the end of every 24 hours, the amulet expends 1 charge per voice stored inside it. When the amulet has no more charges to expend, the stolen voices are released and returned to their owners.  If the amulet has no voices stored in it and is soaked in sea water for 24 hours, it regains 1 charge.<br />
Destroying the amulet releases any voices stored inside and creates a brief, piercing shriek in a 100-foot radius. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of its next turn.</p>
<h2>Second-Light Lantern</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 125 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Eyes of a giant bat<br />
This lantern (which can be a hooded lantern or a bullseye lantern) has 4 charges and regains 1 expended charge at dusk. When you light the lantern, you can expend 1 charge to shed second-light. Second-light is visible only to creatures with darkvision, and they see the full range of colors in an area illuminated by second-light.<br />
Alternatively, you can expend 1d4 charges to shed a still more specialized light, visible only to those who are touching the lantern’s handle. This light lasts for a number of minutes equal to the charges expended.<br />
If you expend the lantern’s last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the lantern loses its magic and becomes a mundane object.</p>
<h2>Security Gremlin</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (gear gremlin), common (cost 100 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Armor sized for a Tiny creature<br />
This tin contains a Tiny, ethereal gremlin. While the tin is open, you can instruct the gremlin to patrol an area (such as the perimeter of a room, campsite, or structure) while keeping watch for a creature type of your choice. The gremlin ignores creatures that aren’t of the chosen type. If it spots a creature of the chosen type, it immediately begins shouting loud enough to be heard by all creatures within 30 feet, then returns to the tin.</p>
<h2>Seeds of Necessity</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Handful of mixed seeds grown from a druid’s garden<br />
A pouch of <em>seeds of necessity</em> contains 1d10 coin-sized seeds. When you plant one of these seeds in soil and water it while you picture in your mind an object which you desire, over the course of 1 minute the seed grows into a simple wooden object no larger than a 10-foot-cube that closely matches the picture in your mind (common uses include a ladder, a sturdy table, a throne, a barrel, a cart wheel, or a rowboat). The seed is consumed as it grows into the object.<br />
The seed can’t grow into an object with moving parts, but several seeds could be grown to construct a more complicated shape, such as a cart made from a tray with four wheels, or a rowboat and two oars.<br />
When you plant and water a <em>seed of necessity</em>, roll a d100. On a result of 100, instead of the object you requested, a friendly <strong>awakened shrub</strong> grows in its place. On a result of 13 or less, the seed was a bad seed and instead grows into a hostile <strong>awakened tree</strong>.</p>
<h2>Seven-Sided Coin</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (patron token), uncommon (cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Two-faced coin used to swindle money from at least seven people<br />

<h2>Shield +1, +2, or +3</h2>
<p><em>Armor (shield), rare (cost 1,000 gp) or very rare</em><br />
<em>(cost 7,000 gp or 49,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scale from a young, adult, or ancient dragon<br />
This shield’s bonus to your Armor Class increases by +1 (rare), +2 (very rare), or +3 (very rare).</p>
<h2>Shield of Missile Attraction</h2>
<p><em>Armor, (shield) rare (requires attunement; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scale from a shadow dragon<br />
While wearing this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.<br />
<strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, you become the target instead. Removing the shield does not stop the curse.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Shoulder Dragon Brooch</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement; cost 90 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Pseudodragon’s scale<br />
While you wear this brooch, you can imagine one dragon of your choice, and a Tiny illusion of it appears on your shoulder. The dragon looks lifelike, and it occasionally flies, snaps at insects, and generally behaves in a dragon-like way. This illusion doesn’t hold up to physical scrutiny, and any creature that physically interacts with the dragon sees through the illusion with a successful DC 12 Investigation check. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the illusion.<br />
As a bonus action, you can command the dragon to attack a creature within 5 feet of you. That creature makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) on a failure or half damage on a success. Once you’ve used this property, it can’t be used again for 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Sinner’s Ashes</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 35 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Corpse of a humanoid creature that had the Evil trait<br />
As an action, you can throw this urn up to 30 feet, where it shatters and produces a 20-foot-radius cloud of ash. The area is heavily obscured, and any creature that ends its turn within the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 necrotic damage. The cloud remains for 1 minute or until dispersed. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.<br />
Alternatively, the ashes can be used as an ingestible poison. The urn contains enough ashes for a single dose. A celestial that consumes the ashes makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 necrotic damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</p>
<h2>Slippers of Spider Climbing</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Giant spider silk<br />
While wearing these shoes, you can move on walls and upside down on ceilings without the use of your hands, gaining a climb speed equal to your Speed. The shoes can’t be used on slippery surfaces.</p>
<h2>Skeleton Key</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 145 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Spine of a humanoid that committed at least one major robbery<br />
This key is shaped like a miniature skeleton holding a knife. As an action, you can use the knife to deal yourself 2d4 damage, which can’t be reduced or ignored in any way. If you do, the skeleton animates and walks towards the nearest locked door or object within 10 feet, then plunges itself into the lock and makes a thieves’ tools check with a +10 bonus to pick the lock. Whether the skeleton succeeds or fails, it then walks back to you and returns to its inanimate form.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to cover the skeleton in blood. When you do so, the skeleton walks to the nearest lock within 10 feet and unlocks it (as per the <em>knock</em> spell). The skeleton then dissolves into red mist.</p>
<h2>Skull Liqueur</h2>
<p><em>Potion, uncommon (cost 370 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Broth from zombie bones<br />
Pouring the contents of this phial into the mouth of a dead creature animates the corpse as if it were the target of a <em>speak with dead</em> spell.</p>
<h2>Snake-Eye Bones</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 55 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Skeleton of a venomous snake<br />
No matter how many times this pair of six-sided dice is thrown, the dice never nick or scuff, nor do their markings fade.<br />
The dice have 2 charges and regain 1 charge each dawn. When you speak the command word as a bonus action as the dice are rolled, their results come up as double ones. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 5 or less, the dice roll double ones but both dice then crack in half, rendering both dice useless.</p>
<h2>Sonic Staff</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (quarterstaff), very rare (cost 9,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Tuning fork that has been struck by natural lightning<br />
You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. Attacks made with the staff deal double damage to doors and other objects. The staff constantly emits a high-pitched whine that is uncomfortable to animals. Animals won’t willingly approach within 10 feet of the staff without a successful DC 22 Animal Handling check.<br />
Once per day, you can use an action to slam the staff against the ground and generate a wave of thunder and force in either a 10-foot radius or a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 3d6 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away. This effect can’t penetrate a <em>silence</em> spell or similar effects. </p>
<h2>Sovereign Glue</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (cost 85,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Glass bottle coated with <em>oil of slipperiness</em>, mucus from an amphibian fey<br />
When found, this bottle contains 1d6 + 1 ounces of adhesive inside. You may use one ounce to cover a 1-foot square surface. After 1 minute passes the <em>sovereign glue</em> sets and the bond cannot be broken without using <em>universal solvent</em>, <em>oil of etherealness</em>, or a <em>wish</em> spell.</p>
<h2>Spellguard Shield</h2>
<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement; cost 20,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Iron guardian scrap<br />
While using this metal shield, you have advantage on saving throws made against spells and magical effects, and spell attacks against you have disadvantage.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Spell Scroll</h2>
<p><em>Scroll, varies (cost 10–55,000 gp)</em><br />
Crafting Components: Varies<br />
A <em>spell scroll</em> bears a spell within it. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use the scroll to cast the spell (taking the spell’s normal casting time) without the need for material components. Otherwise, the <em>spell scroll</em> is unreadable to you. If you are interrupted while using the scroll, you can attempt to use it again. Once the spell within a scroll has been cast, the scroll crumbles away.<br />
To use a <em>spell scroll</em> of a higher spell level than you can normally cast, you must succeed on spellcasting ability check (DC 10 + the spell’s level). On a failure, the magical energy within the scroll is expended with no effect, leaving behind a blank piece of parchment.<br />
A wizard can use a <em>spell scroll</em> to copy the spell stored within to their spellbook by making an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + the spell’s level). Whether the check succeeds or not, the attempt destroys the <em>spell scroll</em>.<br />
The level of the spell stored within a scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s crafting components, cost, and rarity, as per the Spell Scrolls table. The costs of a <em>spell scroll</em> are in addition to any material components, which are required (and if necessary also consumed) when the scroll is made.</p>

<h2>Sphere of Annihilation</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (cost 100,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Materials:</strong> Opal charged with positive planar energy, onyx charged with negative planar energy<br />
This floating sphere of darkness is a 2-foot-diameter hole in reality that eliminates all matter that comes into contact with it. Only artifacts can survive contact with the sphere, though some artifacts have a specific weakness to its properties.<br />
Anything that the sphere touches or that touches it that isn’t instantly obliterated takes 4d10 force damage. The default state of the sphere is stationary, but a creature in the way of a moving sphere must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d10 force damage.<br />
While within 60 feet of an uncontrolled <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check to take control of it. On a success, the sphere moves in the direction of your choice a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you instead. If the sphere is controlled by another creature, you can wrest away control by using an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the controlling creature. On a success, you take control of the sphere.<br />
If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal or extradimensional space (such as a <em>portable hole</em>), the Narrator rolls a d100: on 1–50 the sphere is destroyed, on 51–85 the sphere moves through the portal or into the space, and on 86–100 a rift forms that pulls in all creatures and objects within 180 feet. Each object and creature, including the sphere, reappears in a random plane of existence.</p>
<h2>Spindle of Spinning</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 300 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> An item that caused a humanoid’s accidental death<br />
You can use an action to stab with this spindle, treating it as a magical improvised weapon and making a melee weapon attack against a creature within reach. On a hit, you deal 1 piercing damage and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall into a magical slumber (as the <em>sleep</em> spell) for 2d4 hours. A sleeping creature awakens when it takes damage or if it hears a loud noise within 50 feet of it.<br />
This enchanted slumber is infectious through touch. When a creature uses an action to try and shake or slap the sleeper awake, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall asleep for 1d4 hours.<br />
The needle breaks when you roll a 1 on a weapon attack roll using it, dispersing its sleep magic in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall asleep.</p>
<h2>Spirit Lantern</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (cost 1,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Essence of an incorporeal creature<br />
When you use a bonus action to speak this lantern’s command word, the lantern creates a magical bluish flame that emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This light outlines ethereal creatures within 40 feet and invisible creatures within 10 feet.</p>
<h2>Staff of Charming</h2>

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: <em>charm person</em> (1 charge), <em>command</em> (1 charge), <em>comprehend languages</em> (1 charge).<br />
When you fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell while holding the staff, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you’ve used this property, it can’t be used again for 24 hours.<br />
When you succeed on a saving throw against an enchantment spell (with or without the staff’s intervention) you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn back the spell on its caster (targeting only them), as if you had cast the spell.<br />
When you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties.</p>
<h2>Staff of Fire</h2>
<p><em>Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard; cost 15,000 gp)</em><br />

<h2>Staff of the Python</h2>
<p><em>Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock; cost 500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Scales of a snake who consorted with hags<br />
You can use an action to speak this staff’s command word and throw it at a point on the ground within 10 feet, transforming it into a <strong>giant constrictor snake</strong>. During your turn, while you aren’t incapacitated and remain within 60 feet of the snake, you can mentally command the snake. The snake acts immediately after you. You decide where the snake moves and what actions it takes, or you can issue it a general command, such as to guard a location.<br />
As a bonus action, you can transform the snake back into a staff by repeating the command word. The staff appears in a space formerly occupied by the snake. If the snake has at least 1 hit point when it becomes a staff, it regains all its hit points.<br />
If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, reverting to staff form before shattering into pieces.</p>
<h2>Staff of the Web-Tender</h2>

You can affect one additional spider for each additional charge expended.<br />
You can use an action to expend 5 charges to summon a <strong>phase spider</strong>, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The spider is friendly to you and your companions, and it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the spider only defends itself. The spider disappears when reduced to 0 hit points or 1 hour after you summoned it.<br />
When you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff transforms into hundreds of harmless Tiny spiders that wander away.</p>
<h2>Staff of the Woodlands</h2>
<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Branch from an awakened tree<br />
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic quarterstaff. In addition, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.<br />
While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast <em>pass without trace</em>. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges at dawn.

The tree is 60 feet tall, has a 5-foot-wide trunk, and its highest branches fill a 20-foot radius. The tree looks ordinary but radiates faint transmutation magic if inspected with <em>detect magic</em>. By using an action to touch the tree and speak the staff’s command word, you can transform it back into a staff. Creatures in the tree fall when the staff reverts to its original form.<br />
When you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties.</p>
<h2>Staff of Thunder and Lightning</h2>
<p><em>Staff, very rare (requires attunement; cost 12,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Metal struck by a storm giant’s lightning<br />
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic quarterstaff. Additionally, while holding it you can activate one of the following properties, each of which can be used once per dawn.<br />
<strong><em>Lightning.</em></strong> When you hit a target with a melee attack using the staff, you deal an additional 2d6 lightning damage.<br />
<strong><em>Thunder.</em></strong> When you hit a target with a melee attack using the staff, you cause the staff to emit a thunderclap audible up to 300 feet away. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.<br />
<strong><em>Lightning Strike.</em></strong> You can use an action to fire a 120-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of lightning from the staff. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.<br />
<strong><em>Thunderclap.</em></strong> You can use an action to create a thunderous roar audible up to 600 feet away. Each creature other than you within 60 feet makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn’t deafened.<br />
<strong><em>Thunder and Lightning.</em></strong> You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties simultaneously. This doesn’t expend the uses of those properties, only this one.</p>
<h2>Staff of Withering</h2>
<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock; cost 5,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Remains of a creature killed by the <em>blight</em> spell<br />
This magic quarterstaff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges at dawn. When you hit a target with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an additional 2d10 necrotic damage. The target then makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target makes Strength and Constitution checks and saving throws with disadvantage for 1 hour.</p>
<h2>Star Heart</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 76,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Corpse of a darkmantle and metal that has fallen from space<br />
Once you are attuned to the <em>star heart</em>, it attaches to your skin over your heart. As long as you have at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes. If you lose a body part, over the next 1d6 + 1 days the part completely regrows and regains full functionality, provided you have at least 1 hit point throughout that time.<br />
In addition, after 1d4 + 3 days, any body part you lose grows into an entirely new version of yourself, complete with your personality, memory, and abilities. This clone is independent and sentient, although it is incapable of further duplication. Each time a clone is created, one of the <em>star heart’s</em> five legs withers and dies, although the <em>star heart</em> regrows that leg if the associated clone dies.<br />
If all five of the <em>star heart’s</em> legs grow into clones, the <em>star heart</em> is destroyed.<br />
<strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> Every time the <em>star heart</em> creates a clone, roll a d20 and consult the Star Heart Clone table. On a result of 12 or higher, roll again and apply all effects.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">There is a darkness within the clone that makes it want to replace you. No matter how perfect the copy, the clone always attacks you on sight with the intent to kill (at the Narrator’s discretion, the clone might delay such an act if it would be immediately beneficial to the clone—once the benefit is gone, the bloodlust returns). The clone plots against you when not in your presence, hiring assassins or otherwise attempting to vex or destroy you. Note that particular mental stress effects don’t stack. For example, if the clone has both a personality change and develops a phobia, it only needs to make a single DC 14 Wisdom check when it sees you.</td>

The cloak has 3 charges and regains 3 expended charges at dawn. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to spin the cloak into the path of the attack. The cloak hardens like a shield, increasing your AC by 4 against that attack.</p>

<h2>Sun Blade</h2>

This weapon appears to be nothing more than a sword hilt. While holding the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of sunlight appear from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear.

In addition, you can speak the sword’s command word to make the blade shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light an additional 10 feet. Repeating the command word or sheathing the sword extinguishes the blade’s light.</p>

<h2>That Which Spies From Infinity’s True Name</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement; cost 150 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Parchment that has never been exposed to sunlight<br />
While holding this slip of parchment, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name Holtrathamogg to summon a vision of a dark and tentacled elder evil beside you. The vision remains for 1 minute. Once you summon the vision, it can’t be summoned again for 24 hours.<br />

</ul>
<p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on That Which Spies From Infinity in exchange for its direct assistance. When you do so the parchment melts away into nothing and for the next minute the vision transforms into an eldritch, ethereal tentacle that appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally instruct the tentacle to make a melee spell attack (+6 bonus to hit) against a target within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke That Which Spies From Infinity’s true name again.</p>

This tome’s pages fill with serialized stories that engage and distract the reader. Each tome focuses on a given genre (often romance or adventure), but the stories crafted within the pages are unique to each reader, tailored by the magic from their own imagination.<br />
Each tome has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges at dawn. When you use an action to speak the tome’s command word and expend 1 charge, the tome’s pages fill with a serial story tailored to the next creature that touches the tome. This story typically takes 1 hour to read.<br />
Alternatively, you can use an action to speak another command word and expend 3 charges. If you do, the story created is particularly engrossing. The next creature to open the tome must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that can’t read automatically succeed on the save. On a failure, the creature is enthralled by the tome for 1 hour. While enthralled, the creature fails to notice anything that isn’t directly harmful to it.<br />

<h2>Unliving Rune</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 75 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Gilded manuscript ruined by giant octopus ink<br />
An unliving rune is a Tiny construct of negative energy resembling a splotch of darkly glowing ink. The rune can be applied to your skin much like a temporary tattoo. While the rune is attached, you can channel negative energy into an attack. When you hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to activate the rune, dealing an additional 1d4 necrotic damage and preventing the target from regaining hit points until the start of your next turn. You can’t do so again until you finish a rest.<br />
The rune feeds on your vitality while attached to your skin. You gain a slightly sickly appearance, and the rune consumes one of your Hit Dice each dawn. During a short rest, you can deal yourself 1d6 necrotic damage to peel the rune off your skin. While unattached, the rune can be stored in a book instead of your skin, but it offers no benefit unless attached to you. When exposed to direct sunlight for a minute or more, the rune is destroyed.<br />
As an action, you can place the rune on a humanoid corpse that has died within the last 8 hours. The rune is destroyed as its magic is absorbed by the corpse, which then animates as a <strong>zombie</strong>. When placing the rune, you can feed it a portion of your life force by spending hit points. The zombie obeys your spoken commands and is friendly to you and your companions for 1 round per hit point you spend while placing the rune. At the end of this duration, the zombie becomes hostile to all living creatures.<br />
<strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> While you are attached to the <em>unliving rune</em>, any senses or divinations that detect undead incorrectly identify you as undead. If you die while the rune is attached to you, you are reanimated as a <strong>zombie</strong> after 1d4 rounds.</p>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Piece of a broken <em>sword of sharpness</em> or a piece of a broken <em>+3 sword</em><br />
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword. Damage dealt by the sword ignores resistance to slashing damage.<br />
When you use this sword to make an attack against a creature and roll a natural 20 on the attack roll, the sword makes a snicker-snack sound as it chops off one of the target’s heads. If the creature can’t survive without its head, it dies. This property doesn’t function if the target is too big for its head to be removed by the sword (as determined by the Narrator), if it doesn’t have a head or doesn’t need one, if it has immunity to slashing damage, or if it has legendary actions. In such cases, the target instead takes an additional 6d8 slashing damage (unless it is immune to slashing damage; this extra damage does not double).</p>

<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Grave goods stolen from the tomb of an infamous tyrant<br />
This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges at dawn.

Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. While frightened, the target can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.

When you take the Attack action, you can choose an object or surface within 60 feet, making one of your attacks against it (AC 10). On a hit, <em>Warpblade</em> embeds into the target. While <em>Warpblade</em> is embedded, you can use a reaction to instantly teleport yourself to an unoccupied space adjacent to it and remove it from the target. Alternatively, on your turn you can instantly return <em>Warpblade</em> to your hand (no action required).<br />
<em>Warpblade</em> has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast the following spells: <em>misty step</em> (1 charge), <em>dimension door</em> (2 charges), <em>teleport</em> (3 charges).</p>

<h2>Waystone</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 50 gp each)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Stone kept in a traveler’s pocket throughout a journey of at least 100 miles<br />
When one or more <em>waystones</em> are kept in contact with each other for at least an hour, they become linked and magnetically attracted to each other for 7 days per hour the stones remained in contact. While holding a <em>waystone</em>, you can use an action to speak the stone’s command word, causing it to be drawn toward the nearest <em>waystone</em> within 5 miles. If the <em>waystone</em> is linked, it is instead drawn to the nearest <em>waystone</em> linked to it, regardless of distance. Linked <em>waystones</em> are only able to sense each other. Once activated, the <em>waystone’s</em> attraction lasts until the next dawn.<br />
A <em>waystone</em> has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge at dawn. You can expend 1 charge to speak the stone’s command word to increase an unlinked <em>waystone</em>’s range to 25 miles. If you expend the last charge, the <em>waystone</em> becomes a mundane object.</p>
<h2></h2>

<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (cost 75,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Tuning fork that has been attuned to each of the planes of existence<br />
When unfolded, this handkerchief-sized piece of lightweight, silky fabric expands into a 6-foot-diameter circular sheet.<br />
You can use an action to unfold the cloth and spread it on a solid surface, creating a two-way portal to another plane of existence chosen by the Narrator. You can use an action to close the portal by folding the cloth. Once a portal has been opened in this manner, it can’t be opened again for 1d8 hours.</p>
<h2>Wig of Styling</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 15 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Full head of hair shaved from an elf<br />
This wig has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. While wearing the wig, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to change the length, style, and color of the wig. If you expend the wig’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wig is fixed in its current length, style, and color, becoming a mundane object.</p>
<h2>Wind Fan</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (cost 450 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Air from the Plane of Air, gilded songbird feather<br />
You can use an action to wave this fan to cast <em>gust of wind</em> (save DC 13). Each time the fan is used before the next dawn, there is a cumulative 20 percent chance that the fan shreds into nonmagical pieces, causing the spell to fail.</p>

<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement; cost 1,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Couatl feather<br />
While wearing these boots, you gain a fly speed equal to your Speed, and you can hover. You can use the boots to fly for up to 2 hours, expending at least 10 minutes’ worth of time with each use. If you’re flying when the time runs out, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round and take no damage upon landing.<br />
The boots regain 1 hour of flying time for every 12 hours they’re not in use.</p>
<h2>Wings of Flying</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 3,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Nalfeshnee feather or planetar feather<br />
While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word and transform the cloak into a pair of wings. The wings last for 1 hour or until you use an action to speak the command word to dismiss them. While the wings are activated, you gain a fly speed of 60 feet. After being used in this way, the wings disappear and can’t be used again for 2d6 hours.</p>
<h2>Wood Woad Amulet</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement, cost 90 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Wooden road sign stolen from a crossroads<br />
When you hold this amulet to your ear, you hear faint whispers. As an action, you can hold the amulet to your ear and let its whispers guide you. You gain an expertise die to one ability check you make in the next minute. You can roll the expertise die before or after making the ability check, after which the effect ends. Once you use this property, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.<br />
Alternatively, when you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use a reaction to crush the amulet to gain the “woad’s blessing.” If you do, roll an additional d20 and use either result. You can roll the additional die after making the roll, but you must choose to do so before the outcome is determined. Once you’ve used this property, the amulet’s magic dissipates.</p>
<h2>Zlick’s Message Cushion</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, common (cost 45 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Written joke responsible for at least 1 minute of genuine laughter<br />
While holding this small pink air bladder, you can use a bonus action to whisper a phrase up to 10 words long into the cushion, which will inflate it. While inflated, any creature that accidentally sits on or applies pressure to the cushion deflates it. A creature can also use a bonus action to intentionally deflate the cushion. When the cushion deflates, it loudly repeats the phrase spoken into it along with somewhat humorous flatulence noise. This sound is audible to a range of 50 feet.<br />
Alternatively, you can cast a cantrip or 1st-level spell into the <em>Zlick’s message cushion</em>, provided the word “laughter,” “mockery,” or “whisper” is in the spell’s name. When deflated, the cushion casts the spell, targeting the creature that deflated it. Once the spell is cast, the cushion becomes a mundane object.</p>
<h1>Sentient Magic Items</h1>
<p>Some magic items are sentient and sapient, possessed by a spirit or given life through arcane power. Despite their outward appearances these objects are full fledged characters with their own agendas, desires, and personalities. Unless otherwise specified, sentient items are NPCs under the Narrator’s control, and adventurers must negotiate with and become allies to them rather than simply use them as items. A sentient item’s properties and abilities are under their own control rather than the wielder’s, and accessing them requires the item’s willing cooperation.</p>
<h2>Ability Scores</h2>
<p>Sentient magic items have a mind and so also possess mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). Each sentient item has these ability scores defined in their descriptions, and is capable of making checks and saving throws just like any other creature.<br />
Unless otherwise specified, sentient magic items don’t possess a typical body and thus usually don’t have Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. These sentient items automatically fail any checks or saving throws made for these ability scores.</p>
<h2>Durability and Hit Points</h2>
<p>Most magic items are already far more durable than their mundane counterparts but the enchantments required to encapsulate a sentient mind must be steadfastly reinforced. Some sentient magic items have hit points listed within their description along with other statistics normal for a creature. Sentient magic items without hit points can only be broken by special and specific means detailed within the item’s description.</p>
<h2>Senses and Communication</h2>
<p>Sentient magic items rely on magical senses and forms of communication that can vary wildly between items. Some items may be able to communicate telepathically with their wielder or see with extranormal senses, or they may be severely limited in their capacity to interact with the world around them. Each sentient magic item’s description details its unique sense and communication abilities. Unless otherwise specified, assume that a sentient magic item can at least speak and understand Common, and can see and hear its surroundings as a typical humanoid creature would.</p>
<h2>Personality and Conflict</h2>
<p>Just like any NPC, sentient magic items have their own unique personality. Some have very specific goals in mind, while others may operate on guidelines or ideals. Sentient magic items can be as deep and complex as any character with intricate backstories and motivations that cannot be summarized by a single attribute or phrase. However, most sentient magic items have some issue or trait that can lead to conflict.<br />
While a sentient magic item and a creature wielding it are not in conflict, the wielder has access to the abilities and properties of the sentient magic item.<br />
While a sentient magic item and a creature wielding it are in conflict, the wielder may lose access to some or all of the sentient magic item’s abilities, and the sentient magic item may even be able to inflict additional negative effects or influence the wielder’s actions.<br />
Exactly what leads to conflict, what happens during conflict, and how these conflicts can be resolved depends on the personality of the sentient magic item (detailed in its description).<br />
For example, a lance containing the soul of a righteous cleric might deal radiant damage to its wielder whenever it is used to commit an evil act, and will refuse to function for that wielder until that evil act is atoned for. Alternatively, a staff haunted by an arrogant wizard may refuse to attune to a wielder unless flattered with a high Charisma check, forcibly ending the attunement if it feels unappreciated or insulted.</p>
<h2>Creating Sentient Magic Items</h2>
<p>Creating a sentient magic item has elements of both character creation and item creation. Use the Backgrounds, Cultures, and perhaps even the Destinies in Chapter 2: Origins to develop their personality and the information elsewhere in this chapter to create the sentient magic item’s traits and other statistics. In addition, make sure to include the following features:<br />
<strong>Sentience:</strong> Include the item’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The Narrator can simply select these scores or determine them randomly by rolling 4d6 for each, dropping the lowest roll and totalling the rest.<br />
Then, describe how the item communicates and what languages it knows. Some common forms of communication include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telepathy with the wielder or others.  </li>
<li>An actual audible voice.  </li>
<li>Vague impulses and feelings empathically transmitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally you’ll need to describe how aware the item is of its surroundings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vision common to most humanoids.  </li>
<li>Darkvision.  </li>
<li>Blindsight.  </li>
<li>Shared awareness using the wielder’s senses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personality:</strong> The description of a sentient item’s personality can be a simple list of traits or as extensive as a full backstory. Whatever level of detail, the Narrator needs at least some indication of the item’s motivations, what will bring the item into conflict, the repercussions of conflict and how to resolve it.<br />
Common causes of conflict include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going directly against the item’s values.  </li>
<li>Fighting against creatures aligned with<br />
  the item.  </li>
<li>Insulting or causing the item injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common repercussions of conflict include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damaging the wielder.  </li>
<li>Blocking access to one or more of the<br />
  item’s features.  </li>
<li>Attempting to control the wielder temporarily through a battle of wills, resolved with a contested Charisma check.  </li>
<li>Forcibly ending attunement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common resolutions of conflict include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apologizing with a high Persuasion check.  </li>
<li>Bringing current actions back in line with the item’s values.  </li>
<li>Performing tasks or favors that benefit<br />
  the item.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Sample Sentient Items</h1>
<h2>Eye of Elsewhere</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 55,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
This gray stone orb is carved into the likeness and size of a disquietingly realistic human eye with a ruby iris. Once you have attuned to it you can use an action to set the eye in a gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature may use an action to try and take an orbiting eye, but must make a melee attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The eye’s AC is 24, it has 30 hit points, and resistance to all damage. While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an action to seize and stow the eye, returning it to an inert and inactive state.<br />
While the eye is actively orbiting your head, your Intelligence score increases by 2 (to a maximum of 22), you gain an expertise die on Intelligence checks and Perception checks, and you cannot be surprised or blinded.<br />
<strong>Innate Arcane Eye.</strong> While the eye orbits your head, you know and can innately cast <em>arcane eye</em> without expending a spell slot or the need for material components.<br />
<strong>Shared Paranoia.</strong> After you have attuned to the eye and it has been and active for 24 hours, you develop a paranoia that persists as long as it remains active. While paranoid you have disadvantage on Insight checks and you are considered roughing it if you sleep in the same room or tent as another humanoid creature.<br />
<strong>Sentience.</strong> The eye is a sentient construct with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 8. It cannot hear, but has blindsight and darkvision to a range of 60 feet. The eye communicates with you and other creatures within 60 feet telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Abyssal, Common, Deep Speech, and Undercommon.<br />
<strong>Personality</strong>. The <em>eye of elsewhere</em> contains the soul of something utterly alien to humanoid perceptions, betrayed and plunged into a constrained form. It is constantly paranoid and convinced that some worse fate could befall it at any moment. Once attuned it will try to learn everything and anything you know, especially secrets. If you are forthcoming with information the eye grows to trust you, but can be brought into conflict if you withhold any information. When in conflict the eye shuts and you no longer gain any of the eye’s benefits or properties except for Shared Paranoia. The eye only opens again if you divulge an important secret or the information initially withheld.<br />
<strong>Destroying the Eye</strong>. The eye is unbreakable but it has the power to implode and disintegrate itself. Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces the eye that some horrifying and frightening threat is inevitably soon to befall it. Rather than accept its fate, the eye destroys itself and blinks out of existence. On a failed check, the creature permanently loses the eye’s trust and the eye will never attune to it or be convinced by its Deception checks.</p>
<h2>Fellow Candlestick</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement;</em><br />
<em>cost 3,500 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
This golden candlestick is sentient but will only light when held by someone it is friendly with—perhaps that someone is you. Whether or not the candlestick will accept you as an ally is at the Narrator’s discretion, though it is highly recommended to keep it well-polished and speak to it once per day to encourage a long-lasting friendship. Once you have befriended the candlestick you are able to attune to it.<br />
While you are attuned to the candlestick, you can use a bonus action to politely ask it to light itself or extinguish its flame. If another force extinguishes its flame, the candlestick relights itself at the start of your next turn unless told otherwise.<br />
<strong>Hydrophobic.</strong> The candlestick does not like exposure to water or having its candle replaced, and when either occurs it stops functioning for you until you make a DC 14 Persuasion check to earn its forgiveness.<br />
<strong>Sentience.</strong> The candlestick is a sentient construct with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 10, and Charisma 18. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The candlestick communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfling. It cannot read (or perhaps it is simply disinterested in doing so).<br />
<strong>Personality</strong>. The candlestick’s purpose is to provide ample lighting for its wielder and snuff itself out should the cover of darkness be required. It is sympathetic to those in need of assistance but demands to be treated with a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.<br />
<strong>Destroying the Candlestick</strong>. When reduced to 0 hit points, the candlestick pours its remaining heart and soul into creating one last burst of flames before becoming a mundane item. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the candlestick must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Harvest</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (sickle), legendary (requires attunement by a druid or ranger; cost 60,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
This seems like nothing more than a simple tool at first, rough at the handle and rusted at the edges, but the sickle’s impossibly sharp and shining crescent blade reveals its true nature.<br />
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sickle. It has the following additional properties.<br />
<strong>Red Reaping.</strong> Whenever you use <em>Harvest</em> to reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs that creature’s soul and stores it within. <em>Harvest</em> cannot store more than one soul in this way and the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit points while a creature’s soul is already contained within it are not affected by this property.<br />
<strong>Sow the Reaped.</strong> You can use an action to strike the ground with the sickle and produce a blood clone using a creature’s soul stored within <em>Harvest.</em> This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones formed in this way act immediately after you in initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to the best of their ability. Without such commands, the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed, a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10 minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever afterlife was intended for it.<br />
<strong>Only Life May Die.</strong> <em>Harvest</em> has no effect on unliving creatures, and passes harmlessly through constructs and undead when it is used to attack them.<br />
<strong>Sentience.</strong> <em>Harvest</em> is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17. It sees and hears using your senses. <em>Harvest</em> communicates with only you telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is not attuned to.<br />
<strong>Personality</strong>. <em>Harvest</em> has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. <em>Harvest</em> tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its “culling”. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth’s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using <em>Harvest</em> to slay a sentient creature, you’ll be in conflict with <em>Harvest</em>. When in conflict, any time you use the <em>Sow the Reaped</em> property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into <em>Harvest</em>.<br />
<strong>Destroying Harvest</strong>. <em>Harvest</em> is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering <em>Harvest</em> an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade.</p>
<h2>Skrivena Moc, Whispering Blade</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (longsword), legendary (cost 80,000 gp)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
A huge red ruby is set into the pommel of this intricately filigreed golden longsword. The jewel shimmers and shines as the blade speaks in a voice that resonates with a deep and distant baritone. Without this illusion, a twisted demonic form is revealed: the blade is composed of a single sharpened tooth, what appears to be the hilt is instead a grotesque sucker-like mouth, and the ruby pommel is a figment covering a single great crimson eye that stares with fiendish intelligence.<br />
You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic longsword. An intense burning heat radiates from the blade and it deals an extra 3d6 fire damage on a successful hit.<br />
<strong>Attached Properties.</strong> While attached to <em>Skrivena Moc</em>, you gain resistance to fire, proficiency with longswords, and after taking the Attack action on your turn you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using it. However, the weapon forms a permanent bond with its wielder and cannot be put down or removed once wielded.<br />
<strong>Corruption.</strong> At the end of each week that <em>Skrivena Moc</em> is attached to you, your Charisma score is decreased by 1d4. When you have lost 6 or more Charisma in this way, raised black veins radiate out from the point of <em>Skrivena Moc</em>’s attachment. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until <em>Skrivena Moc</em> is no longer attached to you, at which point you recover 1 Charisma at the end of each long rest.<br />
<strong>Fiend Transformed.</strong> This elegantly crafted longsword of filigreed gold whispers promises of greater treasures to come—yet those who wield it are doomed. In truth it is an imprisoned balor reduced in power by potent enchantments, the elegant blade only an illusion. Any that dare grasp the infernal hilt know not their peril, unaware they are actually plunging their hand into a fiendish maw.<br />
<strong><em>Sentience.</em><em> Skrivena Moc</em> is a sentient construct with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 16, and Charisma 22. It has hearing and truesight to a range of 120 feet. The longsword communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Abyssal, Common, and up to 3 other languages of the Narrator’s choice.<br />
</strong><em>Personality.</em><em> Skrivena Moc</em> needs a wielder to accomplish much of anything and it is a peerless manipulator. Wrathful and vindictive, the fiend blade sees those who carry it as insignificant and a means to an end. However it has been stuck in this form for centuries and has learned to maintain a helpful and subservient façade to better facilitate the careful orchestration of events whenever possible, only revealing its true intentions as a last resort. Once wielded, the fiend blade grabs hold and cannot be dropped. The demon makes hasty apologies for its “curse”, manipulating its wielder into serving its will—it acts as a powerful weapon but slowly drains away their vital essences until they die, all the while using them to track down potential cures for its transformation.</p>

<strong><em>Death Throes.</em></strong> When Skrivena Moc dies it explodes and each creature within 30 feet of it make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success. The explosion ignites unattended flammable objects in the area. Any creature currently attached to Skrivena Moc has disadvantage on this save.<br />
<strong><em>Demonic Blade.</em></strong> While Skrivena Moc is attached to a creature, the creature gains the attached template.<br />
<strong><em>Immobile.</em></strong> Skrivena Moc has been magically forced into the form of a blade and is unable to move on its own. It is considered restrained and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws.<br />
<strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> Skrivena Moc has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br />
<strong><em>Prized Glamer.</em></strong> Skrivena Moc has an illusion around it that makes it look and feel like a golden longsword. Creatures who physically interact with the figment can determine that the sword is glamered with a DC 22 Arcana or Investigation check. Skrivena Moc can use a bonus action to activate or dismiss this illusion.<br />
<strong><em>Variable Challenge Rating.</em></strong> Skrivena Moc’s CR is equal to its wielder’s level or CR (min. CR 4).<br />
ACTIONS<br />
<strong><em>Corrupting Siphon (Recharge 5–6).</em></strong> The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or reduces its Charisma by 2 (1d4). Skrivena Moc regains 1d8 hit points for each point of Charisma lost in this way. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until Skrivena Moc is no longer attached to the creature, at which point it recovers 1 Charisma at the end of each long rest.<br />
<strong><em>Demonic Leeching (3/Day).</em></strong> Skrivena Moc uses its natural resistances to filter out its wielder’s ailments, ending either the poisoned condition or one nonmagical disease afflicting the attached creature.<br />
<strong><em>Grip of Control.</em></strong> The creature attached to Skrivena Moc must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or temporarily lose control to the fiend blade until the end of Skrivena Moc’s next turn (as <em>dominate person</em>).<br />
<strong><em>Trusty Blade.</em></strong> The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is charmed for the next hour. If the attached creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.<br />
REACTIONS<br />
<strong><em>Fiendish Attachment.</em></strong> When a creature grasps Skrivena Moc’s hilt, it can use reaction to attach to the creature. Once attached, the creature cannot let go and is forced to wield Skrivena Moc with whatever limb it used to grab the hilt. Skrivena Moc can use an action to detach from a creature and otherwise detaches when it dies, the attached limb is severed, or if it is dealt 35 or more radiant damage in a single round.<br />
<strong><em>Justified Paranoia.</em></strong> Whenever Skrivena Moc hears its name mentioned or is otherwise suspicious of a creature, it can use its reaction to telepathically delve into the creature’s mind (as <em>detect thoughts</em>; save DC 19).</p>
<p>The Traveling Chest<br />
<em>Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement; cost 52,000 gp)</em><br />
Crafting Components: Unique (uncraftable)<br />
This large chest has an interior space 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall, and appears mundane save that the wood used in its construction is normally reserved for making magic wands. Its magical properties become apparent however when it moves, as it stands on hundreds of tiny humanoid legs and opens to reveal a long red tongue and a rim dotted with sharp teeth. It functions like a typical chest with the following additional properties.<br />
<strong><em>Mimic-Like.</em><em> The Traveling Chest</em> can use an action to appear to be a mundane chest, and you can verbally command it to do so. While mimicking a normal chest in this way it is indistinguishable from its mundane counterpart.<br />
</strong><em>Multiple Interiors.</em><strong> <em>The Traveling Chest* has 1,000 different interior spaces, each 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall. You can verbally request any particular space (such as the last one, or the one with my laundry in it) and when opened the chest reveals that interior. Otherwise the chest opens to reveal a random interior space. While the chest is closed, all of its interior spaces are located within separate pocket dimensions. These pocket dimensions have no air, and any Supply stored within them instantly deteriorates and rots as if decades have passed as soon as the chest is closed. Only you can summon up the other interiors in this way, and any other creature that opens the chest only finds the “first interior”.<br />
</em></strong>Relentless.<strong><em> Once you attune to </em>The Traveling Chest*, it relentlessly follows you until it sits no more than 15 feet away from you. The chest is magically aware of your location at all times, even if you are on a separate plane. If separated from you the chest travels towards you as fast as it can to the best of its ability and it attacks any creature that attempts to hinder its progress. If you are functionally unreachable, such as being on a different plane or across an ocean, the chest still progresses using even esoteric or hidden methods of reaching you such as magic portals or stowing away on ships headed in your direction.<br />
</strong><em>Imprinted.</em><strong> <em>The Traveling Chest<em> does not relinquish attunement once attuned, and you cannot voluntarily remove this attunement. If you attune to additional magic items beyond your limit, </em>The Traveling Chest* always remains as one of your attuned items.<br />
</em></strong>Pack Lightly.<strong> The Traveling Chest<em> does not like being weighed down too much, and can carry a maximum of 10 bulky items. Any additional bulky items you attempt to store within it are spit out.<br />
</em></strong>Sentience.<strong> The Traveling Chest<em> is a sentient construct with Intelligence 3, Wisdom 14, and Charisma 12. It has blindsight to a range of 60 feet. <em>The Traveling Chest</em> cannot speak or read, but it understands Common and Elvish. <em>The Traveling Chest</em> lacks proper communication, but can animalistically communicate simple emotions (most often boredom or rage).<br />
</em></strong>Personality*<em><em>. </em>The Traveling Chest</em> has the intellect and temperament of a poorly trained dog. Loyalty has been branded magically into its psyche but its actual obedience is looser. The chest is playful and quick to anger, yet is utterly committed to following whomever is attuned to it. It also isn’t a fighter and ignores outright commands to attack, though it defends itself in combat when it is attacked. It likes to be used for its intended purpose, happiest when numerous items are stored within it and regularly retrieved. If left idle or unused for more than a day it will come into conflict. While in conflict the chest intentionally opens to the wrong interior spaces, or remains indignantly locked, and it generally acts snippy and uncooperative. An apology and DC 14 Animal Handling or Persuasion check calms the chest down and ends the conflict, or if it feels genuinely mistreated, it can be offered a full wardrobe’s worth of new clothing to store as a peace offering.</p>

<strong><em>Immutable Form.</em></strong> The chest is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.<br />
ACTION<br />
<strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (3d8+4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the chest can’t bite another target.<br />
<strong><em>Swallow.</em></strong> The chest makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite’s damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the chest, and it begins suffocating at the start of each of the chest’s turns. If the chest takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the chest regurgitates all swallowed creatures along with up to 1d10 other random items that were stored within it, all of which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the chest. If the chest dies, all swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it, and they and any items reappear randomly in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the destroyed chest.</p>
<h1>Artifacts</h1>
<p>In a world of flaming swords and cursed axes, some magical items are on a level above and beyond what can be found in a wizard’s tower or a demon’s lair. These potent relics are the stuff of bard tales and cultural epics, unique and powerful items that leave marks upon history and spawn legends in their wake—when one of them is found, it can easily signal major changes felt far and wide.<br />
The appearance of an artifact in a campaign is not to be taken lightly. Artifacts are not typically found by everyday adventurers and are as much plot points as they are equipment. The search for an artifact can be the goal of an entire adventure or long term quest: to reclaim it from a villain, to traverse the dangerous demiplane of a demigod and acquire it, or even keeping it from two factions in a stalemate war.</p>
<h2>Recognizing Artifacts</h2>
<p>Due to their eminent place in history and the countless tales told about them, artifacts can often be recognized even without anyone realizing everything about the item. Success on an ability check to recognize an artifact reveals something from its Legends and Lore, but not anything a typical check to identify a magic item would reveal.</p>
<h2>Artifact Properties</h2>
<p>Artifacts have properties like other magical items, but these are of a greater magnitude than what the average adventurer will come across in their lifetime. In addition to their inherent abilities, artifacts may have other properties that can be either beneficial or detrimental, either chosen by the Narrator from the following tables or randomly determined. Properties such as these often shift each time an artifact appears and are not permanent. Narrators are also encouraged to create new properties.<br />
Artifact properties are either benefits or detriments and have one of two intensities (lesser or greater). An artifact can only have a maximum of four lesser benefits and two greater benefits, and no more than four lesser detriments and two greater detriments.<br />
Unless otherwise noted, the following properties apply when you have attuned to an artifact and are wielding it or have it on your person. Any cantrips or spells granted by an artifact are chosen by the Narrator.</p>

<h2>Destroying an Artifact</h2>
<p>The very heart of legends rests in the hands of the adventurers, yet they could well seek to destroy it—such a task might not be folly but absolutely necessary. The destruction of such a powerful magical item is a matter of a campaign’s plot, and otherwise artifacts are indestructible. Despite the enormous power they wield however, every artifact has its own weakness (though finding and utilizing such a vulnerability may be a quest in itself, as can stopping a villain from destroying an artifact).<br />
While the Narrator decides how a particular artifact can be destroyed, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fulfill an ancient prophecy—or defy one.  </li>
<li>Return it to its place of origin or creator to make it vulnerable to damage.  </li>
<li>Ritual that takes place at a sacred site in an opposite aligned plane.  </li>
<li>Thrown into a specific volcano tied to<br />
  its power.  </li>
<li>If sentient, it may desire an appropriate ritual or location to create a body of its own, leaving the artifact to dissipate into dust.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ancient Broom</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (club), artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
Subtle power is contained within this ancient oak staff and its coarse bristles, and though it appears as if any amount of rough handling will break this broom only the most potent blades have any chance of harming it. The broom’s handle is said to have come from the first tree and the bristles stolen from a god, but its beginnings are far more humble—just a simple mundane object that accrued its first enchantment by chance after years of exposure to countless rituals. Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names. Only the feats of magic they achieved are of any worth to the broom.<br />
<strong><em>Sentience.</em></strong> The broom is a sentient construct with Intelligence 19, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 17. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The broom communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon.<br />
<strong><em>Personality</em></strong>. The broom’s purpose is to encourage the use of magic—the more powerful the better—regardless of any consequences. It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.<br />
<strong><em>Demands.</em></strong> If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick). In addition, the broom is a repository of magic over the ages and it strongly encourages you to seek out monsters to harvest powerful reagents, explore cursed ruins in search of forbidden knowledge, and undertake precarious rituals.<br />
You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the magic broom, and when the broom deals damage with a critical hit the target is blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Ancient Broom</em>, used by spellcasters since the dawn of time.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The broom is able to animate itself and attack your enemies, it has the power to open locks and break shackles, and it enables you to move without leaving a trace of your passing.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> Many of those who have wielded the <em>Ancient Broom</em> came from humble and unlikely backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Ancient Broom</em> has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>While you are attuned to the broom you gain an expertise die on checks made with Arcana, and while holding it you can innately cast <em>pass without trace</em> (no concentration required) and <em>nondetection</em> at will.<br />
In addition, you can use a bonus action to knock the broom against a lock, door, lid, chains, shackles, or the like to open them. Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a short rest, learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.</p>
<h3>Dancing Broom</h3>
<p>In addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle. When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or invisible it has advantage on its attack roll.<br />
While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the broom to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.<br />
The broom ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.</p>
<h2>Cane of Chaos</h2>
<p><em>Staff, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> (known by some by its fairytale name, the Little Silver Stick) is a gorgeous silver scepter etched with fractals, adorned with an eight-pointed star, and imbued with the power of chaos. </p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Cane of Chaos</em>, used by a despot in times long past. It is also known as the Little Silver Stick.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The cane stores and is able to cast spells linked to chaos, but randomly unleashes chaotic magical effects when used.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The cane can only be destroyed by a sovereign on the day of their coronation.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> has 1d4 lesser artifact benefits, 1d4 lesser artifact detriments, 1d4–1 greater artifact benefits, and 1d4 + 1 greater artifact detriments.<br />
In addition, the cane has the finesse property and can be used as a double weapon which you become proficient with when you attune to it. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls and damage rolls made using the <em>Cane of Chaos</em>.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>While you use this quarterstaff as a spell focus, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC. You know and have prepared all spells of the chaos school of magic (but not their rare versions).<br />
The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> begins with a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus and regains 1d6 charges each dawn (to a maximum number of charges equal to your level + 1, or your CR + 1) . You can expend any number of charges from the cane to cast a chaos spell, which costs a number of charges equal to the spell’s level. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).<br />
When you expend charges from the <em>Cane of Chaos</em>, it unleashes another chaotic magical effect, either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined.</p>
<h3>Destroying the Cane</h3>
<p>The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> is born from the very essence of rebellion. To destroy it, you must offer the artifact as a gift to a sovereign on the day of their coronation or to a magical being with the Lawful alignment trait on the anniversary of their advent. If accepted as such a gift, the <em>Cane of Chaos</em> melts into a puddle of ordinary molten silver.</p>

<h2>Crafter’s Codex</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
Centuries ago, a famed artificer published her masterwork treatise on crafting magic items—humbly titled <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em>—and the work was so revolutionary that every serious library simply had to have a copy. The work still influences the art of crafting magic items to this day.<br />
A regular copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> is a masterwork book about crafting magic items. Yet a fabled version of this tome is said to meander through literary circles—a copy annotated by a mad genius. Known as the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em>, this copy of the book is dog-eared throughout and stuffed to the brim with exceedingly peculiar, illegible marginalia. To the person approaching the book through the right means (such as refracting the text through a beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one’s own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step instructions which streamline and improve the enchantments described within. Alas, no owner seems to hold on to the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> for long. The book itself appears to hyperfixate on a given reader and then simply disappear, presumably in search of someone more suited to its talents and disposition.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em>, a legendary book containing secrets of crafting magical items that can unsettle even the strongest minds.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> This book is a unique annotated version of the more common Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> can only be destroyed by destroying every copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> that exists in the multiverse.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. While attuned to this book, you gain an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the usual requirements related to crafting a magic item aside from its cost.<br />
In addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented around inventing, the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em>, or keeping the book safely in your possession.<br />
Once between long rests, while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, choose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce research time by 75%.  </li>
<li>Reduce component cost by 75%.  </li>
<li>Reduce crafting time by 75%.  </li>
<li>Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.  </li>
<li>Reduce a crafting DC by 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>After three failures on the Intelligence check, the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> moves on. You retain a copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> but the magic and marginalia of the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it<em>.</em> Any bonuses accrued remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first).</p>
<h3>Seekers of the Codex</h3>
<p>The <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> is coveted by collectors and ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> surely means encountering some of the following foes.</p>

<h3>Destruction</h3>
<p>When the artifact faces a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> is to eliminate every last copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> that exists in the multiverse—if even one copy remains, even on another plane of existence, the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> persists.</p>
<h2>Dread Caduceus</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
This heavy silver scepter has two heads, both cast in metal and staring out of glassy onyx eyes. One head is a skull, its jaw thrown open and its teeth unnaturally elongated. At the other end of the scepter is a cherubic human face that is turned upwards as though determined not to look at<br />
its sibling.<br />
While you are attuned to the <em>Dread Caduceus</em> you may use either end of the scepter to activate its powers.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Dread Caduceus</em>, a holy scepter with the power to raise the dead.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The cherub and skull heads cause healing and necromantic effects, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> Those who use the scepter risk having their very flesh corrupted and their souls devoured.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Dread Caduceus</em> has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.<br />
The <em>Dread Caduceus</em> warps your life energy, twisting your flesh as it corrupts that of others. While you are attuned to the scepter, your organs shift and twist, sticking to one another within you. Take 1d6 necrotic damage each dawn from this effect. This damage can only be healed by a long or short rest. You also have disadvantage on initiative rolls as you are distracted by this tangible shifting within.<br />
The <em>Dread Caduceus</em> has 2d10 charges and regains 1d10 charges each dawn. When you reduce the <em>Dread Caduceus</em> to 0 charges, you take 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you instantly die and cannot be resurrected (even by a <em>wish</em> spell).</p>
<h3>Cherub</h3>
<p>You can use an action and expend charges from the <em>Dread Caduceus</em> to cause one of the following effects to extend from the cherub head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 30 feet:<br />
<strong>Heal.</strong> The creature regains 1d8+1 hit points for each expended charge.<br />
<strong>Healing Nimbus (3 Charges).</strong> A nimbus of healing appears around the creature for 1d6 rounds. For the duration, whenever the creature takes damage from an attack it regains 1 hit point, and when an attack misses the creature it regains 1d4 hit points.<br />
<strong>Invulnerability (3 Charges).</strong> The creature becomes immune to damage from nonmagical attacks for 1d4 rounds.<br />
<strong>Exhaustless (5 Charges).</strong> The creature becomes immune to fatigue for 1d6 days.<br />
<strong>Resistance (5 Charges).</strong> The creature becomes resistant to one type of damage of your choice for 1d6 rounds. This property has no effect if the creature already has resistance to that damage type.<br />
<strong>Cure (10 Charges).</strong> The creature is healed of any curses, diseases, poisons, or other negative effects, even if a wish spell has previously been unsuccessful.<br />
<strong>Invigorate (10 Charges).</strong> The creature permanently increases its maximum hit points by 1d8+1. A creature can only benefit from this property once.</p>
<h3>Skull</h3>
<p>You can use an action and expend charges from the <em>Dread Caduceus</em> to cause one of the following effects to extend from the skull head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 100 feet:<br />
<strong>Animate Skeleton (1 Charge).</strong> You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating the skeleton of its body to serve at your whim. The creature gains the skeleton template and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the Dread Caduceus.<br />
<strong>Animate Zombie (2 Charges).</strong> You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating it as a zombie to serve at your whim. The creature gains the zombie template and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the <em>Dread Caduceus</em>.<br />
<strong>Empower Undead (2 Charges).</strong> Choose 1d6 undead that you can see within range. Whenever one of the chosen undead makes a weapon attack it deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. Even on a miss, the undead deals 1d4 necrotic damage.<br />
<strong>Animate Legion (6 Charges).</strong> You return 3d10 dead humanoids to a semblance of life, transforming their corpses into zombies.<br />
You can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead you create using the <em>Dread Caduceus</em>. When you command multiple undead, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete.<br />
In addition, any creature you animate in this fashion retains injuries or disfigurements that were upon its corpse, and it continues to decompose.</p>
<h3>Skeleton Template</h3>
<p>A skeleton creature retains all its statistics except as noted below.<br />
<strong><em>Type.</em></strong> The skeleton’s type is undead. It does not require air, sleep, or sustenance.<br />
<strong><em>Ability Scores.</em></strong> The skeleton’s Intelligence becomes 6 (–2), its Wisdom becomes 8 (–1), and its Charisma becomes 5 (–3).<br />
<strong><em>Skills.</em></strong> The skeleton loses all skill proficiencies.<br />
<strong><em>Vulnerability.</em></strong> The skeleton gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.<br />
<strong><em>Immunities.</em></strong> The skeleton gains immunity to poison damage and to the fatigue and poisoned conditions.<br />
<strong><em>Senses.</em></strong> The skeleton gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.<br />
<strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> The skeleton understands the languages it knew in life but can’t speak. It can’t take any action that requires speech or vocalization.<br />
<strong><em>Magical Abilities.</em></strong> The skeleton loses all spellcasting ability and any actions which have magical effects.<br />
<strong><em>Traits.</em></strong> The skeleton loses all traits.</p>
<h2>Zombie Template</h2>
<p>A zombie creature retains all its statistics except as noted below.<br />
<strong><em>Type.</em></strong> The zombie’s type is undead. It does not require air, sustenance, or sleep.<br />
<strong><em>Ability Scores.</em></strong> The zombie’s Intelligence becomes 3 (–4), its Wisdom becomes 8 (–1), and its Charisma becomes 5 (–3).<br />
<strong><em>Saving Throws.</em></strong> The zombie loses all saving throw proficiencies.<br />
<strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Any speed the creature has is reduced by 10 feet, or to 30 feet (whichever is lower).<br />

<strong><em>Senses.</em></strong> The zombie gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.<br />
<strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> The zombie understands the languages it knew in life but can’t speak. It can’t take any action that requires speech or vocalization.<br />
<strong><em>Magical Abilities.</em></strong> The zombie loses all spellcasting abilities or actions with magical effects.<br />
<strong><em>Traits.</em></strong> The zombie loses all traits, but gains Undead Fortitude.<br />
<strong><em>Undead Fortitude (1/Day).</em></strong> If the zombie is reduced to 0 hit points by damage that isn’t radiant or from a critical hit, it is instead reduced to 1 hit point, falls prone, and is stunned until the end of its next turn, appearing to be dead.<br />
<strong><em>Actions.</em></strong> The zombie gains a Bite and Grab attack, both of which use Strength for attack and damage rolls. The escape DC for the zombie’s Grab is equal to its maneuver DC. It loses any ranged attacks that require the use of a weapon more complex than a rock.<br />
<strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 5 ft., one target grappled by a zombie. <em>Hit:</em> 2d4 piercing damage, and the zombie regains the same number of hit points.<br />
<em><strong>Grab.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 1d6 bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled if it’s Medium or smaller, and until the grapple ends the zombie can’t grab another target.</p>
<h2>Memory Leaf</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
Precious beyond reckoning, this silver leaf has fallen from a Memory Tree and contains a psychic imprint of the living creature it was once connected to. It can only be attuned when pressed against the forehead and is often set into a woven headband.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Memory Leaf</em>, which fell from a Memory Tree in ages past.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> Sometimes those who wear the leaf sense those who have worn it before.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The leaf can grant knowledge about the ancient world.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Memory Leaf</em> has one lesser artifact benefit. There is a 50% chance when you attune to the leaf that you discover a lesser artifact detriment.<br />
In some cases the benefit and detriment are reflections of the former personality, and you may acquire those traits while attuned to it.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>While this leaf is pressed against your forehead, you can cast <em>legend lore</em> to ask the psychic imprint within the leaf one question about the ancient world. Once you have used this property 3 times, it cannot be used again until next dawn.</p>
<h3>Orb of Dragonkind</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
Long ago the souls of five evil dragons were ripped from their corporeal bodies and captured with arcana by mages that sought to end the tyranny of wicked winged serpents. Each is contained within an intricately inscribed crystal globe 10 inches across—though when the magic within is called upon, an orb swells to double its size and glows with a faint light revealing the color of the scales that once belonged to what little remains of the creature that now resides in it.<br />
While you are attuned to and holding an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em>, you can use an action and speak a command word to attempt to control the draconic soul within by making a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, you can control the <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em>, or on a failure you are charmed by it. Both effects last until you are no longer attuned to the orb.<br />
While you are charmed by the orb, you cannot choose to end your attunement to it. In addition, the orb can innately cast <em>suggestion</em> on you at will (save DC 18) to compel you to commit evil acts that serve its purposes—exacting revenge, attaining its freedom, spread suffering and ruin, encourage the worship of foul draconic deities, collect the other <em>orbs of dragonkind</em>, or whatever else the Narrator deems fit.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em>, an artifact with the power to control dragons.</p>
<p><strong>DC 20</strong> Five orbs were made, each containing the soul of an evil dragon.</p>
<p><strong>DC 25</strong> The orb can summon evil dragons, but does not actually control them.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>While you are controlling an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em>, you can use an action to cast <em>detect magic</em> at will. You can also expend 1 or more charges to cast <em>detect magic</em> (no charge), <em>daylight</em> (1 charge), <em>death ward</em> (2 charges), <em>cure wounds</em> (5th-level version, 3 charges), or <em>scrying</em> (save DC 18; 3 charges).<br />
The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges each dawn.</p>
<h3>Call Dragons</h3>
<p>While you are controlling an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em>, you can use an action to send a telepathic message in a 40-mile radius. Evil dragons that are mortal and in the area are compelled to take the quickest and most direct route to the orb, though they may not be friendly or pleased with being forced to answer the call. Once this property has been used, you cannot use it again for 1 hour.</p>
<h3>Destroying an Orb</h3>
<p>Despite its glass appearance, an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> is immune to most types of damage (including draconic breath weapons and natural attacks), but they can be destroyed by the <em>disintegrate</em> spell or a single strike from a weapon with a +3 magical bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>
<h2>Raiment of the Devouring King</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous items, artifacts (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
Since the destruction of Nyth’Zerogg, the Devouring King, pieces of this mind-bending entity have shown up throughout history, ultimately destroying their bearers and causing untold devastation. The destruction that they have wrought is insignificant compared to the danger that they pose however, as these artifacts hold the key to restoring the spore of Nyth’Zerogg so that he may consume all reality.<br />
The <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em> consists of three pieces: a cloak, a crown, and an orb. To attune to a piece, you must awaken it by pouring the blood of a recently sacrificed sapient creature onto it, allowing you to graft it to your body in a process that takes a minute, during which you are incapacitated by agony. Once attuned, pieces can only be removed if you are killed.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is part of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em>, the remains of an ancient being who consumed worlds.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> There are three surviving pieces of the raiment: a cloak, a crown, and an orb.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The cloak grants flight and teleportation, the crown transforms the wearer’s body, and the orb enhances their mind.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>While you are attuned to any piece of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em>, you are subject to Malignant Influence (see below) and gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cease aging and become immune to poison and disease.  </li>
<li>You gain a pool of 8 charges that can be spent to fuel the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em>’s magical properties (save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). You regain 1d4 + 1 charges each dusk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Complete Set</h3>
<p>Because of their powerful desire to be together, no matter how many pieces of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em> you wear they count as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement. For each additional piece of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em> that you acquire, you gain the following benefits:<br />
<strong><em>Two Pieces.</em></strong> Your pool of charges increases to 12. You can use an action to regain 1 expended charge by messily devouring an incapacitated or unconscious creature within your reach, killing it in the process. Creatures slain in this manner can only be returned to life by means of a <em>wish</em> or <em>true resurrection</em>.<br />
<strong><em>Three Pieces.</em></strong> Your pool of charges increases to 16. When you take a short rest, you can extend tendrils into the ground and regain 1d4 + 1 charges by consuming natural energy within a 1-mile radius. All plant life in the area dies and beasts become poisoned while in the area. This property can only be used in an area once per decade, after which it cannot support life for the next 10 years.<br />
You cannot be permanently killed unless each piece of the raiment is cut from your body in conjunction with a carefully worded <em>wish</em> spell. Instead, you return to life 1d3 days later.</p>
<h3>Cloak of the Devouring King</h3>
<p>This deep jade cloak resembles a large piece of torn wing membrane. When attuned, it grafts to your back, reweaving muscle and bone and turning into a single leathery wing that grants a portion of Nyth’zerogg’s vitality.<br />
While attuned to the <em>Cloak of the Devouring King</em>, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Constitution score is increased to 20. This property has no effect if your Constitution is equal to or greater than 20.  </li>
<li>You gain a fly speed equal to your Speed.  </li>
<li>You regain 1d8 hit points at the beginning of each of your turns if you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, you regrow the missing part within 1d6 days.  </li>
<li>You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: <em>longstrider</em> (1 charge), <em>misty step</em> (2 charges), <em>blink</em> (3 charges), <em>dimension door</em> (4 charges), <em>plane shift</em> (5 charges), or <em>teleport</em> (5 charges)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crown of the Devouring King</h3>
<p>The alabaster crown resembles a jagged piece of flat bone affixed to a crude iron band. When worn, it settles so that a single spoke of bone extends above the wearer’s eye. When you attune to the skull, it grafts with your bone and grants a portion of Nyth’zerogg’s strength.<br />
While attuned to the <em>Crown of the Devouring King,</em> you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Strength score is increased to 20. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.  </li>
<li>Your body transforms, turning a rubbery gray green as chitinous bone plates emerge from your skin. This counts as a suit of <em>+1 leather</em> if you are proficient with light armor, a suit of <em>+1 breastplate</em> if you are proficient with medium armor, or a suit of <em>+1 full plate</em> if you are proficient with heavy armor. This armor does not impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.  </li>
<li>You can use an action to spend 1 charge to shape chitin and bone from your body into a <em>+1 weapon</em>. You may only have two such weapons in existence at a time. Any ammunition needed is created as the weapon is fired. You may spend 1 charge as part of an action to deliver touch spells through a weapon created in this manner by making a single weapon attack as a part of that action. A weapon created in this manner crumbles to dust a round after it leaves your person.  </li>
<li>You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: <em>shield</em> (1 charge), <em>enlarge/reduce</em> (2 charges), <em>protection from energy</em> (self only; 2 charges), <em>stoneskin</em> (self only; 3 charges).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Orb of the Devouring King</h3>
<p>This crimson orb resembles a massive, calcified heart suspended on a crude chain. When the orb returns to life, hooked tendrils extend and burrow into your chest, lodging it there where it grants a portion of the god’s mind and knowledge.<br />
While attuned to the <em>Orb of the Devouring King</em>, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose Intelligence or Charisma. The chosen ability score is increased to 20. This property has no effect if the chosen ability score is equal to or greater than 20.  </li>
<li>You gain a 1d10 expertise die on Intelligence checks.  </li>
<li>When you take a short rest, you can recover an expended spell slot of 6th-level or higher by spending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot recovered.  </li>
<li>You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: <em>detect thoughts</em> (1 charge), <em>suggestion</em> (2 charges), <em>black tentacles</em> (3 charges), <em>telekinesis</em> (4 charges), <em>dominate monster</em> (5 charges).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Malignant Influence</h3>
<p>Each piece of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em> longs to be united with the others so that Nyth’Zerogg may live again. While attuned to a piece of the artifact, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw once per month or gain a level of Malignant Influence, which cannot be removed while you are attuned to the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em>. With two pieces of the artifact attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per week, and when all three pieces of the artifact are attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per day.<br />
<strong><em>Level 1.</em></strong> You become obsessed with acquiring the other pieces of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em> and devote all of the time and resources at your disposal to the task.<br />
<strong><em>Level 2.</em></strong> You become ravenous and must consume one living sapient being each day or gain a level of fatigue that persists until you consume such a creature.<br />
<strong><em>Level 3.</em></strong> You fall entirely under the sway of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em>. You gain the Chaotic and Evil alignment traits, and you will stop at nothing to see Nyth’Zerogg reborn. You become an NPC under the Narrator’s control.</p>
<h3>Awakening Nyth’Zerogg</h3>
<p>If all three pieces of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em> graft to a single host and they acquire three levels of Malignant Influence, the host’s mind and soul are devoured as fuel for Nyth’zerogg’s reawakening. The exact consequences of such a reawakening are left to the Narrator but likely pose an extinction level threat to mortals and gods alike.</p>
<h3>Destruction</h3>
<p>Many attempts have been made to destroy pieces of the <em>Raiment of the Devouring King</em>, yet they always reform. Some believe that they can only be destroyed by plunging a creature with all three pieces of the artifact grafted to its body into the heart of a star or a true flame in the center of the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>
<h2>Serveros War Engine</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
In size and shape this massive construct is not unlike a squat hill giant—if hill giants were made of metal, leather, wood, and glass. With all manner of wheels, gears, cables, and hinges, when worn its movements are surprisingly fluid, if somewhat loud and heavy.<br />
The last of its kind, the <em>Serveros War Engine</em> was used by a forgotten empire’s soldiers in wars that spread far beyond their kingdom. It’s hard to imagine there may once have been entire armies outfitted with these magical constructs and engaged in battle against one another, and impossible to conceive of the untold destruction they wrought.<br />
Mounting the war engine is a fairly straightforward matter. As you enter the construct, you can don a helm and belt, both connected to the war engine, which allow you to attune to and control the construct. The construct is not sentient and moves only when controlled in this way.<br />
When controlling the construct, you form a psychic bond with it, seeing through its eyes, moving with its limbs, and experiencing pain through its body.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Serveros War Engine</em>, the last war machine of a forgotten empire.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The engine is piloted from inside, and only those with mental and physical fortitude can endure it. In addition to offering great might, it can manifest arcane blades, cannons, and other effects.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> Destroying the engine requires destroying the helm, which is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Serveros War Engine</em> has one lesser artifact benefit. Piloting the war engine can be quite taxing, both mentally and physically. You gain no benefits from a long or short rest while mounted in the war engine, and when you expend its last available charge you suffer both a level of fatigue and strife.<br />
While you are attuned to, mounted inside, and controlling the <em>Serveros War Engine</em>, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your AC becomes 18.  </li>
<li>Your Strength score becomes 21.  </li>
<li>You are Huge-sized.  </li>
<li>Your Speed becomes 40 feet.  </li>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid being grappled or knocked prone.  </li>
<li>You sustain only 1 hit point of damage for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt to you.  </li>
<li>Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage.  </li>
<li>Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.  </li>
<li>You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.  </li>
<li>You are vulnerable to psychic damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Charged Properties</h3>
<p>The war engine has several built-in features, some of which are powered by stored electrical charges or life energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>A sword hilt is secured to the construct’s hip by an incredible magnetic force. As a bonus action you can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to draw the hilt and engage its plasma blade.<br />
<em><strong>Plasma Blade.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two hands.  </li>
<li>An arcane cannon is housed in the construct’s left forearm. You can use an action or bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the arcane cannon.<br />
<em><strong>Arcane Cannon.</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> range 120/300 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d6) radiant damage.  </li>
<li>You can use an action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the construct’s right gauntlet as a projectile.<br />
<em><strong>Gauntlet Grapple.</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> range 60/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is grappled. As a bonus action you can retract the hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target moves with the hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Serveros War Engine</em> begins with 1d20 charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check, 2d10 charges can be restored during a long rest.</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>The Narrator may apply one or more of the following variant options if desired.<br />
<strong>Airborne.</strong> You can expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to unfold magical wings and gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute.<br />
<strong>Disrepair.</strong> When first discovered, the <em>Serveros War Engine</em> may be completely depleted of stored charges and heavily damaged, or perhaps almost completely dismantled. With maintenance, care, and careful reconstruction using Engineering (or a <em>wish</em> spell), it can be restored to its full, terrible power.<br />
<strong>Glass Jaw.</strong> When the <em>Serveros War Engine</em> takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, roll a d20. On a 1, the war engine’s head is knocked off, disabling the artifact until it is repaired with a DC 23 Intelligence (Engineering) check and 8 hours of work.<br />
<strong>Mortal Echoes.</strong> The <em>Serveros War Engine’s</em> last pilot died while mounted within the war engine, and echoes of their psyche still linger within the construct. When first attempting to attune to the artifact, you relive the final moments of the dead pilot and make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and gain a short-term mental stress effect.<br />
<strong>Nautical.</strong> You gain a swim speed of 40 feet. In addition, you can use an action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to seal the cockpit and fill it with breathable air which lasts for 1 hour.<br />
<strong>Recon.</strong> You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet and can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to activate magical floating discs on the soles of the construct’s feet. The discs last for 1 hour during which time the construct does not cause you to have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and you leave no tracks on the ground.<br />
<strong>Serveros Slayer.</strong> In lieu of the arcane cannon and detachable fist, the construct is equipped with a psyblade in each hand. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to deploy one or both psyblades.<br />
<strong><em>Psyblade.</em><em> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (3d6+5) psychic damage.<br />
</strong>Specialized Weaponry.<strong> Instead of a giant plasma sword, the <em>Serveros War Engine* has one of the following weapons. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to equip and activate the weapon.<br />
</em></strong>Discus Throwing Shield.<strong> Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:<em> reach 5 ft. or range 40/80 ft., one target, or if thrown two targets within 10 feet of each other. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage.<br />
In addition, while the shield is donned your AC increases by 2.<br />
</em></strong>Extendable Metal Staff.<strong> Melee Weapon Attack:<em> reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning, or 18 (3d8+5) bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands, and a Large or smaller target makes a DC 18 Strength saving throw or is knocked prone.<br />
</em></strong>Shocking Net.<strong> Ranged Weapon Attack:<em> range 30/60 ft., all targets in a 15-foot square area. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d8) lightning damage and the target is grappled. At the start of your turn, conscious creatures grappled by the net take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. This weapon cannot damage a creature with 0 hit points.<br />
</em></strong>Sonic War Hammer.<em><em> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> reach 10 ft., one target. </em>Hit:* 18 (3d8+5) thunder damage, or 21 (3d10+5) thunder damage when wielded with two hands.</p>
<h3>Destroying the War Engine</h3>
<p>Of all its various parts and components the key to disabling and ultimately destroying the war engine is the helm. The rest of the massive construct might feasibly be replaced or reengineered by an ingenious mind. However with its complex structure, both magical and mechanical, replicating the controller headpiece requires arcane knowledge and technical documentation that disappeared with the war engine’s creators long ago.<br />
The helm is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm. Bypassing its magical protections requires two steps: first, a <em>dispel magic</em> cast at 5th-level or higher is needed to make the invisible barrier around the war engine’s helm vulnerable for 6 seconds, followed by a <em>disintegrate</em> spell cast at 7th-level or higher to completely dissolve the barrier. Once the barrier is dissolved, for the next 24 hours the helm can be destroyed like any other item (AC 22, 100 hit points) before its magical protections regenerate and fully repair it.</p>
<h2>Sword of Three Traditions</h2>
<p><em>Weapon (varies), artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
The <em>Sword of Three Traditions</em> is a jewel-pommeled blade with the power to transform into other weapons—each specially suited for one of the eleven martial traditions. Originally called the <em>Sword of All Traditions</em>, over time the gems in the pommel were lost and now only three remain. Should its lost gemstones be returned, the blade might be restored to its full spectrum of glory and power.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Sword of Three Traditions</em>, which grants mastery of the techniques of combat. Each of the three gemstones in its hilt represents a tradition of combat.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The sword can transform into other weapons based on the gemstones in its hilt.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> Only a dragon of the same color can destroy the sword’s gemstones.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Sword of Three Traditions</em> has two lesser artifact benefits, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. For each of the first five magical gemstones restored to the sword, it gains 1 lesser artifact benefit. For each of the last three magical gemstones restored to it, the sword gains 1 greater artifact detriment and 1 greater artifact benefit.<br />
The <em>Sword of Three Traditions</em> is a <em>+1 longsword</em>. Once you are attuned, you can use an action to turn the sword into a different <em>+1 weapon</em>. In addition, when you use a combat maneuver, the sword automatically changes into the weapon associated with that tradition. To change into a given weapon, the gem associated with that tradition must be attached.<br />
While holding the sword, when you use a combat maneuver of a tradition associated with an attached gem, its exertion cost is reduced by 1 (minimum 1 exertion).</p>

<h3>Magical Gemstones</h3>
<p>Each of the lost magical gemstones of the <em>Sword of Three Traditions</em> is a wondrous item and artifact that requires attunement. Once attuned to a magical gemstone, it bestows a minor artifact benefit. You can only attune to the magical gemstone if you know a combat maneuver from the tradition associated with it.<br />
You can use an action to attach a magical gemstone to the sword. No matter how many magical gemstones are attached to the sword, it counts as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement.<br />
The sword normally comes affixed with its diamond, peridot, and sapphire (for the Adamant Mountain, Rapid Current, and Razor’s Edge traditions), but the Narrator may choose to have different magical gemstones attached to it or determine them randomly.<br />
When the sword turns into more than one item, the +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls only apply to any weapons created (there are no bonuses bestowed to the ammunition or shield). The additional objects materialize either in the attuned creature’s off-hand or strapped to their back. Any such item created by the sword disappears after 1 minute if it is no longer on your person, or when the sword changes shape again.<br />
The sword’s power increases when 7 gems are in its pommel (turning it into a <em>+2 weapon</em> that reduces exertion costs by 2) or when fully restored with all 11 magical gemstones (turning it into a <em>+3 weapon</em> that reduces exertion costs by 3).</p>
<h3>Seekers of the Sword</h3>
<p>The <em>Sword of Three Traditions</em> is sought after by power hungry and righteous warriors alike, and any search for the fabled blade is certain to cause conflict with some of the following foes.</p>

<h3>Destroying the Sword</h3>
<p>The power which binds the <em>Sword of Three Traditions</em> is located in its magical gemstones. Each gemstone can be destroyed forever if it is removed from the pommel and fed to an adult or older true dragon of similar hue. Once each magical gemstone is destroyed, the blade crumbles into dust.</p>
<h2>The Song of Creation</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item (prayer book), artifact (requires attunement by a divine spellcaster)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
This golden tome is a written record of the divine dance which brought the world into being. </p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Song of Creation</em>, a prayer book filled with the eternal melody which brought the world into being.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The tome can break the minds of those who read it, but it can also grant access to powerful miracles.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The tome is completely indestructible.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Song of Creation</em> has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.</p>
<h3>Mystical Tome</h3>
<p>This tome is written in a script that even the angels cannot decipher. While attuned to it, you can read it as though you are reading your first language. Reading the <em>Song of Creation</em> reveals beautiful poetry about nature, light, and life, but structurally they do not make sense when read start-to-end. The poems cannot be perfectly translated, as each individual interprets the same poem differently. The pages cannot be counted, and various purported complete counts invariably disagree.<br />
When you first attune to this tome and when you read it, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or else become stunned for 1 hour. If you succeed on this saving throw, you are not subject to it again for 1 week. If you consult this tome during a Wisdom or Intelligence check to recall lore, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll, and any natural d20 results of 2 through 9 count as a 10.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>While you use this prayer book as a spell focus, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC, and you cast the spell without the need for any other material components that cost 1,000 gold or less. In addition, you know the following spells: <em>astral projection, demiplane, gate, maze, true resurrection</em>.</p>
<h3>Destroying the Song</h3>
<p>The <em>Song of Creation</em> is made from a material that defies categorization, and it may well be indestructible. The best hope at banishing its power from the world is to return the tome directly into the hands of a god.</p>
<h2>Veil of Fate</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
The <em>Veil of Fate</em> is a diaphanous silver and gray cloth attached to a thin silvery band which is worn on the bearer’s head. When worn correctly, it falls to the floor around its bearer, covering them entirely in a faint silver shimmer. It is unknown whether or not this appearance is due purely to the physical nature of the veil or its powers taking the bearer slightly beyond the bounds of reality.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Veil of Fate</em>, which allows the wearer to see the very strands of destiny.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The veil grants glimpses into the future.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> Many who have donned the veil are immediately struck by disturbingly accurate premonitions of the future.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Veil of Fate</em> has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment.<br />
When you are wearing and attuned to the veil, creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you as the combination of your enhanced foresight and diaphanous appearance bamboozles your foes.<br />
The glimpses of the future granted by the <em>Veil of Fate</em> are not always advantageous. You are always last in the initiative order as you are overwhelmed with insights into the events that are about to unfold, though you may choose to use your foretelling roll (see Control Fate below) for all of your initiative checks for the day.<br />
In addition, you can impart some of the veil’s power by falling into a deep meditation for 8 hours. When your meditation is concluded, your touch bestows one of the benefits of the <em>Veil of Fate</em> onto an allied creature, and you suffer a level of fatigue from the effort.</p>
<h3>Foretelling</h3>
<p>At the Narrator’s discretion, when you first attune to the <em>Veil of Fate</em> you are granted a detailed premonition of future events, presenting the opportunity to intertwine those threads of fate with your own. You can perfectly recall the premonition for a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 day), after which the memory is gone as if you never experienced it. Anything you write down or otherwise record about the premonition during this time is all that remains. Another creature may be given a different premonition or no premonition upon attuning to the veil. You can occasionally recall key details of the premonition at important crossroads in the future before the depicted events occur, and otherwise receive guidance from the premonition long after you’ve forgotten it.</p>
<h3>Choose Your Destiny</h3>
<p>While attuned to the <em>Veil of Fate</em> you are keenly aware of your own destiny.<br />
When you spend 8 hours meditating on your destiny and life’s purpose, you can see some of the steps you must take to change it. This meditation brings on a profound change, and when it is concluded you may choose a new Destiny.</p>
<h3>Control Fate</h3>
<p>When you finish a long rest, you are bolstered by a strange sense of how to get the most out of your interactions and endeavours, gaining inspiration.<br />
In addition, after completing a long rest you roll a d20. This is your foretelling roll. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you may choose to replace the d20 roll with your foretelling roll. You may choose to use this property after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the roll’s effects occur. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>You may cast <em>augury</em> at will while attuned to and wearing th<em>e Veil of Fate</em>.<br />
Twice per long rest you can cast one of the following spells without consuming material components or expending a spell slot: <em>arcane eye, clairvoyance, commune, divination.</em><br />
Roll a d20 after each long rest. On an 18 or above, you gain the benefits of the <em>foresight</em> spell.</p>
<h2>Walking Chicken Hut</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
Rumored to appear in bogs and swamps where amidst the fog it is often mistaken for a gigantic predatory bird, this ramshackle hut has been known to convey many an influential spellcaster. Arcane societies tend to look down upon the people that deign to use this artifact and refuse to recognize it for what it truly is, perpetuating the belief that it is a cursed relic best left alone. Any knowledgeable scholar knows there is good reason for the practice—sometimes when left idle for too long without a master the hut walks of its own accord directly towards the nearest planar portal, and all those known to have claimed ownership have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.<br />
A simple bed and table permanently affixed to the floor in this shuttered wooden hut, and it is able to fit up to 12 Medium or smaller creatures inside. After taking a long rest inside of the hut, you make a DC 21 Perception check, seeing through the veil and revealing its true nature on a success—strange markings and other signs of witchcraft cover nearly every surface of the interior and it reeks of chicken effluent. Once the veil is seen through, there are 8 glowing runes on the table, each only half-illuminated. When you pass your hand over a rune, the energies inside respond and you can fully illuminate it or remove its glow entirely. When certain runes are illuminated, enormous chicken legs beneath the hut rise it up off of the ground. The <em>Chicken Hut</em> is a Gargantuan object with an Armor Class of 21, a total of 320 hit points, Speed 50 ft. or swim 10 ft. (0 ft. if the legs aren’t extended), and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.<br />
The hut floats on water. While the hut’s door and window shutters are closed, the interior is airtight and watertight. The interior holds enough air for 60 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.<br />
You can use an action to control the illumination of as many as two of the hut’s runes, and a bonus action to control a third. After each use, a rune goes back to its neutral position. Each rune, from left to right, functions as shown in the Walking Chicken Hut Runes table.<br />
If you are not attuned to any magic items and spend a week inside of the <em>Walking Chicken Hut</em>, you can attune to it. The hut uses 2 of your attunement slots. Once attuned, as long as you can see it you can use your bonus action to manipulate as many as 3 of its runes.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Walking Chicken Hut</em>, home to many wielders of magic throughout the ages.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The hut is known to move and act of its own accord.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The hut can be controlled using the runes on the table within.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>The <em>Walking Chicken Hut</em> has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.</p>

<h2>Whispering Stones</h2>
<p><em>Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)</em><br />
<strong>Crafting Components:</strong> Unique (uncraftable)<br />
Just as a fortune teller’s scrying ball is crystal clear, <em>Whispering Stones</em> are orbs of inky blackness.They allow communication across long distances. However, these potent artifacts are imbued with material from the netherworld and only five are known to have been created.<br />
Connected via the realm of the dead, with proper use a person can communicate simultaneously with any number of other <em>Whispering Stones</em> and <em>message stones</em>, or even stream thoughts from places and beings beyond death.</p>
<h3>Legends and Lore</h3>
<p>Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is a <em>Whispering Stone</em>, which allows communication across long distances. Only five of these stones were ever created.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The stones can speak to each other.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The stones can also speak to the dead, or ask questions of powerful extraplanar beings.</p>
<h3>Artifact Properties</h3>
<p>Each time you use a <em>Whispering Stone</em> to cast a spell, roll a d20. On a 1, the casting connects your mind with that of an extradimensional entity chosen by the Narrator. You begin to hear this entity’s thoughts in your head (and vice versa), and if you were not already attuned to the <em>Whispering Stone</em>, you immediately attune to it. In addition, you gain one short-term mental stress effect that lasts for 1d6 days. The voice in your head remains for as long as the mental stress effect.<br />
If you simultaneously connect to two or more extradimensional entities, you make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term mental stress effect.</p>

<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>While touching a <em>Whispering Stone</em> you can use an action to cast <em>sending</em>. The target is a creature that carries a <em>message stone</em> or <em>Whispering Stone</em> you have seen before. If no creature currently bears that stone, or if you have never seen a <em>message stone</em> or <em>Whispering Stone</em> before, your message is conveyed to another recipient. The Narrator may select a specific creature to receive the message or consult the Whispering Stones Listener table. This recipient of your message learns your name, current location, and that you bear a <em>Whispering Stone</em>.<br />
A <em>Whispering Stone</em> begins with 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges each dusk. While attuned to the stone, you can use an action to cast <em>speak with dead</em> (1 charge) and <em>spirit guardians</em> (1 charge). If also connected to an extra dimensional entity, you can cast <em>divination</em> (once between long rests) to ask the entity a question.</p>
<h1>Crafting Magic Items</h1>
<p>For those who have reached the height of mundane crafting there is the intricate practice of creating magical items. This can be done during downtime, like crafting mundane items, but is often a more finicky process. Magic items can be as unique as their crafters, ranging from potions to armor sets, and a particular magic item can look different every time someone new crafts it.<br />
Unlike crafting mundane items, crafting magic items is rather hit or miss. Crafting a magic item is either successful or it is not.<br />
<strong>Player Level.</strong> Common magic items are called such for a reason—just about anyone can create them. As the rarity of an item increases however, so does the level of skill required. The Minimum Player Level table shows what level a character must reach before being able to craft magic items of a certain rarity. Unless their statistics state otherwise, an NPC is only able to craft magic items if they have spellcasting levels.<br />
<strong>Base Materials.</strong> To craft a magic item a character must first acquire base materials equal to half the magic item’s cost; this includes special metals, wood, leather, and other substances which make the basic item, plus a mixture of common alchemical reagents, arcane components, or divine ingredients. These materials can be purchased easily as long as the character has the requisite funds and usually do not need to be accounted for individually.<br />
<strong>Special Components.</strong> For most magic items, specific additional components are also needed that may not be available for purchase. PCs may need to undertake adventures in order to acquire these components. See the description of the desired magic item to learn what, if any, special items are needed. Special components include exotic items (such as a mirror that a basilisk has seen its reflection in), or creature parts (such as dragon scales). Creature parts can be easily collected from a defeated monster with no special ability checks required; this takes one hour and gives one dose plus one dose per size category of the creature above Medium. Collecting creature parts from any unwilling sentient humanoid is considered an evil act.<br />
Special components generally can’t be bought or sold (the market for them is just too niche), but Narrators may decide that instead of questing for the special components to create a magic item that they can be purchased for 25% of the magic item’s cost.<br />
<strong>Item Quality.</strong> Common magic items can be made from items of any quality, but uncommon magic items require an item of fine quality, and rare or greater magic items require an item of masterwork quality. Costs for an item’s quality are included in a magic item’s base cost.<br />
<strong>Time Required<em>.</em></strong> The time required to craft a magic item depends on its rarity, as shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time table. To craft a magic item, a character must make multiple ability checks due to the difficult nature of magic item crafting: an initial check and a final check.<br />
<strong>Initial Check.</strong> At the beginning of the required time, the character makes an ability check against the DC for an item of that rarity. On a success, they can continue crafting the item as normal. On a failure, they have to start over. On a failure by 5 or more, crafting can continue but the final check’s DC increases by 2. Failing this check by 10 or more consumes half the required materials and is considered a failed attempt; however you gain one expertise die that you can use the next time you attempt to craft the same item, as long as it has been no longer than a month.<br />
<strong>Final Check.</strong> At the end of the required crafting time, the character makes another ability check to complete their magic item against the DC for an item of that rarity. On a success, all the materials are consumed and they make the desired magic time. On a failure, the process consumes half of the required materials and the crafting fails. On a failure by 10 or more, all the materials are consumed and the crafting fails.<br />
<strong>Ability Checks.</strong> Different types of items, and different rarities, require different ability checks to successfully craft. The Magic Item Crafting Abilities table shows what ability checks are required to craft items of that type. Some magic items may fit in multiple categories, such as an amulet crafted from wood or suits of armor that also allow a character to cast spells. In these cases, which type the item falls under is determined by the Narrator.<br />
<strong>Tool Requirements.</strong> Crafting anything requires the right tools for the job—this is especially important when crafting magical items. Each type of magic item and the tools associated with those types are detailed on the General Magic Item Crafting table. A character does not require proficiency with the tools needed to make a magic item, only access to those tools.<br />
At the Narrator’s discretion, enough time spent crafting a specific type of magic item may grant a character proficiency with the required tools. This should only be done after a character has successfully crafted multiple magic items, or after they have created an item of very rare rarity or higher.</p>

<h2>Creating New Magic Items</h2>
<p>Each campaign is different—every magic item may not be the best fit for a game, or the Narrator may need something that no one has thought of yet. In these instances, use the rules below to guide the process of coming up with new magic items and the ways a character might craft them.</p>
<h3>Determining Rarity</h3>
<p>Determining the rarity of a new magic item is one of the most difficult parts. While there’s no set formula for determining rarity, refer to the following points when choosing the rarity of a new magic item;</p>
<ul>
<li>An item with one low power property that is consumed upon use is most likely common or uncommon, depending on the property. If the property recharges, it may still be common if the effect has little mechanical impact.   </li>
<li>An item with multiple low to mid-level power properties, or a single lower power property which recharges, is likely uncommon or rare.   </li>
<li>If an item has multiple powerful properties that recharge, or one significantly powerful property that recharges, it is most likely rare or very rare.   </li>
<li>If the item is powerful enough to be game-changing, or is especially powerful and one of a kind, it is likely legendary or even an artifact.   </li>
<li>If the item grants a creature the ability to cast spells, or replicates the effects of a spell, what level is that spell? The higher the spell level, the higher the item’s rarity.   </li>
<li>Finally, consider the item’s purpose. Items that are less about making whoever carries them more effective, and more about granting access to something important for roleplaying purposes—such as defenses against a harsh environment, a way to overcome multiple language barriers, or survive somewhere without air—may have their rarity reduced. Conversely, items that allow for an adventurer or their party to easily complete dangerous tasks (particularly those granting flight) may have a higher rarity than usual.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining Cost</h3>
<p>In most cases when including a new magic item for crafting or purchase it will be necessary to set a price for it. The Magic Item Costs table contains guidelines for pricing new magic items. Rarity isn’t the only thing to consider, however—for example, a magic item that is consumed on use is almost always cheaper than one of the same rarity that recharges. The following list contains a few things that may help determine the price of a new item.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it single use, multiple uses, or does it recharge indefinitely? Single use items should be cheaper than multiple use items, which are themselves typically cheaper than something that recharges regularly.  </li>
<li>How does it compare to other items of the same rarity? If another item is of a similar power level, use that item’s cost as a starting point.  </li>
<li>Does it have one property or multiple properties, and how many uses does each of the item’s properties have? Something with multiple rechargeable properties is going to be more expensive than one with multiple single use properties, or even one recharging property.  </li>
<li>Does the item grant a creature the ability to cast spells, or replicate the effects of a spell? If so, what level is that spell? The higher the spell level, the higher the potential cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will always be outliers. The Magic Item Costs table does not take these outliers into account, and instead provides both an average low cost and average high cost for magic items that only require the standard components to create.</p>
