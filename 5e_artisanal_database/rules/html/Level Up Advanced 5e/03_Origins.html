<h1>Origins</h1>
<h1>Heritage</h1>
<p>The first step in the origin creation process is deciding on a heritage such as a dwarf, elf, or halfling.</p>
<h2>Age</h2>
<p>This section details the average age at which a character of this heritage is considered to have reached adulthood, as well as their typical life span.</p>
<h2>Size</h2>
<p>All creatures are assigned a size, ranging from Tiny to Gargantuan. Medium and Small are the most common sizes for adventurers.</p>
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>Each heritage has a base Speed. This determines how far you can move on your turn during combat and while traveling.</p>
<h2>Darkvision</h2>
<p>Creatures with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, out to a certain distance.</p>
<h2>Heritage Gift</h2>
<p>In addition to the traits granted to all characters of the same heritage, some include multiple gifts for you to choose from. When multiple options are presented, you may choose only one heritage gift.</p>
<h2>Paragon Gift</h2>
<p>Later in an adventuring career, each heritage grants a paragon feature. </p>
<h1>Dragonborn</h1>

Additionally, choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone for the area that your breath weapon affects. Each creature in the breath’s area makes a Dexterity saving throw. If your breath weapon deals psychic damage, a Wisdom saving throw is made instead of Dexterity; if cold, necrotic, poison, radiant, or thunder, a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.<br />
A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw, or half damage on a success. The damage increases to 3d6 at 4th level, 4d6 at 9th level, 5d6 at 14th level, and 6d6 at 19th level.<br />

<h1>Backgrounds</h1>
<p>The next step in creating your character’s origin story is choosing their background. A character’s background tells a story about the life they have chosen to lead, separate from the culture they were raised in.</p>
<h2>Ability Score Increase</h2>
<p>Each background increases one of a character’s ability scores by 1 and allows you to increase a second ability score of your choice. </p>
<h2>Proficiencies</h2>
<p>Most backgrounds grant proficiency with two or more skills and tool sets. <br />
If your character gains a skill proficiency they already have, they instead gain another skill proficiency of their choice. If they gain a tool proficiency they already have, they instead gain a different tool proficiency.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>Like cultures, your background can also allow your character to learn additional languages.</p>
<h2>Connections</h2>
<p>Each background provides examples of one acquaintance, ally, or enemy that has had an effect on your character’s life.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>Suggested equipment sets are included with each background, along with an associated gold cost.</p>
<h2>Memento</h2>
<p>Each background includes options for a memento. This is a sentimental item reflective of your background and the occurrences that have built you into who you are, typically worth less than 30 gold.</p>
<h2>Background Feature</h2>
<p>Every background comes with a feature that helps determine how your character interacts with the world and people around them.</p>

<h1>Destinies</h1>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The Narrator awards inspiration, a resource which grants you an edge in important moments, when you roleplay your character according to your destiny. Each destiny has a source of inspiration which describes acts of roleplaying that should be rewarded with inspiration, although it remains at the Narrator’s discretion. Additionally, the Narrator can award inspiration whenever they feel a character has been particularly clever, engaging, or heartfelt in their roleplaying.<br />
Once you have inspiration, you can save it indefinitely. Whenever you or an ally you can see makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you may spend your inspiration to grant advantage to that roll.<br />
Alternatively, you can spend inspiration to use the inspiration feature unique to your chosen destiny.<br />
You either have inspiration or you don’t; if you already have inspiration and do something worth rewarding inspiration, you do not gain a second use of inspiration.</p>
<h2>Fulfilling Your Destiny</h2>
<p>Each destiny includes a fulfillment feature that you gain when you achieve your destiny, a momentous event usually at the end of a major story arc in the narrative, indicated by the Narrator. Even if your destiny remains outside of your grasp, it is close enough at hand that you automatically gain its fulfillment feature when you reach 16th level.<br />
If you fulfill your destiny early in a campaign, at the Narrator’s discretion you may select an additional destiny. You retain your original destiny’s features and gain the source of inspiration and inspiration feature of your new destiny. You cannot gain a second fulfillment feature.</p>
<h2>Changing Your Destiny</h2>
<p>Whenever you gain a class level, you may choose to change your destiny. You lose any features provided by your current destiny and select a new destiny, gaining its source of inspiration and inspiration features.</p>
<h1>Chaos</h1>
<p><strong>Source of Inspiration: Chaos.</strong> You gain inspiration whenever you successfully subvert law and order, so long as it benefits your allies or moves the story forward.<br />

You have no control over a creature you connect with in this way but you gain an expertise die on checks made to influence it. A creature’s available information is often limited by their own awareness, but most will at least have information regarding events that transpired in the immediate area during the last 24 hours, and nearby prominent creatures or locations.<br />
