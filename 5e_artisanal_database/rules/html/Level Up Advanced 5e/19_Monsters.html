</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The aboleth can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The aboleths spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components: 3/day each: detect thoughts (range 120 ft, desc: ), project image (range 1 mile), phantasmal force</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The aboleth attacks three times with its tentacle.</li>
<li><strong>Tentacle:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The aboleth can choose instead to deal 0 damage. If the target is a creature  it makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  it contracts a disease called the Sea Change. On a success  it is immune to this disease for 24 hours. While affected by this disease  the target has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws. After 1 hour  the target grows gills  it can breathe water  its skin becomes slimy  and it begins to suffocate if it goes 12 hours without being immersed in water for at least 1 hour. This disease can be removed with a disease-removing spell cast with at least a 4th-level spell slot  and it ends 24 hours after the aboleth dies.</li>
<li><strong>Slimy Cloud (1/Day, While Bloodied):</strong> While underwater  the aboleth exudes a cloud of inky slime in a 30-foot-radius sphere. Each non-aboleth creature in the area when the cloud appears makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  it takes 44 (8d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. The slime extends around corners  and the area is heavily obscured for 1 minute or until a strong current dissipates the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The aboleth can take 2 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Move:</strong> The aboleth moves up to its swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Telepathic Summon:</strong> One creature within 90 feet makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must use its reaction, if available, to move up to its speed toward the aboleth by the most direct route that avoids hazards, not avoiding opportunity attacks. This is a magical charm effect.</li>
<li><strong>Baleful Charm (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The aboleth targets one creature within 60 feet that has contracted Sea Change. The target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it is magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies. The target can repeat this saving throw every 24 hours and when it takes damage from the aboleth or the aboleths allies. While charmed in this way, the target can communicate telepathically with the aboleth over any distance and it follows the aboleths orders.</li>
<li><strong>Soul Drain (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> One creature charmed by the aboleth takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.</li>

As an action, the dragon can psionically observe a creature, object, or location it is familiar with within 100 miles. While observing a subject in this way, the dragon can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, but it is blind and deaf in regard to its physical senses and does not require food or water.

Creatures charmed by the dragon make this saving throw with disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>Concussive Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon psionically unleashes telekinetic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw  taking 60 (11d10) force damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.</li>

<li><strong>Far Thoughts:</strong> The dragon is aware of any creature that uses a psionic ability or communicates telepathically within 100 miles of it. As an action, the dragon can psionically observe a creature, object, or location it is familiar with within 100 miles.

Creatures suffering ongoing psychic damage make this saving throw with disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>Discognitive Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon unleashes psychic energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw  taking 66 (12d10) psychic damage and 22 (4d10) ongoing psychic damage on a failed save or half damage and no ongoing psychic damage on a success.

<li><strong>Foretell:</strong> The dragon psionically catches a glimpse of a fast-approaching moment and plans accordingly. The dragon rolls a d20 and records the number rolled. Until the end of the dragons next turn, the dragon can replace the result of any d20 rolled by it or a creature within 120 feet with the foretold number. Each foretold roll can be used only once.</li>
<li><strong>Psionic Wave (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dragon uses Psionic Wave.</li>
<li><strong>Shatter Mind (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw.

<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cold Mastery:</strong> The dragons movement and vision is not hindered by cold, icy surfaces, snow, wind, or storms. Additionally, the dragon can choose to burrow through snow and ice without leaving a trace.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it sheds some of its scales, which turn to ice. If it has no more uses of this ability, its Armor Class is reduced to 18 until it finishes a long rest.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 18). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:dominate beast, fire shield, animal friendship, sleet storm,  1/day each:control weather, wall of ice</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite attack  it can Spit Ice.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tail:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.</li>
<li><strong>Spit Ice:</strong> The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure  the target takes 22 (4d10) cold damage  and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a success  it takes half damage.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales a 90-foot cone of frost. Each creature in the area makes a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  it takes 66 (19d6) cold damage  and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a success  it takes half damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tail Attack:</strong> When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Roar:</strong> Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack:</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.</li>
<li><strong>Raging Storm (1/Day:</strong> For 1 minute, gusts of sleet emanate from the dragon in a 40-foot-radius sphere, spreading around corners. The area is lightly obscured, the ground is difficult terrain, and nonmagical flames are extinguished. The first time a creature other than the dragon moves on its turn while in the area, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) cold damage and fall prone (or fall if it is flying).</li>

<li><strong>Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level; V, S, M):</strong> A bolt of lightning 5 feet wide and 100 feet long arcs from the archmage. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw  taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Confusion (4th-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):</strong> Each creature within 10 feet of a point the archmage can see within 120 feet makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw  becoming rattled until the end of its next turn on a success. On a failure  a creature is confused for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Cone of Cold (5th-Level; V, S, M):</strong> Frost blasts from the archmage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw  taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Mislead (5th-Level; S, Concentration):</strong> The archmage becomes invisible for 1 hour. At the same time  an illusory copy of the archmage appears in their space. The archmage can use an action to move the copy up to 60 feet and have it speak or gesture. The copy is revealed as an illusion with any physical interaction  as solid objects and creatures pass through it.

<li><strong>Teleport (7th-Level; V):</strong> The archmage teleports to a location they are familiar with on the same plane of existence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counterspell (3rd-Level; S):</strong> When a creature the archmage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the archmage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the archmage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the archmage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.</li>
<li><strong>Shield (1st-Level; V:</strong> When the archmage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.</li>

<li><strong>Archpriests head religious orders and often serve on a monarchs council:</strong> Sometimes an archpriest is the highest-ranking leader in the land, and they are often considered the direct mouthpieces of their gods by those who worship.</li>

If the target makes a successful saving throw or the effect ends, the target is immune to this cambions Fell Charm for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Command:</strong> The cambion gives an order to an ally within 60 feet that can hear it. If the ally has a reaction available, it can use it to follow the cambions order, either taking an action or moving up to its Speed.</li>

<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> If the demilich makes a saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, it takes no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (5/Day):</strong> If the demilich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, one of the five tiny warding gems set on its forehead or teeth shatters.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> A demilich doesnt require air, sustenance, or sleep.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Devour Soul:</strong> The demilich targets one creature within 120 feet  forcing it to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a success  or if all the large soul gems on the demilichs skull are occupied  the creature takes 40 necrotic damage  and the demilich regains the same number of hit points. If the target fails its saving throw and there is at least one unoccupied soul gem on the demilichs skull  the demilich regains 40 hit points  and the target dies instantly. Its soul is trapped in a soul gem on the demilichs skull  visible as a tiny  creature-shaped mote of light. While its soul is trapped  a creature can't be restored to life by any means. A soul that remains in a soul gem for 30 days is destroyed forever. If the demilich is defeated and a soul gem crushed  the creature is restored to life if its body is within 100 miles. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect is immune to it for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>A demilich begins combat with one or two empty soul gems:</strong> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The demilich can take 3 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. The demilich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Cranial Transposition:</strong> The dust surrounding the demilich falls to the ground. The demilich and a nonmagical, unattended skull within 30 teleport, switching places. Until the demilich moves or attacks, it is indistinguishable from a nonmagical skull, and the dust composing the demilichs wraithlike body doesnt reform around it.</li>
<li><strong>Dust Storm (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dust of the demilichs body swirls in a 30-foot radius around the demilich. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. The demilich then moves up to its speed.</li>
<li><strong>Ringing Laugh (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> Each creature within 60 feet that can hear the demilich makes a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is frightened until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Telekinesis:</strong> The demilich targets a Huge or smaller creature or an object weighing up to 1,000 pounds within 60 feet. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw. Otherwise, the demilich moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction, including up. If another creature or object stops the targets movement, both take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. At the end of this movement, the target falls if it is still in the air, taking falling damage as normal.</li>

<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> A dread knight doesnt require air, sustenance, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Unholy Aura:</strong> The dread knight and allies within 30 feet have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magic effects and against features that turn undead. Other creatures of the dread knights choice within 30 feet have disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magic effects.</li>
<li><strong>Legion:</strong> The dread knights sword is a +3 greatsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls when it attacks with its cursed greatsword. A humanoid killed by damage from this sword rises the next dusk as a zombie. While attuned to the sword, the dread knight can use a bonus action to command zombies created in this way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cursed Greatsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage  and the targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Blast (1/Day):</strong> A fiery mote streaks from the dread knights finger to a point within 120 feet and blossoms into a 20-foot-radius sphere of black fire which spreads around corners. Each creature within the area makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw  taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw or half damage on a success. This damage ignores fire resistance and treats immunity to fire damage as fire resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Ice Wall (1/Day):</strong> The dread knight magically creates a wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet. The wall is flat  1 foot thick  and can be up to 50 feet long and 15 feet high. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed. Each 10-foot section has AC 12  30 hit points  vulnerability to fire damage  and immunity to cold  necrotic  poison  and psychic damage.</li>
<li><strong>If the wall enters a creatures space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (creatures choice):</strong> The creature then makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw  taking 49 (14d6) cold damage on a successful save or half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Soul Wrack (1/Day):</strong> A creature within 60 feet makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw  taking 70 (20d6) necrotic damage and falling prone on a failed save or taking half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Summon Fiendish Steed (1/Day):</strong> A fell nightmare or wyvern magically appears in an empty space within 5 feet. The steed follows the dread knights commands and acts on its turn. It may attack on the turn on which it is summoned. It remains until the dread knight dismisses it as an action or it is killed.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it visibly grows older. Its original appearance is restored when it finishes a long rest.</li>
<li><strong>Misty Recovery:</strong> When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this way, it can be destroyed by fire damage, radiant damage, damage from a magical weapon, or a wooden stake driven through the heart, but it is otherwise immune to damage.</li>
<li><strong>Regeneration:</strong> The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasnt taken radiant damage since its last turn.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The vampire can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.</li>
<li><strong>Vampire Weaknesses:</strong> Vampires most common weaknesses are sunlight and running water. When the vampire ends its turn in contact with one of its weaknesses (such as being bathed in sunlight or running water), it takes 20 radiant damage. While in contact with its weakness, it can't use its Regeneration trait or its Mist Form or Shapechange actions.</li>
<li><strong>Resting Place:</strong> Every vampires lair contains a resting place, usually a coffin or sarcophagus, where the vampire must rest for at least an hour each day to recuperate its powers. This resting place is sprinkled with soil from its mortal homeland. If this soil is scattered or is subjected to a bless, hallow, or similar spell, the vampire is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</li>
<li><strong>Blood Frenzy:</strong> While bloodied, the vampire can take 3 legendary actions instead of 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grab (Vampire Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Charm:</strong> The vampire targets a creature within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is charmed by the vampire for 24 hours. While charmed it regards the vampire as a trusted friend and is a willing target for the vampires bite. The target repeats the saving throw each time it takes damage  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targets saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to this vampires Charm for 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target that is grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware of the vampires presence. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the vampire regains this number of hit points. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, it dies and rises the following night as a vampire spawn in the vampires thrall. Before the target first rises as a vampire spawn, a bless, gentle repose, or similar spell cast on the body prevents this transformation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hissing Scuttle (1/Day):</strong> When the vampire takes radiant damage, it moves up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Warding Charm (1/Day):</strong> When a creature the vampire can see targets it with a melee attack but before the attack is made, the vampire uses Charm on that creature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The vampire can take 1 legendary action:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Blood Charm:</strong> The vampire uses Charm. A creature makes its initial saving throw with disadvantage if the vampire has hit it with a bite attack within the last 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Grab:</strong> The vampire makes a grab attack.</li>
<li><strong>Mist Form:</strong> The vampire transforms into a mist or back into its true form. As mist, the vampire has a flying speed of 30, can't speak, can't take actions or manipulate objects, is immune to nonmagical damage from weapons, and has advantage on saving throws and Stealth checks. It can pass through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing but can't pass through water. Anything its carrying transforms with it.</li>
<li><strong>Shapechange:</strong> The vampire transforms into the shape of a Medium or smaller beast or back into its true form. While transformed, it has the beasts size and movement modes. It can't use reactions or legendary actions, and can't speak. Otherwise, it uses the vampires statistics. Anything its carrying transforms with it.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Counterspell (3rd-Level; S):</strong> When a creature the mage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the mage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.</li>
<li><strong>Shield (1st-Level; V:</strong> When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.</li>

<li><strong>Pincer:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it is grappled (escape DC 17). The glabrezu has two pincers  each of which can grapple one target. While grappling a target  a pincer can't attack a different target. If the same creature is grappled by both of the glabrezus pincers  it must escape from each of them separately.</li>
<li><strong>Wish:</strong> Once per 30 days  the glabrezu can cast wish for a mortal  using no material components. Before doing so  it will demand that the mortal commit a terribly evil act or make a painful sacrifice.</li>

<li><strong>Rend:</strong> If grappling the same target with both pincers, the glabrezu rips at the target, ending both grapples and dealing 27 (4d10 + 5) slashing damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it dies and is torn in half.</li>
<li><strong>Darkness:</strong> Magical darkness spreads from a point within 30 feet, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere and spreading around corners. It remains for 1 minute, until the glabrezu dismisses it, or until the glabrezu uses this ability again. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.</li>
<li><strong>Confusion (1/Day):</strong> The glabrezu targets up to three creatures within 90 feet. Each target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, becoming confused for 1 minute on a failure. A target repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>

<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The dragon can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it sheds some of its scales, which turn into dry leaves and blow away. If it has no more uses of this ability, its Armor Class is reduced to 19 until it finishes a long rest.</li>
<li><strong>Woodland Stalker:</strong> When in a forested area, the dragon has advantage on Stealth checks. Additionally, when it speaks in such a place, it can project its voice such that it seems to come from all around, allowing it to remain hidden while speaking.</li>
<li><strong>Blood Toxicity (While Bloodied):</strong> The first time each turn a creature hits the dragon with a melee attack while within 10 feet of it, that creature makes a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Venomous Resurgence (1/Day):</strong> When the dragon is first bloodied, it immediately recharges its breath weapon, if its not already available. After doing so, it emanates a green gas that extends in a 15-foot radius around it. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature with resistance to poison damage loses it, and a creature without resistance or immunity to poison damage becomes vulnerable to poison damage instead. Either effect lasts until the start of the creatures next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 19). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:animal messenger, tongues, modify memory, scrying,  1/day:mass suggestion, telepathic bond,glibness</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite attack  it can Spit Poison.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tail:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.</li>
<li><strong>Spit Poison:</strong> The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also poisoned for 1 minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failure and ending the effect on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 22 Constitution saving throw  taking 80 (23d6) poison damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature with immunity to poison damage that fails the save takes no damage  but its poison immunity is reduced to resistance for the next hour.</li>
<li><strong>Honeyed Words:</strong> The dragons words sow doubt in the minds of those who hear them. One creature within 60 feet who can hear and understand the dragon makes a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the creature must use its reaction  if available  to make one attack against a creature of the dragons choice with whatever weapon it has to do so  moving up to its speed as part of the reaction if necessary. It need not use any special class features (such as Sneak Attack or Divine Smite) when making this attack. If it can't get in a position to attack the creature  it moves as far as it can toward the target before regaining its senses. A creature immune to being charmed is immune to this ability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tail Attack:</strong> When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Honeyed Words:</strong> The dragon uses Honeyed Words.</li>
<li><strong>Roar:</strong> Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack:</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.</li>

<li><strong>Hold Breath:</strong> The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the hydra fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, its heads lose coordination. It is rattled until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Heads:</strong> While the hydra has more than one head, it has advantage on Perception checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and it can't be flanked.</li>
<li><strong>Reactive Heads:</strong> For each head it has, the hydra can take one reaction per round, but not more than one per turn.</li>
<li><strong>Regenerating Heads:</strong> The hydra has five heads. Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in one turn, one of its heads dies. If all of its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows 2 heads for each head that was killed since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn.</li>
<li><strong>Toxic Secretions:</strong> Water within 1 mile of the hydras lair is poisoned. A creature other than the hydra that is immersed in the water or drinks the water makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 24 hours. On a success, the creature is immune to this poison for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Wakeful:</strong> When some of the hydras heads are asleep, others are awake.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The hydra bites once with each of its heads.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The hydra can take 2 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Rush:</strong> The hydra moves or swims up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement would pass through the space of creatures that are not incapacitated or prone, each creature makes a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone and the hydra can enter its space without treating it as difficult terrain. On a success, the hydra can't enter the creatures space, and the hydras movement ends. If this movement ends while the hydra is sharing a space with a creature, the creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.</li>
<li><strong>Wrap:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained until this grappled ends. The hydra can grapple one creature for each of its heads. When one of the hydras heads is killed while it is grappling a creature, the creature that killed the head can choose one creature to free from the grapple.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloaked Mind:</strong> When subjected to a divination effect that detects fiends or alignment, the malcubus makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the malcubuss nature is not detected.</li>
<li><strong>Evil:</strong> The malcubus radiates an Evil aura.</li>
<li><strong>Telepathic Bond:</strong> The malcubus can communicate telepathically with a charmed creature over any distance, even on a different plane of existence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claw (Malcubus Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Charm:</strong> The malcubus targets one humanoid on the same plane of existence within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is magically charmed for 1 day or until the malcubus charms another creature. The charmed creature obeys the malcubuss commands. The creature repeats the saving throw whenever it takes damage or if it receives a suicidal command. If a creatures saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to any malcubuss Charm for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Draining Kiss:</strong> The malcubus kisses a willing or charmed creature. The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw  taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. The targets hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount until it finishes a long rest  and the malcubus regains hit points equal to the same amount. If the target is charmed by the malcubus  the charm ends.</li>
<li><strong>Etherealness:</strong> The malcubus magically travels to the Ethereal Plane. While on the Ethereal Plane  the malcubus can see and hear into the Material Plane and can choose to make itself audible and hazily visible to creatures on the Material Plane. If a humanoid on the Material Plane invites the malcubus to do so  the malcubus can use an action to magically travel from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane.</li>
<li><strong>Dream (1/Day):</strong> While on the Ethereal Plane  the malcubus magically touches a sleeping humanoid that is not protected by a magic circle or protection from evil and good spell or similar magic. While the touch persists  the malcubus appears in the creatures dreams. The creature can end the dream at any time. If the dream lasts for 1 hour  the target gains no benefit from the rest  and the malcubus can use Charm on the creature even if its on a different plane of existence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shapeshift:</strong> The malcubus magically changes its form to a Medium or Small humanoid or into its true form. It can fly only in its true form. While shapeshifted, its statistics are unchanged except for its size and speed. Its equipment is not transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Living Shield:</strong> When a creature the malcubus can see hits it with an attack, the malcubus can give an order to a creature charmed by it within 5 feet. The charmed creature uses its reaction, if available, to swap places with the malcubus. The attack hits the charmed creature instead of the malcubus.</li>

<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petrifying Gaze:</strong> When a creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the medusa and can see the medusas eyes, it can choose to shut its eyes until the beginning of its next turn unless it is surprised or incapacitated. Otherwise, the medusa uses its petrifying gaze on the creature. If the medusa sees its own reflection and doesnt shut its eyes, it is subject to its own gaze.</li>
<li><strong>A creature subject to the medusas petrifying gaze makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw:</strong> If it rolls a natural 1 on the save, it is petrified instantly. If it otherwise fails the save, it is restrained as it begins to be petrified. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success and becoming petrified on a failure. The petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar powerful magic.</li>
</ul>

Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Dimension Door (4th-Level; V):</strong> The mage teleports to a location within 500 feet. They can bring along one willing Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If a creature would teleport to an occupied space  it takes 14 (4d6) force damage  and the spell fails.</li>

If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.</li>
<li><strong>Shield (1st-Level; V:</strong> When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.</li>

<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mirror Image:</strong> A magical illusion cloaks the phase monster, creating a reflection of the monster nearby and concealing its precise location. While the monster is not incapacitated, attack rolls against it have disadvantage. When a creature hits the phase monster with an attack, this trait stops working until the end of the phase monsters next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>

<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The phase monster attacks with its horns and its claws.</li>

If the target is a creature and the phase monster moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack  the target takes an additional 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage and makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Claws (True Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage  plus an additional 5 (2d4) slashing damage if the target is prone.</li>
<li><strong>Blood-Curdling Scream (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The phase monster unleashes a horrific screech. Each creature within 60 feet that can hear it makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  it is frightened for 1 minute. While frightened by Blood-Curdling Scream  a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the phase monster by the safest available route on each of its turns  unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesnt have line of sight to the phase monster  the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save  it is no longer frightened.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shapeshift:</strong> The phase monster magically changes its form to that of a Small goat or into its true form. While in goat form, it loses its fly speed and Mirror Image trait. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged in each form.</li>

<li><strong>Hold Breath:</strong> The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the hydra fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, its heads lose coordination. It is rattled until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Heads:</strong> While the hydra has more than one head, it has advantage on Perception checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and it can't be flanked.</li>
<li><strong>Reactive Heads:</strong> For each head it has, the hydra can take one reaction per round, but not more than one per turn.</li>
<li><strong>Regenerating Heads:</strong> The hydra has seven heads. Whenever the hydra takes 30 or more damage in one turn, one of its heads dies. If all of its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows 2 heads for each head that was killed since its last turn, unless it has taken at least 20 cold damage since its last turn.</li>
<li><strong>Toxic Secretions:</strong> Water within 1 mile of the hydras lair is poisoned. A creature other than the hydra that is immersed in the water or drinks the water makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 24 hours. On a success, the creature is immune to this poison for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Wakeful:</strong> When some of the hydras heads are asleep, others are awake.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The hydra bites once with each of its heads.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> If the pyrohydra has at least 4 heads  it breathes fire in all directions. Each creature within 30 feet makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw  taking 59 (17d6) fire damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The hydra can take 2 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Rush:</strong> The hydra moves or swims up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If this movement would pass through the space of creatures that are not incapacitated or prone, each creature makes a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone and the hydra can enter its space without treating it as difficult terrain. On a success, the hydra can't enter the creatures space, and the hydras movement ends. If this movement ends while the hydra is sharing a space with a creature, the creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.</li>
<li><strong>Wrap:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained until this grappled ends. The hydra can grapple one creature for each of its heads. When one of the hydras heads is killed while it is grappling a creature, the creature that killed the head can choose one creature to free from the grapple.</li>

<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fearsome Pursuit:</strong> The revenant can spend 1 minute focusing on a creature against which it has sworn vengeance. If the creature is dead or on another plane of existence, it learns that. Otherwise, after focusing, it knows the distance and direction to that creature, and so long as its moving in pursuit of that creature, it ignores difficult terrain. This effect ends if the revenant takes damage or ends its turn without moving for any reason.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The revenant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Recovery:</strong> If the revenant goes 1 minute without taking damage, it regains all its missing hit points.</li>
<li><strong>Relentless:</strong> When the revenant is reduced to 0 hit points, its body turns to dust. One minute later, its spirit inhabits a recently-dead humanoid corpse of its choice on the same plane of existence, awakening with 1 hit point.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The revenant makes two strangle attacks. It can replace one attack with Burning Hatred  if available.</li>
<li><strong>Strangle:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage  and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) if its a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends  the creature can't breathe  and the revenant can't strangle any other creature.</li>
<li><strong>Burning Hatred (Recharge 4-6):</strong> The revenant targets the focus of its Fearsome Pursuit  assuming the creature is within 30 feet. The target makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On a success  it takes half damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn.</li>

On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot.

<li><strong>Misty Recovery:</strong> When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point.

<li><strong>Resting Place:</strong> Every vampires lair contains a resting place, usually a coffin or sarcophagus, where the vampire must rest for at least an hour each day to recuperate its powers.

This petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar magic.</li>
