<h1>Ability Scores</h1>
<p>Every creature has six ability scores to describe their physical attributes and mental characteristics: <strong>Strength</strong> for muscle, <strong>Dexterity</strong> for agility and reflexes, <strong>Constitution</strong> for health and hardiness, <strong>Intelligence</strong> for memory and wits, <strong>Wisdom</strong> for awareness and intuition, and <strong>Charisma</strong> for charm and force of personality.<br />
An ability score of 10 or 11 is average. Adventurers can reach scores as high as 20, and monsters can have ability scores as high as 30.</p>

<p>Each ability has a modifier derived from its score. Table: Ability Score Modifiers lists the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30, but note only through extraordinary circumstances can a player character have an ability score below 8 or above 20.<br />
The most common rolls of the game—ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws—rely on the ability modifiers derived from the six ability scores. Because ability modifiers affect almost every roll, they come up during play more often than their associated scores.</p>
<h1>Ability Checks</h1>
<p>An ability check is made to determine whether a creature succeeds at a task other than an attack. The Narrator chooses which ability the creature should use and assigns a number representing the task’s Difficulty Class or DC. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC (see Table: Typical Difficulty Classes).</p>

</table>
<p>To make an ability check for a certain ability, roll a d20 and add the ability’s modifier and any other relevant bonuses and penalties. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the creature succeeds at the task. Otherwise, the creature fails, making little or no progress towards its goal.</p>
<h1>Passive Checks</h1>
<p>A passive check is an ability check made without die rolls. It can represent a creature’s typical result on a repeated task. To determine a character’s total for a passive check, add 10 to the ability’s modifier and any other relevant bonuses and penalties. If the character has advantage on the check, add 5, and if they have an expertise die add 3. If the character has disadvantage, subtract 5.<br />
The most common use of a passive check is a passive Wisdom (Perception) check. When a character first experiences a new scene or location, the Narrator describes what they sense based on their perceptiveness. A highly perceptive character might automatically detect dangers a less perceptive character wouldn’t notice, such as hidden opponents or traps.</p>
<h1>Contests</h1>
<p>When one creature’s efforts directly oppose another’s, the outcome is determined by contested ability checks—a contest.<br />
Each contestant makes an ability check as normal. Instead of comparing the results to a DC, the participant with the higher check wins the contest. If the results are tied, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest.<br />
An initiative check is a type of contested ability check to determine the order of action during an encounter.</p>
<h1>Advantage, Disadvantage,  Expertise, and DC Modifiers</h1>
<p>When the Narrator asks for an ability check, it might be modified by circumstances, spells, features, or traits that grant advantage (roll twice and use the higher result), disadvantage (roll twice and use the lower result), or expertise dice (roll and add an extra die).<br />
When the player knows about the factors which affect their action, these usually take the form of expertise dice or advantage or disadvantage. Expertise dice represent training and other details, and the character taking the action is fully aware of these effects.<br />
Sometimes the Narrator knows about factors which affect the difficulty of a task that the player is not aware of. In these situations the Narrator secretly applies modifiers to the DC of the ability check.</p>
<h1>Using Each Ability</h1>
<h2>Strength</h2>
<h3>Strength Checks</h3>
<p>Strength is used for any attempt to move or break something, to jump, climb, or swim beyond your usual physical limits, and to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.</p>
<h3>Attack Rolls and Damage</h3>
<p>When you make an attack roll using a weapon, you add your Strength modifier to the attack roll and the damage roll. Some weapons, such as the javelin, can also be thrown to make a ranged attack using Strength.</p>
<h3>Lifting and Carrying</h3>
<p>Your Strength score and modifier are both used to determine how much you can carry.<br />
<strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score × 15. This is the weight (in pounds) you can carry as you go about day-to-day business. If you exceed your carrying capacity, you are encumbered.<br />
<strong>Bulky Items.</strong> You can carry a number of bulky items equal to 1 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1). If you exceed this number, you are encumbered.<br />
<strong>Supply.</strong> You can carry a number of supplies equal to your Strength score in addition to the rest of your gear.<br />
<strong>Drag, Lift, or Push.</strong> You can drag, lift, or push up to your Strength score × 30. While moving weight in excess of your carrying capacity you are encumbered.<br />
<strong>Size and Strength.</strong> A Tiny creature’s carrying capacity is halved and it can’t carry bulky objects. For each size category above Medium, larger creatures double their carrying capacity, the number of bulky items they can carry, and the amount they can push, drag, or lift.</p>
<h2>Dexterity</h2>
<h3>Dexterity Checks</h3>
<p>Dexterity is used for any attempt to balance, move quietly, or to perform tasks focused on deft-fingered movements rather than force.</p>
<h3>Attack Rolls and Damage</h3>
<p>When you make an attack roll using a ranged weapon, you add your Dexterity modifier to the attack roll and the damage roll. When using a melee weapon with the finesse property, you can choose to use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier.</p>
<h3>Armor Class</h3>
<p>The armor you wear determines whether you add any, some, or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.</p>
<h2>Constitution</h2>
<h3>Constitution Checks</h3>
<p>Constitution is used for any attempt to physically push beyond normal limits over a period of time.</p>
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<p>Whenever you increase your hit point maximum when gaining a level or roll Hit Dice to recover hit points, you add your Constitution modifier. When rolling Hit Dice, you add the modifier to each dice roll.<br />
If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum also changes as if you always had the new modifier. </p>
<h2>Intelligence</h2>
<h3>Intelligence Checks</h3>
<p>Intelligence is frequently used to recall details of the shared adventure world, representing memory and education—knowledge obvious to a character even if unknown or forgotten by their player. It is also used to represent reasoning.</p>
<h3>Bonus Knowledge</h3>
<p>Having a higher Intelligence means having more knowledge than other characters. During character creation, for each point of your Intelligence modifier above 0 you can choose a skill specialty chosen from lore skills (Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, Religion). If you are not proficient in any lore skills you instead either gain proficiency with a lore skill, choose an extra language known, or pick a tool proficiency in one artisan’s tool, gaming kit, instrument, or vehicle.<br />
If your Intelligence modifier changes, it affects your bonus knowledge. When your Intelligence modifier increases, you can choose an additional skill specialty in the skills listed above as if you always had the new modifier. If your Intelligence modifier decreases you must remove the last benefit from your bonus knowledge. If your Intelligence modifier drops below 0, you don’t lose more knowledge than you gained from bonus knowledge.<br />
If you lose bonus knowledge due to a decrease in Intelligence, at the Narrator’s discretion you might choose a new bonus knowledge the next time your Intelligence modifier increases (instead of regaining the lost bonus knowledge).</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>Wizards and some warlocks use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability to determine their spell attack bonus and the saving throw DCs of the spells they cast. Intelligence also determines the number of spells a wizard can prepare each day.</p>
<h2>Wisdom</h2>
<h3>Wisdom Checks</h3>
<p>Wisdom is frequently used to notice details of the shared adventure world immediately around you, representing what you perceive in the moment—the present world obvious to your character as described by the Narrator. It is also used to understand feelings and emotions, and discern cryptic omens on an intuitive rather than logical level.</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>Clerics, druids, and some warlocks use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which determines their spell attack bonus and the saving throw DCs of the spells they cast. Wisdom also determines the number of spells a cleric or druid can prepare each day.</p>
<h2>Charisma</h2>
<h3>Charisma Checks</h3>
<p>Charisma is used in social situations to determine first impressions, to fit in or stand out, and to influence others.</p>
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>Bards, heralds, sorcerers, and some warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which determines their spell attack bonus and the saving throw DCs of the spells they cast. Charisma also determines the number of spells a herald can prepare each day.</p>
<h1>Working Together</h1>
<p>When multiple characters cooperate on a task, one character makes the ability check. They do so with advantage. While in initiative, the Help action is used for cooperative efforts.<br />
A character can’t help with a task that they couldn’t attempt alone, or that doesn’t benefit from multiple participants.</p>
<h2>Group Checks</h2>
<p>When all individuals in a scene are attempting the same thing as a group, such as climbing a cliff or sneaking up on an enemy camp, the Narrator calls for a group check (described in the Introduction).</p>
<h1>Proficiency Bonus</h1>
<p>Every creature has a proficiency bonus determined by its level (for PCs) or its challenge rating (for monsters and most NPCs). The bonus is used for ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws when a creature has a relevant proficiency.<br />
When applicable, you add your proficiency bonus to a d20 roll. If two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a roll, you still only add the bonus once.<br />
Some rules might modify your proficiency bonus before it is applied to a roll. If multiple rules modify the proficiency bonus in the same way, you still only modify it that way once.</p>
<h1>Saving Throws</h1>
<p>A saving throw (sometimes called a save) gives a creature a chance to avoid a threat. You make a saving throw when you’re at risk of harm. Each saving throw is made against a Difficulty Class, which is set by the effect that causes it. Although you typically will not want to, you can always choose to fail a saving throw.<br />
To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the ability modifier called for by the circumstances as well as any other relevant modifiers. A saving throw can have advantage, disadvantage, or expertise dice applied.<br />
All characters, and some monsters, gain saving throw proficiencies. Proficiency in a saving throw for a certain ability lets you add your proficiency bonus to saving throws using that ability. <br />
A successful save usually means that a creature avoids or reduces harm, while a failure means that the creature suffers more serious consequences.</p>
<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>While abilities provide broad descriptions of a character’s capabilities, a skill represents their training in a particular task such as Acrobatics or Deception. A character who has training in a skill is said to be proficient in it. Most skill proficiencies are acquired by adventurers during character creation from their choice of culture, background, and class.</p>
<h2>Using Skills</h2>
<p>When a character attempts an ability check, the Narrator may decide that a specific skill is relevant to the check. If a character is proficient in that skill, they may add their proficiency bonus to their ability check.<br />
Any skill can be used with any ability check, although some pairings are more common than others. For instance, the Deception skill is commonly used with Charisma ability checks.<br />
Sometimes the Narrator will ask for an ability check using a certain skill. Other times, a Narrator may ask for an ability check, and a player might ask whether one of their skills applies to the check. The Narrator is the sole arbiter of which skill, if any, applies to an ability check. The rules sometimes refer to a check with a skill but no ability specified. This refers to all ability checks using that skill regardless of which ability score is used.</p>
<h2>Skill Specialties</h2>
<p>In addition to having proficiency in a skill, a character may be an expert at a narrow area of specialization within that skill.<br />
A character gains two skill specialties at 1st level (plus bonus knowledge granted by Intelligence), and gains an additional specialty whenever their proficiency bonus increases (at levels 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level). A character may choose any specialty in a skill in which they are proficient. A character may not gain the same skill specialty twice.<br />
When a character makes an ability check to which their skill specialty applies, they gain an expertise die for that ability check. The Narrator determines whether the skill specialty applies.<br />
The Narrator may expand the list of skill specialties to meet the needs of the campaign world. Each of its cultures, historical eras, important organizations, and other unique details might furnish a specialty.</p>
<h2>List of Skills</h2>
<p>Characters can gain proficiency in the following skills. The Narrator determines which ability score is called for in a given situation.<br />
<strong>Acrobatics.</strong> An Acrobatics check allows a character to perform gymnastic feats such as rolling under a closing gate, swinging across a chasm on a rope, or keeping their balance on a narrow ledge. The most commonly used ability score is Dexterity. A character might use Strength to perform acrobatics while carrying a heavy burden or Constitution to do so against a heavy wind.<br />
Specialties: balancing, escape artistry, swinging, tumbling.<br />
<strong>Animal Handling.</strong> Animal Handling allows a character to train or control a domesticated animal, to handle a steed, or to communicate nonaggression to a wild beast. The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Charisma to command an animal’s attention, Strength to stay mounted on a rampaging bull, or Dexterity to stand on the back of a galloping horse.<br />
Specialties: calming, driving, farming,<br />
riding, training.<br />
<strong>Arcana.</strong> Arcana measures a character’s knowledge of magic and magical creatures. It can also be used to sense whether an area has magical qualities. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Dexterity to trace a complicated magical rune, or Wisdom to read very carefully and protect their sanity while interpreting forbidden eldritch secrets.<br />
Specialties: aberrations, constructs, detection, dragons, elementals, fey, forbidden knowledge, monstrosities, oozes, the planes.<br />
<strong>Athletics.</strong> A character makes an Athletics check to perform unusually difficult feats of swimming, running, climbing, or jumping. The most commonly used ability score is Strength. A character might use Dexterity to climb a smooth wall for a short distance or to jump onto a moving creature, Constitution to perform an athletic activity for more than a minute, or Intelligence to keep track of opposing players in a complex sport.<br />
Specialties: climbing, jumping, lifting, running, swimming, throwing.<br />
<strong>Culture.</strong> A Culture check allows a character to know the customs, laws, trade in regional products, and etiquette of cultures other than their own (a character is presumed to know about their own culture and background without requiring an ability check). Culture can also be used to communicate simple concepts with creatures whose language is unknown to a character. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Wisdom to avoid social blunders, Dexterity to perform an unfamiliar dance, or Charisma to track down a seller of a hard-to-find item.<br />
Specialties: courtly manners, etiquette, laws, linguistics, regional goods, streetwise, trade.<br />
<strong>Deception.</strong> The Deception skill is used when a character lies, misleads, or hides the truth whether verbally or otherwise. This ability check may be made against a DC set by the Narrator or may be opposed by a target’s Insight check. The most commonly used ability score is Charisma. A character might use Intelligence to compose a cipher or Constitution to conceal the effect of a wound or attack.<br />
Specialties: boasting, ciphers, concealing emotions, mimicry.<br />
<strong>Engineering.</strong> An Engineering check allows a character to know a fact or advance a project involving building, invention, or mathematics. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Dexterity to construct a tiny device or Strength to build a wall without assistance.<br />
Specialties: architecture, chemistry, explosives, gadgetry, mathematics, mechanical traps, siegecraft.<br />
<strong>History.</strong> The History skill measures a character’s knowledge of past events. Intelligence is nearly always the ability score used with this skill.<br />
Specialties: arts, empires, genealogy, legends, wars.<br />
<strong>Insight.</strong> An Insight check can be used for reading a creature’s intentions or motives. The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Dexterity to interrupt an enemy’s sudden action.<br />
Specialties: detecting lies, reading emotions, sensing motives.<br />
<strong>Intimidation.</strong> A character makes an Intimidation check to alter someone’s behavior by frightening or threatening them. A single Intimidation check can also be used as part of an interrogation, though further checks rarely offer different results. The Narrator sets the DC of the check based on the target’s bravery and the circumstances of the check; some creatures can’t be intimidated. The most commonly used ability scores for Intimidation checks are Charisma (for verbal threats) and Strength (for physical threats). A character might use Wisdom to discern a creature’s weak point, and a spellcaster might use their spellcasting ability score to summon frightening energies.<br />
Specialties: authority, ferocity, interrogation, subtle threats, weapon displays.<br />
<strong>Investigation.</strong> Investigation is used for actively searching, looking for clues, gathering information, experimentation, and research. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Charisma to gather rumors or Wisdom to intuit which tomes and books in a library will be the most efficacious.<br />
Specialties: appraisal, deciphering, forensics, gathering rumors, research, trapfinding.<br />
<strong>Medicine.</strong> A character can perform a Medicine check to stabilize a dying creature, treat or diagnose a disease or poison, or determine a cause of death. The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Intelligence to diagnose a rare poison or Constitution to nurse someone through a lengthy and dangerous illness.<br />
Specialties: animals, autopsy, diseases, herbalism, poisons.<br />
<strong>Nature.</strong> The Nature skill measures a character’s knowledge of natural terrains, beasts, plants, and hazards. It can also be used to sense whether a creature is the product of this world or of another plane of existence. Unlike Survival, the Nature skill doesn’t necessarily imply practical experience with a phenomenon. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Wisdom to recognize a hazard or Charisma to bring calm to an errant elemental presence disrupting an abandoned druid’s grove.<br />
Specialties: astronomy, beast lore, farming, fey, plant lore, weather.<br />
<strong>Perception.</strong> A character’s Perception measures what they are able to see, hear, or otherwise sense (unlike Investigation, Perception doesn’t involve approaching, searching, or handling an object of study.) The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Constitution for a long stretch of sentinel duty, or Intelligence to pick up on changes to the type of stone bricks used deeper than elsewhere in a dungeon.<br />
Specialties: farsight, invisible objects, listening, scent.<br />
<strong>Performance.</strong> A Performance check allows a character to entertain an audience with singing, acting, or the like. It also allows a character to write or compose music, literature, or other artistic endeavors to entertain future audiences. The most commonly used ability score is Charisma, especially for performances before an audience. Writing, composing, or painting might instead use Intelligence or Wisdom. A display of martial prowess might require Dexterity or Strength.<br />
Specialties: acting, composing, dancing, fine art, singing, speaking, writing.<br />
<strong>Persuasion.</strong> A character makes a Persuasion check to convince or influence someone through logic, flattery, or negotiation (unlike a Deception check, a Persuasion check is made in some degree of good faith.) The Narrator sets the DC of the Persuasion check based on what the character is asking for and how the target feels about the character; some persuasion attempts may be impossible. The most commonly used ability score is Charisma. Wisdom might be used for gauging what offers would sway a creature, or Intelligence if it is a matter entirely about logic.<br />
Specialties: bribery, flattery, leadership, negotiation, peacemaking.<br />
<strong>Religion.</strong> Religion measures a character’s knowledge of gods, religions, rites, and systems of morality. A character can also try to use it to sense if a place, person, or object has the Good or Evil alignment traits or a holy or unholy aura. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. Wisdom is used for sensing alignment and determining whether an action is moral according to a particular philosophy. Charisma can be used for preaching.<br />
Specialties: alignment, celestials, cults, fiends, holy symbols, gods, morality, prophecy, undead.<br />
<strong>Sleight of Hand.</strong> A character makes a Sleight of Hand check to perform legerdemain, pickpocket, hide an object on another creature, make a concealed hand signal, or otherwise deceive the eyes with feats of agility. Dexterity is nearly always the ability score used with this skill.<br />
Specialties: distraction, pickpocketing, legerdemain.<br />
<strong>Stealth.</strong> Stealth is used to hide or avoid notice. A creature’s Stealth check is usually opposed by a potential observer’s Perception check. The most commonly used ability score for Stealth is Dexterity. Constitution might be used for staying still for a very long time, Intelligence for casing out an unfrequented route, and Charisma for blending anonymously into a crowd.<br />
Specialties: anonymity, camouflage, casing.<br />
<strong>Survival.</strong> The Survival skill allows a character to perform the tasks necessary to thrive in the wilderness: hunting, tracking, avoiding natural hazards, and traveling without getting lost (unlike Nature, a Survival check doesn’t imply knowledge of the trouble you’re avoiding or tracking.) The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Constitution to weather a storm or Intelligence to follow a route marked on an old map.<br />
Specialties: dungeoneering, foraging, hunting, tracking, wayfinding.</p>
<h2>Stealth and Hiding</h2>
<p>To attempt to hide from a creature, you must be unseen (behind something, obscured, invisible, or otherwise out of sight) and unheard by that creature, as well as undetected by any other special senses that it might possess. Make a Stealth check. This check’s total is used until you stop hiding or are discovered. If a creature sees you while you are hiding or makes a successful Perception check to locate you, or you make a noise that it can overhear, you are discovered and are no longer hidden from that creature.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Ability Check Criticals</h1>
<p>When you use a skill and roll a natural 20 and succeed, or roll a natural 1 and fail, roll 1d6 to determine what special effect occurs. Because of the benefits of ability check criticals, some players may try a variety of easy ability checks to get a critical effect. The Narrator is always the arbiter of these critical effects and can rule that if an ability check is superfluous or insignificant, any resulting natural 20s and natural 1s have no special effect.<br />
<strong>Tool Kits.</strong> Whether or not a tool kit is appropriate for an Ability Check Critical and for which type it qualifies is at the Narrator’s discretion.</p>
<h2>Arcane</h2>
<p>Arcane criticals only occur when an active magical effect is involved. This might be the response to a <em>counterspell</em> or <em>dispel magic,</em> the activation of a specific magic item, or interaction with a ritual or permanent enchantment. When an arcane critical success or critical failure would not apply to the effect that activated it, reroll.</p>
<h3>Critical Success</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arcane Surge.</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points last 1 hour.  </li>
<li><strong>Comfort in the Arcane.</strong> For the next 24 hours, when making Arcana checks, you can choose to gain a result as if you had rolled a 10 on the die instead of rolling.  </li>
<li><strong>Expanded Use.</strong> If the magic item or effect targets a set number of targets, you may add one additional target within range.  </li>
<li><strong>Free Use.</strong> If activating a scroll or item with charges (such as a wand), you do not expend the scroll or any charges.  </li>
<li><strong>Lucky Magic.</strong> You gain an expertise die on Arcana checks for the next 24 hours.  </li>
<li><strong>Metamagic Use.</strong> Choose one minor metamagic effect from those found in the sorcerer class and apply it to the spell.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Critical Failure</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arcane Feedback.</strong> You take 1 point of damage per spell level.  </li>
<li><strong>Break Device.</strong> The activated item gains the broken condition or, in the case of a scroll, it is destroyed entirely.  </li>
<li><strong>Delayed Activation.</strong> At some point within the next 1d12 hours, the magic device randomly activates. The target is chosen by the Narrator.  </li>
<li><strong>Misaligned Aiming.</strong> The device activates, but the target of the item’s effect or spell changes to a target of the Narrator’s choosing.  </li>
<li><strong>Unlucky Magic.</strong> You are rattled for the next 2d4 hours.  </li>
<li><strong>Wasteful Usage.</strong> If activating an item with charges (such as a wand), you use 5 charges (even if the device does not activate).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Facts and Discoveries</h2>
<p>Includes skills such as Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival.</p>
<h3>Critical Success</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Doctorate.</strong> This subject is one of your areas of study and some of it is coming back to you. For the next 24 hours, you gain an expertise die on ability checks using this skill so long as the check is for similar subjects.  </li>
<li><strong>Forgotten Language.</strong> Choose the language most closely associated with the target (if none or if you already know the language, roll again). If this is your first time getting a critical success with that language, you remember that you studied it long ago. Write down the language. The next time you roll this result, you permanently learn the language.  </li>
<li><strong>Moment of Revelation.</strong> You gain the benefits of a single <em>augury</em> spell (although no magic is involved).  </li>
<li><strong>Related Expertise.</strong> For the next hour, you may add half your proficiency bonus to any Intelligence or Wisdom check that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.  </li>
<li><strong>Relevant Tidbit.</strong> You recall some important bit of information relevant to the target.  </li>
<li><strong>View Auras.</strong> For 1 minute, you gain the benefits of <em>detect magic</em> against targets related to your check.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Critical Failure</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aggressive Handling.</strong> If you are examining something, you either break it or worsen a creature’s attitude towards you (as Gossip, page 416). When this does not apply, reroll.  </li>
<li><strong>Arcane Fatigue.</strong> You lose one of your highest level spell slots. When this does not apply, reroll.  </li>
<li><strong>Boring Topic.</strong> You find this topic incredibly boring. For the next 24 hours, you take a –2 penalty on checks against similar targets.  </li>
<li><strong>Earworm.</strong> You are trying to concentrate but all you can remember is an annoying tune. For the next hour, you cannot gain expertise dice on Intelligence and Wisdom checks.  </li>
<li><strong>Frightening Revelation.</strong> You become frightened for 1d4+1 rounds. There is no direct source of your fear.  </li>
<li><strong>Misinformation.</strong> You are positive of the veracity of some false bit of information.</li>
</ol>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Medicine</h2>
<h3>Critical Success</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buffer.</strong> The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. These temporary hit points last 1 hour.  </li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Checkup.</strong> The target heals 1 level of fatigue or strife (reroll if neither applies).  </li>
<li><strong>Expertise.</strong> For the next 24 hours, when making Medicine checks, you can choose to gain a result as if you had rolled a 10 on the die instead of rolling.  </li>
<li><strong>Repeat the Procedure.</strong> You may treat your next Medicine check as a natural 20 so long as it is made before you complete a long rest. This does not result in a critical success.  </li>
<li><strong>Spur Natural Healing.</strong> The target’s natural healing improves dramatically. For the next 24 hours, double the hit points the target regains from spending Hit Dice during a short rest.  </li>
<li><strong>Superb Healing.</strong> The target regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Critical Failure</h3>
