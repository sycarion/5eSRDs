<h1>Difficult Terrain</h1>
<p>If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet of movement. Difficult Terrain isn't cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn't.</p>
<p>A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains any of the following or something similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>A creature that isn't Tiny or your ally</li>
<li>Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or larger</li>
<li>Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth</li>
<li>Liquid that's between shin- and waist-deep</li>
<li>A narrow opening sized for a creature one size smaller than you</li>
<li>A slope of 20 degrees or more</li>
</ul>
