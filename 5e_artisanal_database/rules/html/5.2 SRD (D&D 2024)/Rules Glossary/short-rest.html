<h1>Short Rest</h1>
<p>A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of the Rest.</strong> When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Spend Hit Point Dice.</strong> You can spend one or more of your Hit Point Dice to regain Hit Points. For each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1 Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional Hit Point Die after each roll.</p>
<p><strong>Special Feature.</strong> Some features are recharged by a Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interrupting the Rest.</em></strong> A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling Initiative</li>
<li>Casting a spell other than a cantrip</li>
<li>Taking any damage</li>
</ul>
<p>An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.</p>
