<h1>Long Rest</h1>
<p>A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.</p>
<p>During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Benefits of the Rest.</em></strong> To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Regain All HP.</strong> You regain all lost Hit Points and all spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Scores Restored.</strong> If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustion Reduced.</strong> If you have the Exhaustion condition, its level decreases by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Special Feature.</strong> Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interrupting the Rest.</em></strong> A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling Initiative</li>
<li>Casting a spell other than a cantrip</li>
<li>Taking any damage</li>
<li>1 hour of walking or other physical exertion</li>
</ul>
<p>If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. <em>See also</em> "Short Rest."</p>
<p>You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.</p>
