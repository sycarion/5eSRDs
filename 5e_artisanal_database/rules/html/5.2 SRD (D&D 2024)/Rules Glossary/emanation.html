<h1>Emanation [Area of Effect]</h1>
<p>An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a creature or an object in all directions. The effect that creates an Emanation specifies the distance it extends.</p>
<p>An Emanation moves with the creature or object that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a stationary effect.</p>
<p>An Emanation's origin (creature or object) isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.</p>
