<h1>Line [Area of Effect]</h1>
<p>A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point of origin in a straight path along its length and covers an area defined by its width. The effect that creates a Line specifies its length and width.</p>
<p>A Line's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.</p>
