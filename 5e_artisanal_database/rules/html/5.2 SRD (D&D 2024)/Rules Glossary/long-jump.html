<h1>Long Jump</h1>
<p>When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your Strength score if you</p>
<p>move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement.</p>
<p>If you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the Prone condition.</p>
<p>This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle.</p>
