<h1>Feats</h1>
<h2>Feat Descriptions</h2>
<p>The feats that follow are organized by category— Origin, General, Fighting Style, or Epic Boon—and alphabetized in each category.</p>
<h3>Parts of a Feat</h3>
<p>The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat's name.</p>
<p><strong>Category.</strong> A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you're instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin category, that category must appear under the feat's name. If you're instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any category.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite.</strong> To take a feat, you must meet any prerequisite in its description unless a feature allows you to take the feat without the prerequisite. If a prerequisite includes a class, you must have at least 1 level in that class to take the feat.</p>
<p><strong>*Benefit.</strong> The benefits of a feat are detailed after any prerequisites are listed. If you have a feat, you gain its benefits.</p>
