<h1>Spells (J)</h1>
<h4>Jump</h4>
<p><em>1st-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a grasshopper's hind leg)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You touch a creature. The creature's jump distance is tripled until the spell ends.</p>
<h1>Spells (K)</h1>
<h4>Knock</h4>
<p><em>2nd-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.</p>
<p>A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.</p>
<p>If you choose a target that is held shut with <em>arcane lock</em>, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.</p>
