<h1>Feats</h1>
<p>A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides.</p>
<p>At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.</p>
<p>You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow-perhaps by a withering curse-you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.</p>
<h2>Grappler</h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher</em></p>
<p>You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.</li>
<li>You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.</li>
</ul>
