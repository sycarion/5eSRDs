<h1>NPCs</h1>
<p>This section contains statistics for various humanoid non-player characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign, including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.</p>
<h1>Customizing NPCs</h1>
<p>There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.</p>
<p><strong><em>Racial Traits</em></strong>. You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn't alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the <em>Player's Handbook</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spell Swaps</em></strong>. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC's spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn't alter an NPC's challenge rating.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armor and Weapon Swaps</em></strong>. You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC's armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC's challenge rating.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Items</em></strong>. The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.</p>

<h6>Actions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Dagger</em></strong>. <em>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong>Archmages</strong> are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption.</p>
<p>An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 8 (3,900 XP)</p>
<p><strong><em>Assassinate</em></strong>. During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Evasion</em></strong>. If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sneak Attack</em></strong>. Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
<h6>Actions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack</em></strong>. The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shortsword</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Light Crossbow</em></strong>. <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>Trained in the use of poison, <strong>assassins</strong> are remorseless killers who work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can afford them.</p>

<p><strong>Bandits</strong> rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates</strong> are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.</p>
<h1>Bandit Captain</h1>

<h6>Actions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack</em></strong>. The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged attacks with its daggers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scimitar</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dagger</em></strong>. <em>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</p>
<h6>Reactions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Parry</em></strong>. The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.</p>
<p>It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The <strong>bandit captain</strong> has these qualities in spades.</p>
<p>In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the <strong>pirate captain</strong> is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.</p>
<p>More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.</p>
