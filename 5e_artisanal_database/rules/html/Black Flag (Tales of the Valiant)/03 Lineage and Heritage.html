<h2>Lineages</h2>

<p>Your beastkin character has the following hereditary traits.</p>

<p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium or Small. Beastkin vary in weight and height, depending on their Beast characteristics. Most are between 4 and 8 feet tall, but if you choose to play a beastkin shorter than 4 feet, you can choose your size to be Small. Your weight varies depending on your Beast characteristics.

<p><strong><em>Animal Instinct.</em></strong> You have proficiency in either the Perception or Survival skill (your choice).</p>
<p><strong><em>Natural Weapons.</em></strong> You have claws, horns, hooves, fangs, spines, or a similar adaptation that serves as a natural weapon. Work with your GM to determine what type of natural weapon you possess and decide whether it does bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can use your natural weapon to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your STR or DEX modifier damage (choose which during character creation) of your chosen type, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
