<h1>Gods &amp; Pantheons</h1>
<h2>Fantasy Historical Pantheons</h2>
<p>The Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical Earth religions. Mix and match these deities outside of a historical context to serve your game's needs.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Pantheon</h3>
<p>These gods are a dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos. They maintain the universal forces of truth, justice, law, and order. As kings and queens lead their vassals, these gods guide their worshippers through mortality and beyond.</p>

<h3>Greek Pantheon</h3>
<p>These gods rule from a sky-high mountain realm called Olympus, but they are far from removed from mortal affairs. Deities of this pantheon possess terrifying power over natural forces but are ruled by all-too-human passions that cause them to perpetually bicker, fall in love, and war with one another—often at the expense of mortal bystanders caught in their wake.</p>

<h3>Norse Pantheon</h3>
<p>These gods hold court over harsh lands that can claim the lives of mortals not strong or clever enough to survive. This struggle is mirrored in the pantheon's cosmic struggle: perpetual warfare against forces working to end everything. Their powers and bombastic personalities reflect the strong leadership and decisive action required to survive, while embracing life's pleasures.</p>
