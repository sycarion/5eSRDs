<h1>Conditions</h1>
<h2>Blinded</h2>
<ul>
<li>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
<li>Attack rolls against a blinded creature have advantage, and a blinded creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>

<h2>Charmed</h2>

<h2>Exhaustion</h2>
<p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</p>
<p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p>
<p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering two levels of exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p>
<p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description. All exhaustion effects end if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below one.</p>
<p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by one, provided that the creature has also had some food and drink.</p>
