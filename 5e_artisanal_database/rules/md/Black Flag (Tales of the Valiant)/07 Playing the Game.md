# Playing The Game

## Ability Modifiers

All checks in the game are tied to one of the six ability modifiers-Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Wisdom (WIS), Intelligence (INT), or Charisma (CHA). You add one of these six ability modifiers to every check. The rules typically dictate which modifier you must use for a particular check, but in cases where no ability is listed, the GM decides which one is relevant.

## Proficiency Bonus

All PCs have a proficiency bonus (PB) determined by their level. Monsters also have this bonus incorporated into the various components of their stat blocks.

You only ever add your PB to a roll once. For example, if two different rules allow you to add your PB to a WIS save, you still add it only once.

Occasionally, you might double or halve your PB before you add it to a roll. If some circumstance suggests that your PB applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and double or halve it only once.

If your PB doesn't apply to a roll, doubling doesn't change that. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your PB when you make INT (History) checks.

In general, don't double your PB for attack rolls or saves. If some feature or effect allows you to do so, the above rules still apply.

## Determining Success Or Failure

In most cases, you measure your check result against a target number the GM sets for you, called a difficulty class (DC). If your check result is equal to or higher than the DC, your roll succeeds! If it's less than the DC, you fail.

### Determining Dc

Most of the time, the rules tell the GM what a DC should be. For example, a PC must get a check result of 19 or higher to successfully attack a creature with an AC 19 (AC is one example of a pre-determined DC).

When the rules don't provide a DC, the GM sets an appropriate number. If you're the GM and you aren't sure, think about how hard you want a task to be. Then consult the Typical Difficulty Class table to assign a number. You can always set it at a number that isn't divisible by 5.

### Table: Typical Difficulty Class

| DIFFICULTY | CHANCE OF SUCCESS           | DC           |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Easy       | High Chance of Success      | 10 or less   |
| Medium     | Moderate Chance of Success  | 15           |
| Hard       | Low Chance of Success       | 20           |
| Very Hard  | Almost No Chance of Success | 25 or higher |

## Luck

Every PC has a special resource called Luck. You use Luck to influence the result of any check.

### Gaining Luck

When you create your character, start with 0 Luck. You gain Luck in the following ways:

- Once per turn, when you fail to hit with an attack roll or fail a save, gain 1 Luck.
- The GM can award 1 Luck as a reward for a clever idea, excellent roleplaying, or pursuing an interesting- rather than optimal-choice.
- The GM can award any amount of Luck to one or more PCs for surviving difficult encounters or achieving story goals (in addition to XP or other rewards).

### Losing Luck

You can have a maximum of 5 Luck at one time. If you already have 5 Luck and gain more, you must immediately roll a d4 and reset your Luck total to the number rolled.

### Spending Luck

You spend Luck to add a 1-for-1 bonus to any check you make. For example, if you have 4 Luck and roll a 13 on the die, you can spend 2 Luck to make your result a 15 (leaving you with 2 Luck for later). Luck can't stop a critical miss on a 1 or create a critical hit by adding up to 20 (see Critical Miss or Critical Hit in this chapter).

Alternatively, immediately after you make a check (attack, ability check, or save), you can spend 3 Luck to reroll a d20 used for the check.

Note that Luck gained from a failed attack or save can't be used to enhance the same roll that generated the Luckâ€”you only accrue Luck after you officially fail the roll!

# Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes special circumstances allow you to roll a check with advantage or force you to roll a check with disadvantage.

- **Rolling with advantage** means that you roll two d20s, then use the higher of the two numbers to calculate your check result.
- **Rolling with disadvantage** means you roll two d20s, then use the lower of the two numbers to calculate your check result.

For example, if you have advantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 17. If you instead have disadvantage, use the 5.

If two or more favorable situations grant advantage, you still roll only one additional d20, and the same is true for disadvantage. You only ever roll a maximum of two d20s.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel each other out, and you roll only one d20. This works no matter how many circumstances grant advantage or impose disadvantage. If they conflict at all, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and a rule lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and roll a 1 and a 13, you could reroll the 1 or the 13, but not both.

## The Three Types Of Checks

### Attack Rolls

Attack rolls are checks used almost exclusively during combat for attacking.

#### Relevant Proficiencies

If you have proficiency with the weapon you're making an attack with, making an unarmed strike attack (all creatures are proficient with this), or casting a spell you know or have prepared, add your PB to the attack roll.

### Saves

Saves are checks made to resist or avoid threats from spells, traps, poisons, diseases, or similar hazards. The GM normally asks you to make a save because your character is at risk of harm. There are six types of saves in the game, each tied to one of the six ability scores: STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, or CHA.

To make a save, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, if your GM asks you to make a DEX save, roll a d20 and add your DEX modifier to find the check result.

The DC for a save is determined by the effect that calls for it. For example, when you make a save against a spell, the DC is determined by the caster's relevant ability modifier and PB.

The consequences of success or failure are described after an effect's DC. A successful save usually means that you suffer no harm, or partial harm, from an effect.

#### Relevant Proficiencies

Your character class gives you proficiency in at least two saves. The wizard, for example, is proficient in INT and WIS saves. Talents and similar features can also give you proficiency with a certain type of save. Add your PB when you make a save you have proficiency with.

### Ability Checks

When you want to do something that isn't covered by an attack roll or save, make an ability check. Since ability checks are so wide-ranging, they are more complex than the other two types of checks.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success. You overcome the challenge. Otherwise, it's a failure. You make no progress toward the objective, or you make some progress but also suffer a setback, as determined by the GM.

#### Contests

Sometimes your efforts are directly opposed by someone else. This can occur when multiple creatures try to do the same thing but only one can succeed, such as snatching a magic ring falling to the floor. It can also occur when one creature tries to prevent another one from accomplishing a goal-for example, a monster might try to force open a door while an adventurer holds it closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Every participant in a contest makes an ability check. Apply appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, compare the check results to each other. The participant with the highest check result wins the contest and either succeeds at the action or prevents other participants from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same. Thus, one participant might win by default. If two creatures tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep it closed, a tie means that the door stays shut.

#### Passive Checks

A **passive check** doesn't involve any die rolls. This kind of ability check can represent an average outcome for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again. Or a GM can use it to secretly determine whether a PC succeeds at something the player doesn't know to try to do, such as noticing a hidden monster.

A passive check total is called a **score**. Here's how to determine a character's passive score:

- 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check.
- If the character has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

So, for example, if a 1st-level character has a WIS +2 ability modifier and is proficient in the Perception skill, they have a passive Perception score of 14 (10 + 2 for WIS modifier + 2 for PB).

#### Working Together

Sometimes two or more creatures work together. In this case, the creature with the highest ability modifier is designated the lead for the effort. That creature can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help others give. In combat, a creature can only provide this kind of assistance by taking the Help action.

A creature can only provide help if they have capacity to do the task. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a creature who lacks that proficiency can't provide help with a lock-picking job. Moreover, a creature can provide help only when their assistance would be productive. Threading a needle doesn't get any easier with another pair of hands.

#### Group Checks

When several individuals try to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group check. In this case, characters who are skilled at a task help cover for those who aren't.

To make a group check, each member of the group makes the ability check separately. If at least half the members succeed (round up), the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don't come up often, and they're most useful when all characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers navigate a swamp, the GM might call for a WIS (Survival) group check to see if the whole party can avoid quicksand and sinkholes. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into a hazard.

#### Relevant Proficiencies

Two main types of proficiencies can modify an ability check.

##### Skill Proficiencies

Every PC starts the game with skill proficiencies granted by their background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents. Proficiency in a skill means you can add your PB to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, you don't add your PB to ability checks.

For example, if a character attempts to climb a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a STR (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the player rolls a d20, adds their character's STR modifier and then adds PB. If the character lacks that proficiency, the player rolls a d20 and adds only their character's STR modifier.

The rules in a scenario usually prompt a GM to ask for an ability check using a specific skill. For example, "Make a WIS (Perception) check." Sometimes though, more than one skill might reasonably apply. You can ask the GM if a different skill is relevant to the check. If the GM agrees, you can use that skill instead.

See the following Skills section for a full list of skill proficiencies and more information about their use.

##### Tool Proficiencies

Some tasks require a particular tool to accomplish, such as repairing an item, forging a document, or picking a lock. Your background, class, heritage, lineage, or talents can give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your PB to any ability check you make using that tool.

Tool use isn't tied to a single ability modifier. The check depends on what you're trying to do, at the GM's discretion. For example, when using construction tools, the GM might ask for a DEX (Construction Tools) check to carve out fine detail or a STR (Construction Tools) check to make something out of particularly hard wood.

### Skill Descriptions

These descriptions include different ways you can use a skill.

#### Acrobatics

Associated Ability: DEX Your DEX (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as running across a sheet of ice, balancing on a tightrope, or staying upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for a DEX (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

#### Animal Handling

Associated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) When you want to calm a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a WIS (Animal Handling) check. You also make a WIS (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you try something risky.

#### Arcana

Associated Ability: Intelligence (INT) Your INT (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about matters such as spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and inhabitants of those planes.

#### Athletics

Associated Ability: Strength (STR) Your STR (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include scaling a rain-slicked cliff, avoiding hazards on a climb, jumping unusually far, pulling off a stunt while jumping, swimming in treacherous currents, or staying afloat when a creature tries to pull you underwater.

#### Deception

Associated Ability: Charisma (CHA) Your CHA (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, verbally or through actions. Deception ranges from misleading through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, cheat at gambling, or wear a convincing disguise.

#### History

Associated Ability: Intelligence (INT) Your INT (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about matters such as legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

#### Insight

Associated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) Your WIS (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. This involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

#### Intimidation

Associated Ability: Charisma (CHA) An attempt to influence someone through threats, hostility, and physical violence requires a CHA (Intimidation) check. Examples include prying information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down, or using a broken bottle to suggest that a sneering vizier reconsider.

#### Investigation

Associated Ability: Intelligence (INT) Looking around for clues and making deductions based on those clues involves an INT (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls for a fragment of hidden knowledge might also call for an INT (Investigation) check.

#### Medicine

Associated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) A WIS (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize an unconscious companion at 0 HP or diagnose an illness.

#### Nature

Associated Ability: Intelligence (INT) Your INT (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about matters such as terrain, plants and animals, weather, and natural cycles.

#### Perception

Associated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) Your WIS (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of surroundings and keenness of senses. For example, you might try to overhear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or catch the scent of monsters skulking through the forest. You might also try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, such as orcs lying in ambush, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

#### Performance

Associated Ability: Charisma (CHA) Your CHA (Performance) check determines how well you delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or other forms of entertainment.

#### Persuasion

Associated Ability: Charisma (CHA) When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask for a CHA (Persuasion) check. You use Persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd.

#### Religion

Associated Ability: Intelligence (INT) Your INT (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about matters such as deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and secret cults.

#### Sleight Of Hand

Associated Ability: Dexterity (DEX) An act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting an item on someone else or concealing an object on your person, calls for a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

#### Stealth

Associated Ability: Dexterity (DEX) Make a DEX (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone.

#### Survival

Associated Ability: Wisdom (WIS) The GM might ask you to make a WIS (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

## Adventuring

This section covers the various rules that come with exploring the world and some important ways PCs interact with the environment.

### Tracking Time

During the majority of gameplay, time passes much as it does in our world. Actions and events are measured in minutes, hours, days, and years. Gameplay during encounters is often measured more closely in rounds and turns.

When passage of time matters, the GM determines how long a task takes. A GM should always feel free to shift between scales to match what's happening in the game and to keep the story moving.

**_Minutes._** In tense environments like a dungeon full of patrolling monsters, a GM is likely to track PC progress in a scale of minutes. It might take a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good 10 minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable. Minutes are also used in some dangerous situations, like measuring how long a PC can hold their breath before suffocating. Minutes also factor into spellcasting. Many spell durations are measured in minutes and ritual spells always take 10 minutes or more to cast.

**_Hours._** In less time-sensitive situations like touring a city or exploring a large forest, a scale of hours is more appropriate. Hours also factor into how often PCs need to rest and how much time passes during a short rest versus a long rest. Hours also factor into how much a PC can accomplish by engaging with downtime activities.

**_Days._** For long journeys, a scale of days works best. For example, a journey could take multiple days that are (mostly) uneventful. A GM might roll on a random encounter table once per day to see if anything notable happens during the journey. If it does, the time scale might shift into hours to explore, minutes to investigate, or rounds to fight! Days also factor into how often PCs can use some abilities or magic items.

### Movement

Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope- all sorts of movement play into fantasy adventures.

The GM can summarize movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day." Even in a large dungeon, the GM might summarize movement between encounters: "After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch."

Sometimes though, it's important to know more precisely how long it takes to get somewhere. Rules for this depend on a few factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.

#### Speed

Every creature has one or more ways to move through the world, called speed. Speed is the distance a creature can cover with a move. On a character sheet or in monster statistics, speed is always listed with a number measured in feet. All creatures have a base walking speed. Creatures that have no ground-based movement have a base walking speed of 0. In addition to base walking speed, creatures can have one or more of the following additional movement speeds.

#### Burrowing

Creatures with a burrowing speed can move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A creature can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait for that.

#### Climbing

Creatures with a climbing speed can move with ease on vertical surfaces. Unlike most creatures, a creature with a climbing speed doesn't need to spend extra movement when climbing.

#### Flying

A creature with a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly through the air. Most creatures with a flying speed must stay in continual motion to remain airborne, but some can hover. If a creature can hover, it is noted in parentheses after its flying speed.

#### Swimming

Creatures with a swimming speed can move with ease in water or similar liquids. Unlike most creatures, a creature with a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement when swimming. In addition, creatures with a swimming speed don't make melee weapon attacks at disadvantage while underwater.

### Special Movement Rules

Adventurers often find themselves traversing dangerous environments or navigating perilous situations that require special kinds of movement. PCs might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go. In such circumstances, the following special movement rules apply.

#### Climbing

While climbing, you move at half speed-each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot. If you climb in difficult terrain, each foot of movement costs 2 extra feet. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds might require one or more successful STR (Athletics) checks. Failing such a check might cause a creature to fall.

#### Crawling

While crawling, you move at half speed-each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot. If you crawl in difficult terrain, each foot of movement costs 2 extra feet.

#### Jumping

Several factors determine how far and how high a creature can jump.

**_Long Jump._** When you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to half your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only a quarter of your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs 1 foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At the GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 STR (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you attempt to land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

**_High Jump._** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your STR modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs 1 foot of movement. At the GM's discretion, you might be able to make a STR (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

#### Swimming

While swimming, you move at half speed-each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot. At the GM's discretion, gaining distance in rough water might also require a successful STR (Athletics) check. Failing such a check might cause a creature to start drowning. Certain weapons are also more difficult to use while swimming.

### Difficult Terrain

Adventurers often travel on rough ground: dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, and sheets of ice. Such areas are considered difficult terrain. You move at half speed in difficult terrain. Moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed. If two or more sources of difficult terrain occur in the same space, you still move at only half speed. Difficult terrain is often a natural part of the landscape, but some class features or spells, such as entangle, can create it for a short time. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

### Forced Movement

Some effects or consequences move you against your will. Forced movement never provokes opportunity attacks from hostile creatures.

#### Falling

Falling is a common adventuring hazard. At the end of a fall, a creature lands prone and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell (to a maximum of 20d6) unless it has a feature or trait that allows it to avoid taking damage from the fall. In most cases, falling happens so quickly that a creature takes the damage immediately. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its flying speed reduced to 0, or otherwise loses the ability to move, it immediately falls to the ground, unless it has the ability to hover or is held aloft by other means.

#### Pulling And Pushing

Some effects such as a roper's Reel bonus action or an ogre using a shove attack can pull or push you away from the source. A creature that has grappled you might also drag you with it during its move.

### Traveling

Traveling is the method of movement used when creatures journey across great distances for long periods of time. When traveling, use travel pace rules to abstract this kind of movement.

#### Travel Pace

While traveling, the party collectively decides if they move at a fast, normal, or slow pace. Consult the Travel Pace table to find how far a group can move in a period of time for their pace, and whether traveling at the pace has any benefits or penalties. For example, a fast pace makes travelers less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully. Note that the Travel Pace table assumes a party is moving through normal terrain. If a party is traveling through difficult terrain, the distance they can travel is halved.

**_Forced March._** A standard travel pace assumes that you travel for 8 hours in a day. You can push beyond that limit at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, you cover the distance shown in the Hour column for your pace, and each character must make a CON save at the end of the hour.

The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed save, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.

**_Mounts and Vehicles._** For short time spans (up to 1 hour), many animals move much faster than Humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace on the table as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel up to 24 hours per day.

##### Table: Travel Pace

Distance traveled per...

| PACE   |   MINUTE |    HOUR |      DAY | EFFECT                         |
| ------ | -------: | ------: | -------: | ------------------------------ |
| Fast   | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles | -5 penalty to Perception score |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles | -                              |
| Slow   | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles | Can use stealth                |

## Interacting With Items

A character's interaction with items in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what happens.

For example, a character pulls a lever. The GM might say that this opens a chute causing a room to flood with water. Or it might open a secret door in a nearby wall.

If the lever is rusted in position though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a STR check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks. The GM determines an object's AC and HP and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks (it's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example). Objects always fail STR and DEX saves, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 HP, it breaks.

A character can also attempt a STR check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.

### Types Of Items

Certain rules, spells, and abilities affect items in different ways. In such scenarios, it's often important to further define the item's type. This section breaks down the various categories of items and provides examples of what kinds of items belong to each.

#### Items

Items is the highest-level category. It includes almost everything that isn't a creature or natural terrain. Items include equipment, objects, structures, and vehicles, and it's a catchall for things that don't fit neatly into another category.

#### Equipment

The equipment category includes all items that can be carried or wielded by characters. Most weapons, armor, adventuring gear, tools, and magic items fall into this category. Typically, equipment doesn't have AC or hit points, and it can't be broken or damaged like other kinds of items.

#### Objects

The object category includes all items that can't be carried or wielded or items. Objects generally have an AC and hit points. Typically, objects can be broken. In many cases, it makes more sense to treat Huge or Gargantuan objects as structures.

#### Structures

The structure category contains items that are massive in scale or composed of many smaller objects. For example, a single wall might be an object, but an entire castle would be a structure. Like objects, most structures can be broken. However, due to their scale, they often possess unique rules around breaking.

#### Vehicles

The vehicle category includes items that are similar in size to structures and composed of many smaller objects. Vehicles specifically have their own vehicle stat block. Vehicles work differently from other items and are governed by their own rules.

### Lifting And Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**_Carrying Capacity._** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.

**_Push, Drag, or Lift._** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**_Size and Strength._** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

#### Variant: Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. For more detailed rules to determine how a character is hindered by carried weight, try this variant. When you use this, ignore the Cumbersome property of armor sets on the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

## Senses

Fundamental adventuring tasks-noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy, and targeting a spell- rely heavily on a character's ability to perceive the world around them.

### Vision And Obscured Areas

Creatures primarily perceive the world by sight. This is called vision. Creatures usually have secondary senses of hearing, smell, and touch that also allow them to interact with the environment, but vision is considered the "standard" primary sense.

Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. Areas of darkness or other effects that interfere with vision are labeled as either lightly or heavily obscured.

#### Lightly Obscured

In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on WIS (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

#### Heavily Obscured

In a heavily obscured area, such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage, a creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area. A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

### Special Senses

In addition to basic vision, creatures can have one or more of the following additional senses.

#### Darkvision

A creature with darkvision can see in darkness. Within darkvision range, the creature can see in dim light as if it were bright light and can see in darkness as if it were dim light. A creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Keensense

A creature with keensense can perceive its surroundings using a sense other than vision. Creatures without eyes typically have this sense, as do creatures with echolocation or an extraordinary sense of smell. If a creature has no other form of sensing, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its keensense defines the maximum range of its ability to perceive the world.

#### Tremorsense

A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the source of vibrations when it and the source are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense typically can't detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

#### Truesight

A creature with truesight can see in dim light, darkness, and magical darkness as if it were bright light. It also sees creatures and objects with the invisible condition, it automatically detects visual illusions and succeed on saves against them, and it perceives the true form of a creature with the Shapechanger tag or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane within truesight range.

## Planes Of Existence

Planes are dimensions governed by distinct laws of physics, magic, and other principles. Planes vary greatly in size and the space they occupy. Some contain hundreds of individual worlds. Some consist of a single continent or are home to one entity. They can exist next to one another or occupy the same space, intersecting or layered atop one another.

Many spells and magic items draw energy from another plane, summon creatures that dwell there, open communication with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. Therefore, most game settings include some model for how the planes are ordered and how creatures travel from plane to plane. The following types of planes are assumed to be included in some capacity.

### The Material Plane

The Material Plane is most similar to our world. Everything in the Material Plane is governed by consistent and measurable principles such as gravity, mortality, and entropy. All fantasy worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. Because it is the default, other planes are defined in relation to the Material Plane.

### Transitive Planes

The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless, primarily serving as ways to travel between planes. Spells such as etherealness and astral projection allow PCs to enter these planes and use them to reach other planes.

The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension. Its edges overlap with the Material Plane (and often other planes). Every location on the Material Plane has a corresponding location in the Ethereal. Because of this overlap, spirits of mortals who die in the Material Plane can become trapped in the Ethereal, wandering the two planes as ghosts or other supernatural entities. Some creatures can see into the Ethereal, and spells like see invisibility and true seeing also grant this ability. Some magic effects like the spells forcecage and wall of force affect space in the Material Plane and its corresponding location in the Ethereal.

The Astral Plane is a realm of thought and dream. It constantly shifts to fill spaces between bordering planes. It resembles a great silvery sea, studded with swirling motes of light that resemble stars. Occasional islands of solid matter coalesce here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless open expanse.

### Other Planes

Planes beyond the Material and Transitive Planes are realms of myth and mystery. They are governed by qualities completely alien to the Material Plane. The types of planes mentioned here go by many different names, but usually appear in fantasy game settings.

- **Celestial Planes.** Celestial creature types are summoned from or banished to these planes. Some celestial planes are ruled by different deities or pantheons. Realms of this type are typically associated with universal forces of good or law.
- **Fiendish Plane.** Fiend creature types are summoned from or banished to these planes. Some fiendish planes are ruled by different categories of Fiend, such as the Hells of devils and the Abysses of demons. Realms of this type are typically associated with universal forces of evil or chaos.
- **Elemental Plane.** Elemental creature types are summoned from or banished to these planes. There are often four separate planes, one associated with each element: air, earth, fire, and water.
- **A Place for the Dead.** When mortals die, their spirits need an otherworldly place to return from when resurrected or contacted. Spirits might go to a celestial or fiendish plane or a land of the dead beyond the Material Plane.
- **A Home for Deities.** Gods, deities, and pantheons usually dwell in a plane and can be contacted there. This could be in one of the previously described planes or their own demiplanes.

### Travel Between Planes

Travel into other planes of existence is a legendary journey to a mythic destination. You can go beyond the Material Plane in two ways: casting a spell or using a planar portal.
**_Spells._** A number of spells open to other planes. Plane shift and gate can transport you directly to any other plane. Etherealness lets you enter the Ethereal Plane. The astral projection spell lets you enter the Astral Plane.

**_Portals._** Portals (sometimes called "gates" or "gateways") are crossing points that allow a creature to travel from one specific location to another specific location on a different plane. Some portals are like doorways, and stepping through (knowingly or unknowingly) activates its travel property. Other portals are distinct locations of their own: circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns that exist in multiple planes at once, transporting all creatures within as they flicker from plane to plane.

## Life And Death

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of a fantasy adventurer.

### Hit Points

Every creature has a number of hit points (HP) representing a combination of its physical and mental durability. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

At full health, a creature is at its hit point maximum. At any given moment, a creature's current hit points can be any number from its hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage and receives healing.

Whenever your character takes damage, subtract that amount from its current hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

#### Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and special abilities give you **temporary hit points**. These are a buffer against damage, an extra pool of hit points that protects your current hit points. When you take damage while you have temporary hit points, subtract the damage amount from the temporary hit points first. Any leftover damage then carries over to your current hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the 5 temporary hit points and then take 2 damage to your current hit points.

Because temporary hit points are separate from your current hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. You can be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.

Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and you can't stack temporary hit points together. If you have a pool of temporary hit points and then get more from another source, decide whether to keep the ones you have or take the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 HP, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. If they absorb all the damage from a hit, you don't have to fail a death save.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a listed duration, they last until depleted or you finish a long rest.

### Damage

The most common type of harm dealt to creatures is represented by damage. Different attacks, spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage.

#### Damage Types

Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. The damage types are provided here, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.

**_Acid._** The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**_Bludgeoning._** Blunt force attacks, such as hammers, falling, and constriction, deal bludgeoning damage.

**_Cold._** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

**_Fire._** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**_Force._** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.

**_Lightning._** A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.

**_Necrotic._** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain Undead and a spell such as grave touch, withers matter and even the soul.

**_Piercing._** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monster bites, deal piercing damage.

**_Poison._** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.

**_Psychic._** Mental abilities or abilities that assault the mind, such as an aboleth's Psychic Bolt or a ghost's Horrify, deal psychic damage.

**_Radiant._** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**_Slashing._** Swords, axes, and claws deal slashing damage.

**_Thunder._** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.

#### Damage Resistance And Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or easy to hurt with certain damage types.

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Rest can restore a creature's hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant. When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid heals a ranger for 8 HP. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains only 6 HP, not 8. A creature that dies can't regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.

#### Hit Dice

Every PC has a number of hit dice equal to their character level. Hit dice are a measure of a character's personal fortitude and allow you to heal yourself without magical assistance during a short rest. The size of your hit dice depends on your class levels. Wizards have a d6, while barbarians have a d12.

#### Resting

Heroic though they might be, adventurers need rest-time to sleep, eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and prepare for further adventure. Adventurers can take short rests during an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

##### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

You can spend one or more hit dice at the end of a short rest, up to your maximum number of hit dice (which is equal to your character's level). For each hit die spent in this way, roll the die, and add your character's CON modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional hit die after each roll until you run out of hit dice. You regain some spent hit dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained in the Long Rest section.

##### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by strenuous activity-at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity-the character must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, you regain all lost hit points up to your hit point maximum. You also regain spent hit dice, up to half of your maximum (minimum of 1). For example, if your character has 8 hit dice, you regain 4 of them upon finishing a long rest.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

### Dropping To 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 HP, you either die outright or fall unconscious and are dying. These rules are primarily used during initiative in an encounter. In rare instances, character death can occur outside of an encounter, especially through dangers covered in the Other Forms of Harm section. The GM decides how these rules function in deadly situations that occur outside of initiative.

#### Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 HP and more damage remains to be taken from that effect, calculate how much damage would remain to be taken, as that roll-over damage might kill you outright. Your character is dead when you are at 0 HP and have either failed three death saves or taken as much damage as your hit point maximum while at 0 HP. Magical healing or a WIS (Medicine) check can't help you at this point. Only a spell like revivify or resurrection can bring the character back to life.

For example, a cleric with a hit point maximum of 12 currently has 6 HP. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 HP, and 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

##### Death Saves

When you start your turn with 0 HP, you must make a special save, called a death save, to determine whether you creep closer to death or cling to life. Unlike other saves, a death save isn't tied to any ability score.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed on the death save. Otherwise, you fail. An individual success or failure has no immediate effect. However, on your third success, you become stable. On your third failure, you die. Successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both resets to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable. Like other saves, Luck can be applied to death saves.

**_Rolling 1 or 20._** When you make a death save and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point and are conscious again, no longer needing to make death saves.

**_Damage at 0 HP._** If you take any damage while you have 0 HP, you suffer an automatic death save failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you die instantly.

#### Dying

If damage reduces you to 0 HP and doesn't kill you, you are dying. Dying is when you are at 0 HP and must make a death save at the start of your next turn. You have the unconscious condition. If you gain hit points while dying, you stop dying. Your unconscious condition ends, but you are still prone.

#### Stable

The best way to help a creature with 0 HP is to heal it. Barring that, the creature can at least be stabilized. You are stable when you are at 0 HP and don't need to make a death save. You still have the unconscious condition. Becoming stable wipes the slate clean of successes and failures on death saves.

You can use your action to try to stabilize a dying creature with a successful DC 10 WIS (Medicine) check. A stable creature remains at 0 HP and is still unconscious, but it doesn't make death saves and is not in imminent danger of death. If the creature takes any damage while stable, it returns to dying and must start making death saves again if it takes any damage.

A stable creature that isn't healed but takes no more damage regains 1 hit point and ends the unconscious condition after 1d4 hours.

#### Monsters And Death

Monsters generally die the instant they drop to 0 HP, since tracking death saves for a dozen monsters can be tedious.

Mighty villains and special NPCs are common exceptions, though. The GM can decide to have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as PCs if it better suits the story.

### Other Forms Of Harm

While damage is the most common form of harm, other effects can bring short-term or long-term harm to PCs.

#### Conditions

Many monster attacks, spells, and other dangers impose
**conditions** on PCs. A condition, such as blinded, charmed, or frightened, can hinder a creature without damaging it. Depending on its source, a condition can last for a few seconds or until a magical cure is found.

Pay special attention to exhaustion-that condition can outright kill a PC and is often inflicted by environmental hazards and other forms of harm.

#### Curses

Curses are supernatural afflictions that magically hamper or alter their victims. Objects, creatures, and even areas can be the target of a curse. Most curses can be ended through use of a remove curse spell, greater restoration spell, or similar magic. Some curses, like those that come with cursed magic items, are only temporarily suppressed by spells like remove curse. The most powerful curses can be broken only by performing specific actions or triggering narrative effects specific to the curse.

#### Diseases

Diseases are physical afflictions that can be contracted from some monsters, hazards, or exposure to necromantic magic. A disease typically ravages its victim over multiple days, causing more damage the longer it is left untreated. While common diseases might be cured with a WIS (Medicine) check, spells like restoration and similar magic are often required to cure more potent diseases.

#### Dread

When PCs witness terrors beyond mortal comprehension, they might be inflicted with dread. Dread goes beyond standard fear. It is severe psychological harm that can scar a creature for minutes or indefinitely until magical intervention is used.

#### Poisons

Poisons are tools used by PCs and monsters to cause harm or injury.

#### Starvation And Dehydration

Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

##### Food

A typical character needs to eat one pound of food per day. You can make food last longer by eating half rations. Eating half rations in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + CON modifier (minimum 1). Beyond that, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of each day they haven't eaten.

One normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

##### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character who drinks even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has at least one level of exhaustion, the character suffers two levels each day with little or no water.

#### Suffocating

Most creatures, particularly most PCs, need to breathe air to survive. When a creature can't breathe, such as while submersed in water, it must hold its breath.

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its CON modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its CON modifier (minimum of 1 round). If it is still out of air at the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 HP and begins making death saves. The creature can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a CON modifier of +2 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 HP.

## Encounter Gameplay

### Rounds And Turns

A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of an encounter, when all participants-PCs and monsters alike-roll initiative to determine initiative order. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

### Determining Initiative Order

**Initiative** determines the order of turns during an encounter. When the GM calls for initiative (typically when an encounter starts), every participant (all involved PCs and NPCs) makes a DEX check (d20 + DEX modifier) to determine their place in the initiative order. If a large group of identical creatures is involved in the encounter, the GM makes one roll for the whole group, so each group member acts at the same time.

Once all participants have rolled, the GM ranks all participants in order from the one with the highest DEX check result to the one with the lowest. This is called
**initiative order**, and the GM follows it to determine when each participant acts during each round. Initiative order remains the same from round to round.

In case of a tie, the GM decides the order among tied NPCs, and the PCs decide among their tied characters. The GM decides the order if the tie is between an NPC and a PC. Optionally, the GM can have tied creatures each roll a d20 with no modifiers to determine the order, highest roll going first.

### Hazards

**Hazards** are location-based threats as opposed to threats presented by creatures (though creatures can create or affect a hazard). Weather conditions can impose hazards like extreme heat or cold, or alter an area's light or obscurement. Ambient magic is also frequently responsible for bizarre and fantastical hazards.

Four of the most common hazards are included here.

#### Extreme Cold

_Hazard_

Exposure to temperatures below 0 degrees Fahrenheit threatens creatures not adapted to the cold. The hazard is generally continual.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature is exposed to extreme cold for at least 1 hour. A creature avoids exposure if it is resistant or immune to cold damage, if it has natural adaptation to cold climates, or it is wearing dry winter clothing such as a heavy coat and furs, gloves, and a hat.

**Effects:** After the first hour, an exposed creature must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or gain one level of exhaustion. The creature must repeat this save at the end of each hour of continued exposure, increasing the DC by 1 for each hour of exposure beyond the first (DC 11 at 2 hours, DC 12 at 3 hours, etc.). Creatures have disadvantage on these saves if they are vulnerable to cold damage, wearing metal armor, wearing clothing not designed for winter conditions, or are wet.

**Resolution:** If an exposed creature is removed from the affected area or otherwise avoids exposure for at least 1 hour, the CON save made against this hazard resets to DC 10. Otherwise, this hazard ends once a creature leaves the affected area or environmental conditions significantly change.

#### Extreme Heat

_Hazard_

Exposure to temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit threatens creatures not adapted to the heat. The hazard is generally continual.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature is exposed to extreme heat for at least 1 hour. A creature avoids exposure if it is resistant or immune to fire damage, if it has natural adaptation to hot climates, or if it has access to twice its daily amount of required drinking water.

**Effects:** After the first hour, an exposed creature must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or gain one level of exhaustion. The creature must repeat this save at the end of each hour of continued exposure, increasing the DC by 1 for each hour of exposure beyond the first (DC 11 at 2 hours, DC 12 at 3 hours, etc.). Creatures have disadvantage on these saves if they are vulnerable to fire damage, wearing metal armor or Heavy armor, or wearing clothing not designed for hot climates.

**Resolution:** If an exposed creature is removed from the affected area or otherwise avoids exposure for at least 1 hour, the CON save made against this hazard resets to DC 10. Otherwise, this hazard ends once a creature leaves the affected area or environmental conditions significantly change.

#### Gale Winds

_Hazard_

Heavy gusting winds can appear with little warning, battering the weak and impairing many activities. Gale winds disperse fog, extinguish open flames, and make movement difficult for small and flying creatures. As a weather hazard, it is usually only minutes long, though in canyons or mountainous regions, it can be continual.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature enters an area affected by gale winds.

**Effects:** Gale winds impose disadvantage on ranged attacks and WIS (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Small and Tiny creatures must succeed on a DC 11 STR save or fall prone at the start of each of their turns while in the area. A flying creature must land at the end of each turn spent in the area or make a DC 11 STR save. On a failure, the creature falls to the ground instantly and takes falling damage.

**Resolution:** An affected creature must find shelter or leave the area.

#### Torrential Precipitation

_Hazard_

Precipitation such as heavy rain or snowfall causes a variety of problems. It can last from minutes to days.

**Trigger:** This hazard begins when a creature enters an area affected by torrential precipitation.

**Effects:** Everything within the area is considered lightly obscured. A creature that starts its turn within torrential precipitation has disadvantage on WIS (Perception) checks. If the torrential precipitation is heavy rain, it extinguishes open flame. If it is heavy snowfall, the ground is difficult terrain.

**Resolution:** An affected creature must find shelter or leave the area.

### Traps

Traps can be almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on unwary travelers. Detecting and disarming traps are your best defense against these troubles.

#### Trap Types

A trap can be either mechanical or magical. Either kind can also be complex.

##### Mechanical Traps

Mechanical traps include things that depend on a mechanism to operate, such as pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, and whirling blades.

##### Magic Traps

Magic traps consist of magical devices that activate spell effects. Spells like glyph of warding and symbol function as magic traps.

##### Complex Traps

Complex traps continue to execute on rounds after activation instead of triggering once and being done. For example, a trap that slowly floods a room is a complex trap. On the trap's turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.

Complex traps can start initiative and act independently in initiative order. On each of its turns, the trap takes an action, usually making successive attacks or maintaining an effect that changes over time. Until triggered, a complex trap can be detected and disabled like a standard trap.

#### Detecting Traps

Every trap in the game has a specific way it can be detected, but a trap usually requires a PC to actively spot it with a WIS (Perception) check against the trap's DC (set by the GM). Some basic traps can be automatically spotted with a high enough passive Perception score, but the deadliest traps often are hidden too well for passive detection. Your group's travel pace can also reduce your ability to passively spot hidden dangers.

#### Disarm Traps

If a PC detects a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it. Every trap has a specific way it can be disarmed (or avoided), but typically, disarming a trap requires a PC to succeed on a DEX (Thieves Tools) check against the trap's DC (set by the GM). Complex traps might first require a successful INT (Investigation) check just to deduce the trap's operation. Some magical traps require an INT (Arcana) check to detect or disarm and might even require a spell like dispel magic to disarm instead of thieves' tools.

## Combat Encounters

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes this chaos into a cycle of rounds and turns.

A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when all participants-PCs and monsters alike-roll initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, if neither side has won, a new round begins.

### Combat Steps

The basic steps of combat are detailed here.

#### 1. Determine Surprise

When a combat encounter begins, but before initiative is rolled, the GM determines whether any participants might be surprised and get the surprised condition. If no participants are trying to be stealthy, everyone notices each other and no one is surprised.

Otherwise, the GM compares the DEX (Stealth) checks of any creatures actively hiding at the start of combat with the passive Perception score (for PCs) or Perception score (for NPCs or monsters) of creatures on the opposing side. Individual members of a group can be surprised even if other members aren't.

Some hazards, traps, and other environmental effects can also cause surprise when triggered. If an effect has this ability, its relevant DCs are listed in the description.

#### 2. Establish Positions

The GM decides where all the PCs and adversaries are located at the start of the combat encounter based on player descriptions and story events.

Typically, a GM places all creatures involved in combat on a physical or virtual map, to give players an idea of where they can move during their turns. Even during theater of the mind combat with no map, participants take up the same amount of space and move as they would on a map divided into squares where each square represents a 5-by-5foot space.

##### Space

A standard space covers a 5-by-5-foot square. A space is the area in feet that a creature effectively controls in combat, not just an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but in a fight, it controls that amount of space. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively, which limits the number of creatures that can surround one target in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit around one target.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a target. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller creature, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

##### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size can control in combat.

###### Table: Size Categories

| SIZE       | SPACE                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Tiny       | 2Â½ by 2Â½ ft. (one-quarter of a space) |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft. (one space)                |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft. (one space)                |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft. (4 spaces)               |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft. (9 spaces)               |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger (16 spaces)    |

#### 3. Roll Initiative

Combat encounters use the initiative system described in the Determining Initiative Order.

#### 4. Take Your Turn

On your turn in combat, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first.

##### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take a bonus action on your turn in addition to your normal action and movement. A **bonus action** is an extra ability to act that you only get to take in special circumstances. You can only ever take one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when more than one is available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to take an action, such as the incapacitated condition, also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

##### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a reaction. A **reaction** is an instant response to a trigger (specified in the reaction's description), which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction.

You can take only one reaction until the start of your next turn. If a reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn after the effects of the reaction are resolved.

##### Other Activity On Your Turn

You can accomplish a variety of minor things during your turn that don't interfere with your normal action and movement. Here are the kinds of things you might be able to accomplish in this way:

- You can communicate at any time (even on someone else's turn) through brief talking and gestures.
- You can interact with one object or aspect of the environment for free, during your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move, draw your weapon as part of your Attack action, or stow a shield as part of a Ready action.
- If you want to interact with a second object, you must commit your action to it with the Use an Object action.
- Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions. The GM might require you to use an action for any activity that needs special care or presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

### Movement In Combat

#### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some speed before and then the remainder after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

#### Moving Between Attacks

If your action includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement by moving between attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Multiattack feature and has a speed of 30 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 20 feet, and then attack a different target.

#### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as a walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch between them during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the _fly_ spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet. If you wanted to walk any farther, you'd be done for your move, but you could still leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

#### Difficult Terrain

Areas of difficult terrain hamper movement. In addition, during combat encounters, any space occupied by another creature (hostile or not), also counts as difficult terrain.

#### Falling Prone And Standing Up

Combatants often get knocked down or throw themselves down. This condition is called prone.

You can choose to **fall prone on your turn freely**, without using any speed. **Standing up** from prone costs half your speed for the turn. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can be your entire move. However you move, deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

#### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. You can only move through a hostile creature's space if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.

Regardless of attitude, you can't willingly end your move in another creature's space.

If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack.

#### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who flees or passes by. Such a strike is called an **opportunity attack**.

A creature (PC or monster) can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature it can see moves out of its reach. To make the opportunity attack, use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The opportunity attack triggers as the creature leaves your reach, so you resolve your attack before it finishes its movement.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when movement is forced. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach, you are shoved by a hostile creature, or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

### Actions In Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here or an action gained from your class or some other feature. Monsters have distinct actions listed in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success.

#### Attack

The most common action in combat is the Attack action, whether you swing a sword, fire an arrow from a bow, or brawl with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. Certain features, such as the fighter's Multiattack, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

#### Cast A Spell

Spellcasting characters, such as clerics and wizards, can take the Cast a Spell action to cast a spell in combat. You can only cast spells this way if the spell has a casting time of 1 action. If a spell's casting time is longer than an action (minutes or hours), a bonus action or a reaction, you can't take this action to cast it.

#### Dash

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for this turn. Move up to your speed, effectively doubling your movement for your turn. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you take the Dash action.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. For instance, if your normal speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet on your turn with a Dash.

#### Disengage

When you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

#### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, you make DEX saves with advantage and attack rolls made against you have disadvantage if you can see the attacker. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or suffer a similar penalty that reduces your speed to 0.

#### Help

The Help action lets you aid a creature to complete a task. That creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

You can also take the Help action to aid a friendly creature attack a target within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or otherwise team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, they get advantage on their first attack roll.

#### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a DEX (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding.

#### Ready

When you take the Ready action, you prepare to do something on another creature's turn using your reaction. This lets you get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. You must take your readied reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, name a perceivable circumstance that triggers your reaction. Then, state the action or move you plan to take in response to that trigger. Examples include, "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

You can ready a spell with the Ready action. You cast it as normal but hold its energy. Then, after the trigger, you release it with your reaction.

To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding the energy requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends. Furthermore, if you take damage before you release the readied magic missile, your concentration might be broken.

#### Search

The Search action lets you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a WIS (Perception) check or an INT (Investigation) check.

#### Use An Object

When you take the Use an Object action, you focus specifically on that interaction. Since you can normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as drawing a sword as part of an attack, this action is usually only needed when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. If an object is complex or requires an ability check to use, the GM might require this action even if it's the only object you've handled this turn.

### Making An Attack

When you use the Attack action in combat to make an attack, you typically make an attack roll to hit your target. Your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the check result equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. If your attack roll is successful, you deal damage or achieve the goal of your attack.

Various rules factor into determining the success or failure of attack rolls and the effectiveness of damage. These rules are described in this section.

#### 1. Declare Attack Type & Target

To make an attack, first choose the type of attack you intend to make: a melee attack or a ranged attack. You then choose a target (or targets) within reach or range of the kind of attack you want to make.

If you are using the Cast a Spell action, the spell's description states if the spell is a melee or ranged attack.

##### Melee Attack

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, warhammer, or axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, or teeth.

**_Reach._** You can make melee attacks only against targets within a specified reach. Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

##### Ranged Attack

When you make a ranged attack, you might fire a bow, hurl a handaxe, or send projectiles to strike at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

**_Range._** You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.

**_Long Range._** Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is at long range, and you can't attack a target beyond long range.

**_Close Range._** Making a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.

#### 2. Determine Modifiers

When a PC makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus (PB). When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses the modifier provided for the action in its stat block.

Other factors can help an attack roll succeed, such as those granted by various class features. Environmental factors, cover, or attempting to attack an invisible target make attack rolls more difficult.

##### Ability Modifier

The ability modifier for a melee weapon attack is STR, and the ability modifier for a ranged weapon attack is DEX. Weapons with the Finesse or Thrown property break this rule.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

##### Proficiency Bonus

Add your proficiency bonus (PB) to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency and any time you attack with a spell.

##### Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target benefits from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective cover applies. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, friendly or hostile.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and DEX saves. A target has three-quarters cover if three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach a target with total cover by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

##### Unseen Attackers And Targets

Combatants can try to escape notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing at the target's location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, though the GM might just say that you missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden-both unseen and unheard-when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

#### 3. Make An Attack Roll

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the check result equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.

##### Critical Miss Or Critical Hit

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a **critical hit**. Critical hits also allow you to deal extra damage.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack is a **critical miss**, and it misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.

#### 4. Resolve The Attack

If your attack roll failed to hit the target, the attack is over and you play out the rest of your turn (or make your next attack if you have a class feature like Multiattack). If your attack roll was a success, you hit! Roll the damage listed in the attack unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

##### Damage Rolls And Modifiers

If you successfully hit with an attack roll, you deal the attack's damage. Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. A penalty might cause you to deal 0 damage, but you never deal negative damage.

When attacking with a weapon, add your ability modifier (the same one used for the attack roll) to the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball, the player rolls damage once for all creatures caught in the blast.

##### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit (you roll a 20 on the attack roll die), you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, roll those dice twice as well.

### Melee Attacks

This section describes the rules and types of melee attacks.

#### Reach

Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

#### Melee Weapon Attacks

Most melee attacks are melee weapon attacks. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part-these kind of attacks are also considered melee weapon attacks.

##### Unarmed Strikes

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar forceful blow. Although this is still a melee weapon attack, an unarmed strike doesn't count as a weapon and the damage dealt can't be modified by effects that increase weapon dice. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your STR modifier. You are always considered proficient with your unarmed strikes.

#### Melee Spell Attacks

Some spells are considered melee attacks and are called melee spell attacks. Typically, these spells have a range of touch. If a spell requires you to make a melee spell attack, it is noted in the spell description.

#### Special Melee Attacks

A melee attack usually involves an attack roll and dealing damage. However, you can try a special melee attack option instead of a standard melee attack.

##### Grappling

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to grapple a creature, potentially imposing the grappled condition. If you can make multiple attacks with the Attack action, a grapple attack can replace one.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll. Make a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target's STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (target chooses).

If you win the contest, the target takes no damage but has the grappled condition. The condition specifies what ends it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**_Escaping a Grapple._** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (it chooses) contested by your STR (Athletics) check.

**_Moving a Grappled Creature._** When you move, you can drag or carry a grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

##### Shoving

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you can make multiple attacks with the Attack action, a shove attack can replace one. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within your reach. Instead of an attack roll, you make a STR (Athletics) check contested by the target's STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) check (target chooses). If you win the contest, you knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

##### Two Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a Light melee weapon you are wielding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different Light melee weapon you are wielding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either Light weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon instead of making a melee attack with it.

##### Weapon Options

Weapon Options available for melee weapons are also considered special melee attacks. When using the Attack action, you can use a weapon option as a special melee attack. If you can make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack can replace one.

### Ranged Attacks

This section describes the rules and types of ranged attacks.

#### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.

##### Long Range

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is in long range, and you can't attack a target beyond long range.

##### Close Range

Making a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.

#### Ranged Weapon Attacks

Many ranged attacks are ranged weapon attacks. A ranged attack typically uses a weapon that fires ammunition via the Ammunition property, such as a bow, sling, or crossbow. Weapons with the Thrown property can also be used for ranged weapon attacks.

#### Ranged Spell Attacks

The majority of spells that require a spellcaster to make an attack are ranged spell attacks. If a spell requires you to make a ranged spell attack, it is noted in the spell description.

#### Weapon Options

Weapon Options available for use with ranged weapons are considered special ranged attacks. When using the Attack action, you can use a weapon option as a special ranged attack. If you can make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack can replace one.

### Special Combat Rules

This section covers rules for unusual combat situations.

#### Mounted Combat

A willing creature at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, granting you use of their speed and mobility.

##### Mounting And Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you, or you can dismount. This costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. You can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same save with the same results.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount and land on your feet as it falls. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet of it.

##### Controlling A Mount

While you're mounted, you can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, generally prefer to act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to devour a downed foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

#### Underwater Combat

Fighting underwater is a challenging environment with special rules to represent that challenge.

When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on attack rolls unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** can't hit a target beyond its normal range. The attack roll has disadvantage even within normal range unless the weapon is a crossbow, net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (such as a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.

## Between Adventures

### Carousing

**_Time._** To carouse, a PC must spend at least one week of downtime attending social events and gatherings in a city or other densely populated area.

**_Cost._** Carousing requires a PC to spend money based on the class of individuals they want to carouse with: lower class, middle class, or upper class. Carousing with the upper class costs more than carousing with the lower class due to the higher cost of events, clothing, and food enjoyed by the wealthy.

Select one of the following options or ask your GM to select based on the kind of people you wish to carouse with. Note that if more than one PC engages in the same carousing activity, the cost must be paid for each participant, but only one PC must expend the required downtime. Listed costs cover an entire week of carousing.

- **_Lower Class (10 gp)._** This type of carousing is for nights of drinking at a favorite tavern, outdoor concerts and fairs, and late-night loitering. Members of the lower class typically include students, servants, laborers, petty criminals, soldiers, acolytes, and sailors.
- **_Middle Class (50 gp)._** This type of carousing is for pub crawls, concerts and plays, and similar ticketed activities. Members of the middle class typically include business owners, skilled tradespeople, professors, scholars, and military officers.
- **_Upper Class (250 gp)._** This type of carousing is for invitation-only soirees, hobnobbing with nobility, lavish consecutive dinners out, and other costly endeavors. Members of the upper class typically include nobles, celebrities, high priests, archmages, crime bosses, and generals.

**_Resolution._** After each week spent carousing, a PC makes a CHA (Persuasion) check or a similarly relevant ability check to determine if they made any contacts or gained any favors, as shown on the Carousing Resolution table.

#### Table: Carousing Resolution

| CHECK RESULT | RESOLUTION                                                                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         01-05 | Lose a contact or a favor owed by an existing contact.                                                   |
|        06-10 | Make no new contacts and gain no favors.                                                                 |
|        11-15 | Make one new contact or gain one favor with an existing contact.                                         |
|        16-20 | Make two new contacts or gain two favors with existing contacts (or one of each).                        |
|          21+ | Make three new contacts or gain three favors with existing contacts (or a combination of those options). |

### Using Contacts And Favors

Making a _contact_ via carousing represents time spent building a bond with a specific NPC. When a new contact is gained, the GM and PC can work together to decide if they made a contact of a suitable NPC previously encountered in the game, a new distinct NPC that needs a name and personality, or if an NPC's function is needed more than a person, such as "city guard" or "spice merchant."

Contacts can be called on to help PCs by performing favors for them. A new contact automatically owes the PC one favor. After a PC has made at least one contact by carousing, future carousing successes can be used to gain new contacts or accrue favors with existing contacts.

In general, favors can be called in to accomplish tasks that don't put contacts at risk of harm or betray their nature. For example, a favor likely can't be called in to make a contact fight for you, but a favor could be called in to have a contact find a talented mercenary willing to work for you at a discounted rate.

The type of favors a contact can perform depend on which economic class they belong to. Suggestions of favors appropriate for each category are given in the Favors by Status table, but the GM has final say on what a particular contact can accomplish.

#### Table: Favors By Status

| STATUS       | SUGGESTED FAVORS                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lower Class  | Track the comings and goings of an employer or other specific person for up to a week. Ensure a particular door or window is left unlocked. Discretely deliver a message or package.                                             |
| Middle Class | Find a supplier selling materials or equipment at a discounted rate. Provide your party with free food and accommodations for up to a week. Agree to become your regular instructor (see the Training activity in this section). |
| Upper Class  | Get an invitation for you to an exclusive party or event. Connect you with someone willing to buy or sell rare goods or magic items. Lend you a substantial amount of money (to be paid back at a later date).                   |

### Crafting

**_Time._** Your progress toward crafting items is measured in days of downtime. For each workday spent crafting, you can craft one item worth 10 gp or multiple items worth a combined total of 10 gp. If something you want to craft is worth more than that, you can spend multiple days of downtime working to complete the item, making 10 gp worth of progress each day, until it is completed. You don't need to work consecutive days to make progress, but the GM might rule you need to start over if long periods of time pass without resuming work on the same item.

More than one character can work together to craft an item more quickly, as long as they are also proficient with the relevant tools and have access to the appropriate materials. The GM has final say on how many characters can work on a single item at once. A large project, such as building a cart, might offer plenty of room for characters to work together while a belt might be small enough that only one character can work on it at a time.

**_Cost._** Crafting items requires a PC to spend money on materials necessary to make them. To craft an item, a PC must purchase materials equal to half the cost of the item's listed value.

**_Resolution._** Once all required components and tools are in hand and downtime is spent, the item is successfully crafted.

### Researching

**_Time._** To conduct research, a PC must spend at least one week of downtime reading, studying, attending lectures, or conducting interviews where multiple sources of relevant information are found.

**_Cost._** Each week of downtime you spend researching, you must spend at least 50 gp to cover expenses, or more if the GM rules the information you seek is difficult to find. This cost represents materials purchased, palms greased to gain access, donations required to access public records, and similar expenses.

**_Resolution._** At the end of each week spent researching, a PC makes an INT (Arcana), INT (History), INT (Nature), INT (Religion) check (or a similarly relevant ability check) to determine whether they learned any clues about the topic of their research, as shown on the Researching Resolution table.

#### Table: Researching Resolution

| CHECK RESULT | RESOLUTION                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        01-05 | Learn an incorrect "clue." You believe it to be true or lose an unused clue. |

#### Using Clues

A clue is a secret or otherwise valuable piece of information regarding the subject of your research. When you gain a new clue, you can spend it immediately to have the GM give one true (and useful) fact about the research topic you discussed with and GM when you began the research downtime activity.

Alternatively, you can hold a clue to spend at a later time. A held clue can be used to automatically succeed on a future INT-based ability check made to learn about the research topic.

A clue is a concise, specific, and true fact about a creature, place, historical event, or item. The best clues provide helpful hints, warnings, or leads relevant to the story. The **Sample Clues** table contains some suggested clues.

### Training

**_Time._** Training typically requires at least 50 weeks before mastering a new proficiency or talent, but the GM can increase or decrease this number as makes sense for the pace and story of a campaign. Successful resolution checks can dramatically shorten this time.

**_Cost._** A PC must pay an instructor at least 1 gp per week to receive their tutelage, unless the GM determines that the instructor requires a higher amount. Some instructors, especially those gained through carousing, might require a student to regularly perform tasks for them in addition to paying money.

**_Resolution._** At the end of each week spent training, a PC rolls a d20 and adds their PB to determine the result of their training as shown on the **Training Resolution** table. Luck can be spent 1-for-1 to increase the result of this roll, but Luck can't be used to grant advantage on the roll and no other features can modify it. Once the full time and cost are spent, your character learns the new feature.

| CHECK RESULT | RESOLUTION                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|        01â€“05 | Lose a week of progress toward your goal or you lose your instructor and you must find another one before you can continue training (playerâ€™s choice). |
|        06â€“10 | Make one week of progress toward your goal.                                                                                                            |
|        11â€“15 | Make two weeks of progress toward your goal.                                                                                                           |
|        16â€“20 | Make three weeks of progress toward your goal, or a number of weeks of progress equal to your PB (whichever is higher).                                |
|          21+ | Halve the total number of remaining weeks needed to meet your goal (to a minimum of 1 week remaining).                                                 |

### Working

**_Time._** To work, a PC must spend at least one week of downtime.

**_Resolution._** At the end of a week spent working, the PC makes a single ability check using a skill or tool that the PC and GM agree is most relevant to the type of work performed. The result of the check determines how much money the PC earned for the week, as shown on the **Working Resolution** table. Monetary values assume a standard economy in a typical fantasy setting, but the GM should feel free to adjust these values as suits the needs of the game.

#### Table: Working Resolution

| CHECK RESULT | RESOLUTION                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01â€“05        | You earn 10 sp for the week                                 |
| 06â€“10        | You earn 5 gp for the week                                  |

| 16â€“20        | You earn 20 gp for the week                                 |
| 21+          | You earn 20 gp for the week + bonus gp equal to your PB Ã— 5 |
