## Talents

### Magic Talents

#### Arcanist

_Prerequisite: Spellcasting Class Feature_

Your focus on magical studies yielded incredible results, granting these benefits:

- Double your PB for any ability check you make that uses the Arcana skill.
- You can replace one cantrip or spell that you know (not a spell in a spellbook) with a different cantrip or spell of the same circle from your Spellcasting feature's source list. The spell must be of a circle you can cast.
- You learn one additional cantrip from your Spellcasting feature's source list.

#### Combat Casting

Experience on the battlefield has given you superior focus to cast your spells. You gain these benefits:

- When you make a CON save to maintain concentration on a spell, treat any d20 roll of 7 or less as though you rolled an 8.
- When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a cantrip instead of making a melee attack.
- You can use a shield or weapon you wield as a spellcasting focus. As normal, you can use the same hand or hands holding this focus to perform somatic spell components.

#### Elemental Savant

_Prerequisite: Ability to Cast at Least One Spell that Deals Damage_

Choose one of the following elemental damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can convert the damage type of that spell to your chosen elemental damage type. You must decide to convert the damage type when you declare you are casting the spell.

In addition, when you roll damage for a spell that naturally uses your chosen elemental damage type-not a spell you convert to your chosen type-you can reroll any damage dice results of 1. You must keep the new result.

You can select this talent multiple times, selecting a different damage type each time.

#### Mental Fortitude

Through rigid mental exercise, you have fortified yourself against mind-altering effects. You gain these benefits:

- Once per short rest, when you fail an INT, WIS, or CHA save, you can choose to reroll the save and take the new result.
- When you start your turn charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, you gain 1 Luck.

#### Psycanist

_Prerequisite: INT 13 or Higher_

Through magic, you learned to influence and manipulate the world around you with your mind. You gain one of the following benefits:

- You can telepathically speak with any creature within 30 feet of you. A creature doesn't need to share a language with you to communicate this way, but it must understand at least one language. Creatures you speak to can reply to you telepathically, but can't initiate a telepathic conversation.
- As a bonus action, you can read the aura of a single creature that you can see within 30 feet of you until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the target isn't invisible or heavily obscured to you. You know its current hit points, its resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities, and learn the creature's emotional state, including whether it is hostile or docile.
- As a bonus action, you can attempt to lift, push, pull, or shove one Medium or smaller creature or object (up to 200 pounds) that you can see within 30 feet of you. A creature that succeeds on a STR save against your spell save DC [DC is equal to 8 + your INT modifier + your PB if you don't have a spell save DC] is unaffected. On a failed save, the creature or object is pulled, pushed, or lifted 5 feet in the direction of your choice.

You can select this talent multiple times, choosing a different benefit each time.

#### Ritualist

_Prerequisite: Spellcasting Class Feature_

Your study of magic has unlocked the mysteries of ritual spells. When you gain this talent, you also gain a ritual book, which contains the rituals you know. To cast a ritual spell, you must have your ritual book in hand.

Choose a spell source: Arcane, Divine, Primordial, or Wyrd. You must choose your rituals from that source's spell list. Regardless of which source you choose, you use your normal spellcasting ability for these spells.

When you gain your ritual book, add one ritual of each spell circle you have already unlocked via your spellcasting class. For example, a cleric who selects this talent at 4th level has spell slots for 1st and 2nd circles, so they would add one 1st-circle ritual and one 2nd-circle ritual to their book.

Each time you gain access to a new circle of spell slots by gaining a level in your spellcasting class, add one new ritual spell to your book. This new ritual must be from the same source of magic you originally chose, and it must be of a circle for which you have spell slots. For example, when a cleric reaches 5th level, they gain access to 3rd-circle spells, so the cleric would select one ritual spell of 3rd circle or lower to add to their ritual book.

You can select this talent multiple times, choosing a different source of magic each time.

#### School Specialization

Choose one of the eight schools of magic: abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or transmutation. You gain these benefits:

- When you cast spells of your chosen school, your spell attack bonus and spell save DC are both increased by 1.
- If you use a spellbook to cast your spells, the gold and time you must spend copying a spell of that school into your spellbook is halved.
- When you spend two or more sorcery points while casting a spell of that school, you regain 1 sorcery point at the end of your turn.

You can select this talent multiple times, selecting a different school of magic each time.

#### Furious Charge
