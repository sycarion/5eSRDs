While it has 0 Hit Points in mist form, it can't return to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.

While in bat form, the vampire can't speak. Its game statistics, other than its size and Speed, are unchanged.
While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless and can enter an enemy's space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, the mist can do so, but it can't pass through liquid. It has Resistance to all damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.

***Charm (Recharge 5-6).*** The vampire casts *Charm Person*, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17), and the duration is 24 hours.
