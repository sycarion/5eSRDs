# Creature Type

Every creature, including every player character, has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. These are the game's creature types:

|            |           |             |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Aberration | Elemental | Monstrosity |
| Beast      | Fey       | Ooze        |
| Celestial  | Fiend     | Plant       |
| Construct  | Giant     | Undead      |
| Dragon     | Humanoid  |             |

The types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.
