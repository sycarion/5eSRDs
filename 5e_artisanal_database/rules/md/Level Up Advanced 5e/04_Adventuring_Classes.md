die.]

When your unarmed strike reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you can
spend 3 exertion to utterly destroy the target's body and soul. The
target can't be restored to life by any means short of a [wish
]spell.

[When you hit a creature with two or more unarmed strikes in the same
turn, you can spend 3 exertion to force it to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the target suffers one effect you choose from
the list below. For each successful unarmed strike after the second, you
can spend 1 exertion to deal one additional effect. For example, if you
hit with four unarmed attacks, you can spend 5 exertion to deal three
effects. You can't choose the same effect more than once, and a
successful saving throw negates all effects.]

-   [The target takes extra damage equal to twice your martial arts
    die.]
-   The target is blinded and deafened for 1 minute.
-   [The target is paralyzed for 1 minute. At the start of each of its
    turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
    a success.]
-   [The target is knocked prone and becomes poisoned for 1 minute.]{.c6
    .c17}
-   [Features, spells, and traits that would restore the target's hit
    points have no effect on the target until the start of your next
    turn.]
-   [The target loses a spell slot from its highest available
    level.]
-   The target loses 6 exertion.
-   [The target can't use bonus actions, legendary actions, or reactions
    until the start of your next turn.]
-   The target gains a level of fatigue.

|                                   | damage, and it dies if it fails   |

shortswords]

Tools:[ Two musical instruments of your choice, or one musical
instrument and any other tool]

Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma

Skills: Choose any three

## Equipment 

[You begin the game with 135 gp. You can select your own gear or choose
one of the following equipment packages. Also consult the Suggested
Equipment section of your chosen background.]

-   Agitator's Set (Cost 111 gp):[ Dagger, hand crossbow and
    quiver with 20 bolts, padded cloth, entertainer's pack, flute]{.c6
    .c17}
-   Ambassador's Set (Cost 91 gp):[ Longsword, shortbow with 20
    arrows, padded leather, diplomat's pack, violin]

## Art Speciality 

[Starting at 1st level, any musical instrument that you have proficiency
with counts as a spell focus for the purposes of spellcasting. Although
spells can be cast without these instruments, only targets that are able
to perceive your performance can benefit from this feature. Whenever you
finish a rest, choose one of the following as your Art Specialty.]{.c6
.c17}

Percussion (Casabas, Castanets, Drums, Maracas).[ Any instrument
played by being struck or scraped (either by other instruments or
against each other) qualifies as a percussion instrument. When you cast
a bard spell from the sound school using a percussion instrument as your
spell focus, double the spell\'s range. A sound spell that has a range
of Touch increases its range to 30 feet.]

String Instruments (Dulcimer, Harp, Lute, Lyre, Violin).[ String
instruments are played by plucking and twanging strings. When using a
string instrument as a spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell from
the movement or teleportation school, you can target an additional
creature within 15 feet of you.]

Visual (Calligraphy, Dance, Light Manipulation, Shapes).[ There
are many ways to undertake a visual performance, whether through
illustration, illusion magic, or legerdemain. When using visual art as a
spell focus, whenever you cast a bard spell, you can make one ally that
can see you the point of origin of that spell. You must be able to see
any targets of the spell.]

Voice (Humming, Insults, Oration, Singing).[ When using this
musical art as a spell focus, you have advantage on checks made to
maintain concentration on a bard spell.]

[Wind Instruments (Bagpipes, Flute, Horn, Ocarina,
Trombone).][ Any instrument played by passing air through it
qualifies as a wind instrument. When you cast a bard spell using a wind
instrument as a spell focus, you can make a Deception or Performance
check as a part of casting the spell. Creatures with a passive Insight
score equal to or less than the result of your check do not see or hear
you cast the spell. Once you have used this feature three times, you
can't do so again until you finish a long rest.]

## Bardic Inspiration 

[A number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once) per
long rest, you can use a bonus action to choose one creature other than
yourself within 60 feet that can hear or see you. That creature gains a
d6 Bardic Inspiration die.]

[Within the next 10 minutes, before or after rolling an ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw (but before the result is determined), the
creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled
to the result. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is
expended. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a
time.]

[At 5th level, your Bardic Inspiration die increases to a d8. At 10th
level it increases to a d10, and at 15th level it increases to a
d12.]

## Battle Hymn 

[At 1st level, you learn a battle hymn, which can be expressed in any
type of performance. Once at the start of your turn, you can activate a
battle hymn by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action
is required). Performing a battle hymn requires your concentration, as
though you were casting a spell. Once activated, a battle hymn continues
until you lose concentration or the start of your next turn.]

[The number of battle hymns you know are listed in the Battle Hymns
Known column of the Bard table. Whenever you gain a bard level, you may
choose one battle hymn you know and replace it with a new battle hymn.
Your bard level determines what battle hymns you can learn.]

Audience.[ Unless otherwise noted, a battle hymn does not have a
target until you choose one, and each hymn targets a single creature
within 30 feet. You can choose to target a creature at any time, but
once you have chosen a target of your battle hymn, the hymn's target
can't be changed.]

Sustained Song.[ When you have an activated battle hymn but have
not chosen a creature to benefit from it yet, at the start of your turn
when it would end you can instead choose to sustain the battle hymn
until the start of your next turn without expending a use of Bardic
Inspiration.]

## Spellcasting 

### Cantrips 

You learn two bard cantrips of your choice at 1st level and additional
bard cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
the Bard Spells table.

### Spell Slots 

[To cast a bard spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level
or higher. The Bard Spells table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your bard spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.]

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher 

[At 1st level, you know your choice of four 1st-level spells from the
bard spell list. Consult the Spells Known column of the Bard Spells
table to see when you can choose more bard spells. Each of these spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. ]

Additionally, when you gain a bard level, you can replace a bard spell
you know with another from the bard spell list, provided it is of a
level for which you have spell slots.

### Ritual Casting 

[You can cast a bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell can be
cast as a ritual.]

### Spellcasting Ability 

[Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. You use
your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier to set the attack bonus and
saving throw DC for your bard spells, as follows:]

Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier]

Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier]

### Spellcasting Focus 

[When casting a bard spell, you can use an arcane focus or Art
Speciality as your spellcasting focus.]

## Adventuring Tricks 

[At 2nd level, you learn one adventuring trick of your choice.
Adventuring tricks are detailed at the end of the class description. The
Tricks Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more
adventuring tricks.]

## Jack-of-All-Trades 

[Starting at 2nd Level, if you are not proficient with a skill or tool,
you can add half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to ability checks
using that skill or tool.]

## Varied Expertise 

[Also at 2nd level, you gain an expertise die on one skill or tool of
your choice. At 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, choose an additional
skill or tool.]

## Bard Archetype 

[At 3rd level, choose a bard archetype. Your archetype grants you
features at 3rd, 6th, and 14th level.]

## Ability Score Improvement 

[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]

## Bardic Legend 

[At 4th level, you write a bardic tale of your adventures. Your bardic
legend takes whatever form you like. When you enter a settlement and
spend a day playing or recounting the tale, the reputation of you and
your allies starts to grow. In addition to receiving local quests suited
to the exploits detailed in your bardic legend, when you rest in a
settlement that knows your bardic legend, you and your allies regain all
spent hit dice over the course of a long rest. In addition, you gain an
expertise die on Prestige checks made in the settlement.]

[Starting at 7th level, you craft a second bardic legend. Commoners are
either more amenable or afraid of you, depending on the type of bardic
legend you create. Choose one of the following skills: Deception,
Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. You gain advantage on checks made
using the chosen skill to influence any commoner that has heard your
bardic legend.]

[Beginning at 11th level, whenever you enter a settlement, you can name
a new bardic legend of your choice. Allies that are part of the tale
gain inspiration when they finish a long rest in that settlement. Any
other creatures that are part of that tale have their reputations
ruined---either they confront you directly to stop the rumor, or they
are unable to hide or deal in that town for the length of time you are
in it. Once you have used this feature in a settlement, you can't do so
again until you finish a long rest.]

## Battle Hymn Focus 

[Also at 4th level, at the end of another creature's turn, you can use
your reaction to activate a battle hymn. This battle hymn replaces any
currently activated battle hymns. Replacing an activated battle hymn
does not require expending a use of Bardic Inspiration if the previously
activated hymn doesn't have a target.]

In addition, choose one of the following.

-   Your battle hymns don't require concentration.
-   [Your battle hymns can affect a number of additional creatures equal
    to your Charisma modifier (minimum one).]
-   [You learn an additional battle hymn, which doesn't count against
    the number of battle hymns you know. When choosing this battle hymn,
    treat your bard level as four higher for the purposes of meeting the
    hymn's prerequisites. If you change this Battle Hymn Focus, you
    forget the additional battle hymn.]

[Whenever you gain a bard level, you can change your Battle Hymn
Focus.]

## Renewed Inspiration 

[Starting at 5th level, you regain all expended uses of Bardic
Inspiration whenever you finish a rest.]

## Key Change 

[Also at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to change your Art
Speciality. Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until
you finish a rest.]

## Prestigious 

[Beginning at 6th level, your Prestige rating increases by an amount
equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). When you reach 11th
level, your Prestige rating instead increases by an amount equal to your
proficiency bonus.]

## Maestro 

[At 7th level, choose one Art Speciality. You always gain the benefits
of that Art Speciality, no matter what instrument or art you are
using.]

## Battle Hymn Specialization 

[At 8th level, the range of your battle hymns increases to 60 feet.]{.c6
.c17}

In addition, choose one of the following.

-   [You can expend two uses of Bardic Inspiration to activate two
    Battle Hymns at the same time. Losing concentration or changing
    battle hymns ends both hymns.]
-   [Pick three spells of 4th-level or lower that have only vocalized
    components. These spells can be from any class spell list. You can
    spend two uses of Bardic Inspiration to cast one of the chosen
    spells at the start of your turn without using an action. If you do,
    you can't activate a battle hymn that turn.]
-   [When you expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to activate a battle
    hymn, you can also grant a Bardic Inspiration die to a creature
    within 60 feet.]

[Whenever you gain a bard level, you can change your Battle Hymn
Specialization.]

### Art Mastery 

[At 11th level, you gain one of the following art masteries. At 17th
level, you gain an additional art mastery.]

Percussion: Rolling Rhythm.[ When using a percussion instrument
as a spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets only one creature,
you can target an additional creature. The additional target must be
within range of the first (as if the original target were casting the
spell). You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your
proficiency bonus (rounded down) per rest.]

String Instruments: Melody for All.[ You gain a number of melody
charges equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), which you regain
whenever you finish a long rest. When using a string instrument as a
spell focus, if you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can
spend a melody charge to target an additional creature within the
spell's range.]

Visual: Dual Masterpiece.[ When using visual art as a spell
focus, if you cast a bard spell that uses an ally as its point of origin
and then cast that spell again on your next turn, the spell is cast as
if you had used a spell slot two levels higher. You can use this feature
a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.]{.c6
.c17}

Voice: Everlasting Song.[ When concentrating on a bard spell you
cast using your voice as a spell focus, you automatically succeed on
checks made to maintain concentration on that spell.]

Wind Instruments: Perfect Pitch.[ While using a wind instrument
as a spell focus, you gain advantage on Deception and Performance checks
to conceal the casting of bard spells.]

## Universal Trick 

[At 13th, 16th, and 19th level, you learn a developed talent from the
berserker class, a sign of faith from the cleric class, a soldiering
knack from the fighter class, or an elective study from the wizard
class. You can't learn more than one Universal Trick from any individual
class.]

## Grand Battle Hymns 

[At 17th level,  you learn one of the following grand battle hymns,
which doesn't count against the number of battle hymns you know.]{.c6
.c17}

Beyond the Grave.[ When you activate this hymn, each ally within
60 feet that is bloodied or unconscious is restored to half their hit
point maximum. In addition, each target recovers from up to 3 levels of
fatigue.]

Magic Never Dies.[ When you activate this hymn, each ally within
30 feet regains up to five levels worth of spell slots or gains 30
temporary hit points.]

Taste of Victory.[ When you activate this hymn, each ally within
30 feet of you gains a blessing of victory that lasts for 24 hours or
until it is expended. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or
contested ability check, they can expend their blessing of victory to
gain advantage on the roll.]

[Once you have activated your grand battle hymn, you can't do so again
until you finish a long rest.]

## Virtuoso 

[At 20th level, you can use an action and expend a use of Bardic
Inspiration to start an epic performance that lasts for 1d4 rounds.
While the performance lasts, you can choose up to 50 creatures that are
within 120 feet and that can hear or see your performance. Each creature
you choose makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target
is charmed by you for the performance's duration and for 6 days
afterwards, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. A
charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance.]

[The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced, or if
you voluntarily end it (no action required). At the end of the
performance, you can extend the duration by 1d4 rounds by expending an
additional use of Bardic Inspiration.]

If your epic performance lasts at least 1 minute, when the performance
ends each charmed creature you choose is affected by a [mass suggestion
][spell cast at 9th level. Creatures do not make saving throws to
resist this effect. The commands you give a charmed creature are not
obvious, and other creatures must make an Insight check contested by
your Performance check to notice that you are doing anything more than
giving a performance. You can give each creature its own set of commands
but can give out only six different sets of commands.]

[Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.]

### Cunning Words 

[Also at 3rd level, when a creature that you can see within 60 feet
makes an ability check, attack roll, or damage roll, you can use your
reaction to expend a use of Bardic Inspiration. If you do, roll a Bardic
Inspiration die and subtract the number rolled from the creature's roll.
If you roll the minimum or maximum result on your Bardic Inspiration
die, the creature is rattled until the end of your next turn.]

[You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll,

immune to this feature if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being
charmed.]

[Also starting at 3rd level, when you have granted a creature Bardic
Inspiration, if the creature would make a saving throw at the end of its
turn to end an effect on it, it can expend the Bardic Inspiration to
attempt a saving throw at the start of its turn instead.]

[In addition, you can use Bardic Inspiration on yourself, but only to
make Performance checks.]

### Endless Legends 

[Starting at 6th level, you can use Bardic Inspiration an additional
number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum one). In
addition, when a creature rolls your Bardic Inspiration die, it gains a
bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum +1).]

### Act of Unison 

[Starting at 14th level, on your turn you can use an action and a bonus
action to expend a use of Bardic Inspiration and choose a creature you
can see within 60 feet. If the creature can see or hear you, it gains an
action, which it must use before the end of your turn. A creature can
benefit from this feature only once between long rests.]

## Mountebank 

### Bonus Proficiency and Specialties 

[When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in
Deception and Persuasion. If you are already proficient in either skill,
you instead gain an expertise die. In addition, you gain additional
specialties equal to your proficiency bonus, and you gain another
specialty whenever your proficiency bonus increases. These bonus
specialties must be in Deception or Persuasion.]

### Rapid Response 

[Also starting at 3rd level, when initiative is rolled and you are not
surprised, you can choose to cast a spell with a vocalized component and
casting time of 1 action. If you do so, the effects of the spell occur
at the start of the first creature's turn, and on your first turn you do
not receive an action.]

### Honeyed Words 

[Starting at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell, you can replace any
vocalized components with speech and any seen components with gestures.
Any observers with a passive Insight score equal to or less than your
passive Deception or Perception score do not see or hear you cast the
spell. If you make a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check as
part of your speech or gestures, the effects of the spell occur before
the check is made.]

[You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus per long rest.]

### Kill Me Last 

[At 14th level, when a creature you can see targets you with an attack
or spell, you can use your reaction to focus its attention on a creature
you choose within its reach or within range of it. It makes a Charisma
saving throw and on a failure, it instead targets the chosen creature
with its attack or spell (gaining advantage if the chosen creature is an
ally).]

[You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus per long rest.]

## Warchanter 

### Bonus Proficiency and Specialties 

[When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in
History. If you are already proficient in History, you instead gain an
expertise die in that skill. In addition, you gain additional
specialties in History equal to your proficiency bonus, and you gain
another specialty whenever your proficiency bonus increases.]

[In addition, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and
martial weapons.]

### Victorious Hymn 

[Also at 3rd level, you learn an additional battle hymn chosen from the
Battle Hymns table. When choosing this battle hymn, double your bard
level for the purposes of meeting the hymn's prerequisites. This battle
hymn does not count against your number of battle hymns known. When you
reach 8th level, you can trade one of the battle hymns you know for a
new Victorious Hymn.]

### Second Chorus 

[Starting at 6th level, when you see a spell cast on an ally within 30
feet, you can use your reaction and expend a use of Bardic Inspiration.
If the spell is 3rd level or lower, targets only that ally, and you are
also within the spell's range, you are also targeted by the spell.]{.c6
.c17}

[When you reach 14th level in this class, you can expend two uses of
Bardic Inspiration to target a different ally instead of you.]

### Slaying Momentum 

[At 14th level, when an ally under the effects of one of your battle
hymns reduces a creature to 0 hit points, they regain hit points equal
to your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier.]

### Elemental Wrath

Critical. For a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, the

impressive might. In addition to their offering, they are eager to tell
you about their home and neighbors.]

and an additional effect dependent on your chosen Cleric Archetype.]{.c6
.c17}

[You may choose which Channel Divinity effect to create each time you
use this feature. You must then finish a rest before you're able to
Channel Divinity again.]

[If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, use your cleric
spell save DC.]

[Starting at 6th level you can use your Channel Divinity twice between
rests, and beginning at 18th level you can use it three times between
rests.]

### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead 

[As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a divine word.
Each undead creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage. ][A turned creature must use its movement to move
away from you and its actions to Dash or to escape from an effect that
prevents it from moving away. If it can't move away, it can take the
Dodge action. It can't willingly approach within 30 feet of you and it
can't take reactions.]

## Principles of Devotion 

[At 2nd level, you pledge to uphold certain standards of behavior beyond
what is necessary for adventure. In return, your greater entity grants
you one of the following related boons. When you fail to uphold this
pledge, you lose any benefits from it until 24 hours after you finish a
long rest and rededicate yourself.]

### Chaste 

[In exchange for forgoing pleasures of the heart and flesh, you are
hardened to the persuasions of others. Add your Wisdom modifier (minimum
+1) to saving throws made to resist being charmed. You also gain one
skill specialty chosen from Insight, Persuasion, or Religion.]

### Destitute 

[In exchange for forgoing material luxury, vendors who are not
explicitly opposed to your greater entity are compelled to give you
heavy discounts of up to 20 percent, and inkeeps offer you free
lodging.]

### Devotional Integrity 

[When an action you take is honest and non-violent, until the end of
your turn you are immune to the rattled condition and you do not suffer
disadvantage or penalties on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks
made as part of that action.]

### Image of the Divine 

[You exhibit a uniform, makeup, tattoo, or body modification indicating
your higher entity or religious order. Creatures have advantage when
discerning your religious identity. You gain advantage on saving throws
against fear and ability checks made against Intimidation. You also gain
one skill specialty chosen from Insight, Intimidation, or
Persuasion.]

### Merciful 

[In exchange for forgoing bloodshed---torture, attacking unconscious
creatures, and dealing lethal wounds to creatures you reduce to 0 hit
points---you are yourself granted mercy. When you have already succeeded
on two death saving throws, you have advantage on death saving
throws.]

### Rule of Ritual 

[You make formal religious observances and perform ritual timekeeping.
You can spend 1 hour during a long rest to make these observances, and
if you do you only need 4 hours of sleep instead of the normal 6. You
learn the ]guidance [cantrip if you don't already know it,
and when you use a spell of 1st-level or higher to grant an expertise
die, the expertise die you grant increases by one step.]

### Secrecy 

[Your mission from your deity requires you to work undercover,
concealing your true self with a secret identity. In exchange for
forgoing the pleasure of true connection and friendship, you gain an
expertise die on Deception checks.]

### Severity 

[In exchange for forgoing weaknesses such as helping or protecting
others (except when it serves you), you add your Wisdom modifier
(minimum +1) to Perception checks made to find valuable objects, and on
contested checks made against the Persuasion check of another
creature.]

### Silence 

[The only time you may speak is while casting spells. Otherwise you
adhere to a vow of silence. In exchange, others can feel your dedication
and intent with a mere glance. When a creature within 10 feet of you
makes a Persuasion check, you can add your Wisdom modifier (minimum +1)
to the result.]

## Signs of Faith 

[At 3rd level, you gain a sign of faith of your choice. Signs of faith
are detailed at the end of your class description. The Signs Known
column of the Cleric table shows when you gain new signs.]

## Ability Score Improvement 

[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]

## Sacred Office 

Also at 4th level, choose one of the following.

### Auspicious Collaborator 

[You gain one specialty chosen from Culture or Persuasion, and you gain
an expertise die on Persuasion checks related to seeking aid.]

### Divine Authority 

[Your connection to religious hierarchy opens many doors. Sermons you
give and courtesy calls you make to different religious groups put you
in contact with a local representative of your faith, who is happy to
strongly recommend you to another local leader. You gain one specialty
chosen from Culture, Insight, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain an
expertise die on Culture, Insight, and Persuasion checks made against
local leaders to whom you are recommended that would otherwise be
indifferent towards you.]

### Engaging Proclaimer 

[You gain an expertise die on Performance checks to gather and hold the
attention of two or more people. In addition, you gain two skill
specialties, chosen from Performance or Religion.]

### Reputation 

[Common folk frequently recognize you on sight, and those who do often
have a friendly disposition towards you. They often ask you for counsel,
favors, and blessings. The disposition of people they introduce you to
are one step better than normal (the indifferent become friendly, the
hostile become indifferent).]

### Symbol of Might 

[You gain one Intimidation specialty, and you gain an expertise die on
Intimidation checks made to convince others to comply with your demands.
The people you intimidate are no longer friendly towards you, if they
were previously.]

## Empowered Turning 

[At 5th level your greater entity grants you improved ways to turn
undead or other abhorrent beings. You gain this feature again at 8th,
11th, 14th, and 17th level. Each time you gain Empowered Turning, choose
one of the following:]

### Command Undead 

[If you choose, creatures you turn instead regard you as their master
for the duration. While they are under this effect, you can use your
action to issue simple commands (no more than a sentence or two) which
they are compelled to obey. They will not take any action that is
obviously harmful to them, and so will not leap from a great height,
jump onto a sword, or purposefully self-inflict any damage. They follow
the command until you issue a new one.]

### Destroy Undead 

[Creatures turned by you of CR 1/2 or less are immediately destroyed,
transformed into dust by a blinding flash of light. You can select this
option multiple times. Each time you choose it, you are able to destroy
more powerful creatures, progressing to CR 1, CR 2, CR 3, and then CR 4
each subsequent time you select this option.]

### Turn Ideology 

[Choose one of the following: Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful. When you
use Turn Undead, you can also choose to affect creatures with the chosen
alignment trait. You can select this option multiple times, choosing a
different alignment trait each time.]

### Turn Supernatural 

[Choose a creature type from celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend. When
you use Turn Undead, you can also choose to affect creatures of that
type. You can select this option multiple times, choosing a different
creature type each time.]

## Sacred Presence 

[At 9th level, you bring the true presence of your ideals wherever you
go. Choose one of the following.]

### Cosmic Idealist 

[Choose Chaotic, Evil, Good, Lawful, or one of the following: Chaotic
and Evil, Chaotic and Good, Lawful and Evil, or Lawful and Good. You
gain the chosen alignment trait or alignment traits. You can identify
creatures that have the same alignment traits as you, and you have
advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability checks you make
against them.]

[Additionally, you do not suffer negative effects from being on a plane
with which you share an alignment trait.]

### Eyes of the Heart 

[When you succeed on a contested Insight check, if the opposing
creature's Charisma score is equal to or less than your spell save DC,
for the next 24 hours you do not need to make any further checks to
recognize whenever that creature is lying, telling the truth, or
withholding information.]

### Spiritual Salve 

[Your constant encouragements and proverbs allow allies within 30 feet
of you to reroll a Constitution check or saving throw that they fail. If
they do so, they must use the new roll. This feature can't be used on
saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell. Once a creature
has used your Spiritual Salve to make a reroll, it can't do so again
until it has finished a long rest.]

## Providence 

[At 10th level, the potency of your faith increases. Choose one of the
following.]

### Divine Intervention 

[Starting at 10th level, you can use an action to pray for a miracle.
Make a request and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to
or lower than your cleric level, your request is granted in a manner
chosen by the Narrator. The Narrator chooses the nature of the
intervention, which might take the form of the effect of any cleric
spell or cleric archetype spell. You can use this feature once between
long rests, but you if your deity intervenes you can't use it again for
7 days.]

[After each failed divine intervention roll, add 1 to the number
required to succeed until it is a success, at which point it resets to
your cleric level.]

[At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically.]{.c6
.c7}

### Imminent Turning 

You can Turn Undead from up to 60 feet away.

### Master Ritualist 

[You can cast any ritual spell on the cleric spell list you could cast
as a ritual, whether or not you have it prepared.]

### Prayer of Protection 

[After each long rest choose one damage type from the following list:
cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, psychic, radiant, or thunder.
You gain resistance to this damage type until the end of your next long
rest.]

## Avatar of Faith 

[At 20th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to become a conduit of
the divine, flooding the world around you with the unfettered power of
the Moral Planes. Once you have used either of these options, you can't
use that option again until you finish a long rest.]

### Channel Negative Energy 

[Each creature of your choice that you can see must make a Charisma
saving throw, taking 5d10 damage force damage and 5d10 necrotic damage
on a failure or half damage on a success.]

[When you use this feature, you also choose one of the following
conditions: blinded, confused, deafened, frightened, poisoned, rattled,
or slowed. A creature that failed its saving throw also gains the chosen
condition. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the
saving throw to end the effect on itself.]

[In addition, you can choose any number of creatures you can see that
have the Evil alignment trait. Each creature regains 5d10 hit
points.]

### Channel Positive Energy 

[You restore up to 200 hit points, divided as you choose among any
number of creatures that you can see.]

[A creature that regains hit points from this feature also recovers from
one level of fatigue and one level of strife, and if it is blinded,
charmed, confused, deafened, doomed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified,
poisoned, rattled, slowed, or stunned, those conditions end for it. This
feature can't be used on undead or constructs.]

# Signs of Faith 

[When you gain access to a new sign of faith, choose one of the
following.]

## Ancestral Guidance 

[In addition to the spells you normally prepare, you always have
]speak with dead[ prepared, and you can use this feature to
cast it once between long rests without spending a spell slot. When you
do so, you do not have to target a corpse; you can also target a grave
marker, memorial, statue, painting, or other depiction of the deceased
creature you wish to talk to. If the chosen creature is not dead, or if
such a creature never existed in the first place, the spell fails.]{.c6
.c7}

## Compassionate Nurse 

[You gain an expertise die on Medicine checks. In addition, you can use
Wisdom when making Medicine checks.]

## Faithful Historian 

[You gain an expertise die on History checks. In addition, you can use
Wisdom when making History checks.]

## Gentle Healer 

[During a short rest, you can spend uses from your healer's satchel to
aid your allies in their recovery. A creature you choose can roll each
expended hit die twice, taking the higher result. You can't expend your
own hit dice while using this feature, since you use all of your
energies to heal your companions.]

## Graceful Fall 

[Falling from a height greater than 30 feet causes your greater entity
to intervene. You are protected as if by the ][feather
fall] spell. This sign does not use your reaction.

## Monastic Austerity 

[The first level of fatigue you would take each day is prevented.]{.c6
.c7}

## Numinous Awareness 

[When you see a creature that appears to be a beast, you automatically
recognize whether it is a celestial, fiend, or fey. You have advantage
on Arcana and Medicine checks made to interact with magical wounds and
maladies caused by celestials, fiends, and fey.]

## Premonition 

[You have the ability to interpret messages sent to you in dreams or
visions by your greater entity. After each long rest, you receive one of
the following:]

-   [A piece of information that will help in your endeavors before the
    end of your next long rest,]
-   [A premonition. Roll a d20. Before the end of your next long rest,
    you can choose to replace any roll made by a creature within 30 feet
    that you can see with the result of this d20 roll.]

[The Narrator lets you know which benefit is available whenever you
finish a long rest.]

## Preservation 

[Your connection to a greater entity allows you to sense poison or
disease in food, drink, or other consumables. You must make direct
contact with them or their container in order to sense this
corruption.]

## Righteous Path 

[Once per day you can choose to walk the Righteous Path for 1 hour.
While walking the Righteous Path, you are aware when enemies are within
60 feet of you, and you know if backtracking or alternate routes could
avoid them. You can also use an action to sense if there are traps
within 30 feet, but not the location or nature of the traps.]

## Soothing Words 

[Once between long rests, you can reduce one ally's strife by one
level.]

## Supernal Intuition 

[Choose a creature type from  celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or
undead. You know when a creature of this type is within 60 feet of you,
although you don't know its location. The ][nondetection
][spell protects against this feature. You can select this sign
multiple times, choosing a different creature type each time.]

## Theologian 

[You gain an expertise die on Religion checks. In addition, you can use
Wisdom when making Religion checks.]

## Voice of Doom 

[You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. In addition, you can
use Wisdom when making Intimidation checks.]

### Unfickle Fate 

[Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, once between long
rests you can use an action to touch a willing creature and grant them a
single premonition that they remember for 1 hour. While they remember
the premonition, the creature can choose to reroll an attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw and use the new result, after which the
premonition is gone from its mind.]

### Channel Divinity: All-Seeing Oracle 

[Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly
look through the eyes of another creature you name. As long as the
creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, you recall a still

the creature is dead, blinded, unconscious, or protected from divination
magic, this feature has no effect.]

### Channel Divinity: Aural Oracle 

[At 6th level, you are able to use your Channel Divinity to see and hear
through the senses of another creature you name for 1 minute. As long as
the creature is alive and on the same plane of existence, it makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see what it sees and hear
what it hears. An unconscious creature automatically fails its save but
only hears (it sees nothing). You can't see through the eyes of a
blinded creature or hear through the ears of a deafened creature. If the
creature is dead or protected from divination magic, this feature has no
effect. While using this feature, you become blinded and deafened to
your surroundings. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this
feature for 24 hours.]

### Potent Premonitions 

[Starting at 8th level, your premonitions are more powerful. Your
Unfickle Fate feature now lasts up to 8 hours. In addition, you gain one

[Starting at 17th level, your ability to see from the perspective of
another creature using Channel Divinity reaches its ultimate form. As
long as the creature you name is alive and on the same plane of
existence, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can see and

minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 minute).]

knowledge related to a single object, place, person, or subject. The
subject and place must be somewhat specific. ]

[You can't see through the eyes of a blinded creature or hear through
the ears of a deafened creature. If the creature is dead or protected
from divination magic, this feature has no effect. An unconscious
creature automatically fails its saving throw and you may hear what it
hears and access its knowledge. While using this feature, you become
blinded and deafened to your surroundings. On a successful save, a
creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours.]

surrounding them with a coruscating shimmer of bright light. Until the
start of your next turn, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls

### Channel Divinity: Radiant Burst 

[Starting at 2nd level, you can use an action to clutch your holy symbol
and emit a bright blast. In addition to dispelling any magical darkness
within 30 feet, creatures of your choice within 30 feet must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw or be blinded by the light for 1 minute. A
blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.]

[Alternatively, you can choose to make the light more harmful. On a
failed saving throw, a creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 +
your cleric level instead of being blinded, or half damage on a
success.]

feet of you, in addition to creatures you can touch.]

modifier (minimum +1). You must choose the damage type at the beginning
of each long rest, and can't change it until you have finished another
long rest.]

### Channel Divinity: Summon the Stars 

[Starting at 17th level, you can use an action to choose an object or
creature you can see within 60 feet. For 1 minute, the target emits
bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30
feet. When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the target or
first enters a space within 30 feet of the target on its turn, it must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A
blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.]

[The first time you use this feature  per long rest, each creature
within 30 feet of the target takes 12d6 radiant damage on a failed save,
or half damage on a success. Magical auras within the light's radius
become visible, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1 hour. An
invisible creature that fails its saving throw against the radiant
damage is also revealed, and it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius for 1
hour.]

    and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving
    throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

    resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities, traits, actions, and

[You also learn to tap into the intricate ebb and flow of life around
you and how to divert it as you see fit. You can cast the spells

knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or
floor, the target takes an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. If the
target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a

difficult terrain for 1 minute.]

Water.[ You create a 20-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide wave that
travels 30 feet in one direction and then crashes down. Any Large or
smaller objects and creatures in the wave's path make a Strength saving

bludgeoning damage and is carried along with the wave. On a success, the
target takes no damage and isn't moved.]

throw against your maneuver DC or become frightened for 1 minute.]{.c6

[Starting at 10th level, you can use a bonus action to expend a use of
Panache to challenge a creature within 30 feet to an honorable duel.
Once you challenge a creature in this way, you have disadvantage on
attacks against creatures other than the challenged creature, and the
challenged creature has disadvantage on attacks against creatures other
than you. A creature remains challenged in this way until either you or
the challenged creature is incapacitated, dies, or ends their turn out
of line of sight from the other. The challenge also ends if you use this
feature again to challenge a different creature, or if a third creature
challenges either you or your challenged creature.]

### Elusive 

[Starting at 15th level, your movement out of a creature's threatened
area does not provoke opportunity attacks. In addition, whenever you
parry an attack using a parrying weapon, the expertise die to your AC
increases by one step.]

### Master Duelist 

[Starting at 18th level, you have advantage on melee weapon attacks
against creatures you are currently challenging using your Duelist's
Challenge feature.]

## Gladiator 

### Arena Training 

[At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills:
Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, or Performance.]

### Gladiatorial Traditions 

[Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following combat
traditions of your choice: Mist and Shade, Razor's Edge, Tooth and Claw.
When you gain this feature you can choose one of the maneuvers you know
and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from
your newly chosen combat tradition.]

### Bloodsport Flourishes 

[Starting at 3rd level, you treat any weapon you wield as if it had the
Flamboyant property. In addition, whenever you critically hit with a
weapon attack, you can choose to perform either a Bloody Flourish or
Glorious Flourish.]

Bloody Flourish.[ You make an Intimidation check. Each
hostile creature within 20 feet that can see you makes a Wisdom saving
throw against a DC equal to the result of your Intimidation check. On a
failure, a creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next
turn.]

Glorious Flourish.[ Make a Performance check. Each hostile
creature within 20 feet that can see you makes a Charisma saving throw
against a DC equal to the result of your Performance check. On a
failure, a creature becomes charmed by you until the end of your next
turn.]

### Champion of the Arena 

[Starting at 7th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a
roll of 19--20. If you already have a feature that increases the range
of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum
17--20).]

### Gladiatorial Reputation 

[When you gain this feature at 10th level, you gain every feature from
Reputation instead of only selecting one.]

### Unmistakable Presence 

[Starting at 15th level, the range of your Bloodsport Flourishes
increases from 20 feet to 60 feet.]

### Effortless Flourishes 

[Starting at 18th level, you can use a bonus action to perform a
Bloodsport Flourish (without requiring an attack or critical hit).]{.c6
.c7}

## Knight 

### Armory Training 

At 3rd level, you gain the following benefits:

-   [Your passive Perception is not reduced while wearing a helm or
    visored helm.]
-   [You never suffer fatigue from wearing armor or sleeping in
    armor.]
-   [You can don or doff armor in half the time it would normally
    take.]

    wearing armor or using a heavy shield.]

### Chivalrous Traditions 

[Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following combat
traditions of your choice: Adamant Mountain, Sanguine Knot, Spirited
Steed. When you gain this feature you can choose one of the maneuvers
you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or
lower from your newly chosen combat tradition.]

### Honor Bound 

Also at 3rd level, choose one of the following.

Loyal to the Crown.[ You are loyal to a specific nation,
lord, organization, or other authority. While you are in good standing
with that authority and are within their area of influence, you and your
allies can easily find free food and lodging, and creatures with a CR
lower than your level that are also loyal to that authority may perform
simple tasks at your request. You lose good standing with that authority
if you go against their wishes. Consult the Narrator on authorities
within the campaign setting, their wishes, and what will keep or return
you to good standing with them.]

Loyal to the Code.[ You are loyal to a specific code of
honor. You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. However, whenever
you break your code you suffer a level of strife and instead have
disadvantage on Persuasion checks for the following 7 days. Choose one
of the following codes to keep:]

-   I will never harm a creature that has surrendered.
-   I will never steal from a living soul.
-   I will never let a lie pass my lips.

[Alternatively, consult the Narrator for any codes specific to the
campaign setting.]

### Inspiring Charge 

[Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to spend 1 exertion and
perform an Inspiring Charge. Move up to your Speed (or your mount's
Speed) in a straight line and make a melee weapon attack. You gain an
expertise die on this attack. Until the end of your next turn, attacks
made by you or allies within 10 feet gain an expertise die.]

### Additional Fighting Style 

[At 10th level, you gain an additional Fighting Style from the following
list: Battle Ready, Defense, Dueling, Great Weapon Fighting, Mounted
Combatant, Protection, Tireless Fighting.]

### Ever-Ready 

[Starting at 15th level, whenever you roll for initiative and have no
exertion points remaining, you gain a number of exertion points equal to
your proficiency bonus.]

### Knight of Renown 

[At 18th level, the range of your Inspiring Charge increases from 10
feet to 60 feet, and any of your allies that enter that area for the
first time on their turn or begin their turn there gain inspiration. A
creature can gain inspiration in this way only once between long
rests.]

## Sharpshooter 

### Crack Shot 

[Starting at 3rd level, your training with ranged weapons grants the
following benefits:]

-   [You do not have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls due to being
    within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range.]{.c6
    .c7}
-   [Your ranged weapon attack rolls ignore half cover and
    three-quarters cover.]

### Sharpshooting Traditions 

[Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following combat
traditions of your choice: Biting Zephyr, Razor's Edge, Unending Wheel.
When you gain this feature you can choose one of the maneuvers you know
and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from
your newly chosen combat tradition.]

### Focus Shot 

[At 7th level, once per turn, whenever you take the Attack action and
are able to make multiple ranged attacks, you can forgo one of those
ranged attacks to turn one of your remaining attacks into a Focus Shot.
When you make a Focus Shot, choose one of the following options and make
a ranged weapon attack. You gain an expertise die on the attack, and on
a hit it does your chosen effect in addition to the weapon's
damage.]

Aim for the Eyes.[ You aim for the creature's weak and
delicate eyes. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your
maneuver DC or is blinded until it recovers.]

Bring it Down.[ You aim for weak points on the creature's
legs. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver
DC or its Speed is reduced by half until it recovers.]

Center of Mass.[ You aim for the heart or its horrid
equivalent. Your attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 19--20. If
you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical
hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17--20).]

Vein Slice.[ You aim for a vital vein or artery to bleed
your target out. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against
your maneuver DC or it takes 1d6 ongoing damage until it recovers.]{.c6
.c7}

Wing Clip.[ You aim for your target's wings. The target
makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure,
its fly speed is reduced by half until it recovers. A creature that
fails this saving throw while flying immediately falls 60 feet, taking
damage as normal if it strikes a solid surface.]

[A creature wounded by any of these effects makes a Constitution saving
throw against your maneuver DC at the end of each of its turns,
recovering and ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively,
the wounded creature (or a creature within 5 feet of it) can use an
action to make a Medicine check against your maneuver DC, ending the
effect on a success. Healing magically or from a trait (such as
Regeneration) also ends the effect. You can't choose effects that
specifically target body parts a creature doesn't have.]

### Hawkeye 

[At 10th level, you gain an expertise die on Investigation and
Perception checks, and when rolling initiative.]

### Reflexive Shot 

[At 15th level, you can make opportunity attacks using ranged weapons,
and your threatened area is equal to the normal range of any ranged
weapon you wield.]

### Critical Shot 

[At 18th level, whenever you take the Attack action and are able to make
multiple ranged attacks, you can forgo all of those ranged attacks
except for one to turn that remaining attack into a Critical Shot,
making a ranged weapon attack with advantage. If your Critical Shot
hits, it becomes a critical hit.]

##  

## Hit Points 

Hit Dice: 1d10 per herald level

Hit Points at 1st Level: [10 + your Constitution
modifier]

Hit Points at Higher Levels: [1d10 (or 6) + your
Constitution modifier per herald level after 1st]

## Proficiencies 

Armor: [Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor,
shields]

Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons

Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma

Skills: [Choose two from Athletics, Acrobatics, History,
Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion]

## Equipment 

[You begin the game with 200 gp. You can select your own gear or choose
one of the following equipment packages. Also consult the Suggested
Equipment section of your chosen background.]

-   Blessed Explorer's Set (Cost 189 gp): [4 handaxes,
    hauberk, priest's pack]
-   Divine Warrior's Set (Cost 200 gp): [Longsword,
    hauberk, medium shield, explorer's pack]

## Divine Sense 

[Choose one of the following sets of creatures: celestials and fiends,
fey and elementals, or aberrations and undead. You can sense when a
creature of one of your chosen types is within 30 feet of you, but you
can't determine their number, type, or location. As a bonus action, you
can focus your senses to learn the location, number, and type of any
creatures of your chosen types within 30 feet of you. When you do so,
creatures of those types that are within range make a Wisdom saving
throw against your spell save DC, with advantage if the creature's CR is
higher than your herald level. On a failed save, you also learn the
creature's identity. You also detect any locations within 30 feet that
have been consecrated or desecrated with the ]hallow[ spell
or another effect.]

[You can activate this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum one time), and you regain spent uses when you finish a
long rest. Upon finishing a long rest, you may also swap your chosen set
of creature types for another.]

## Lay on Hands 

[You have a pool of power equal to your herald level × 5 that
replenishes when you finish a long rest. As an action, you can touch a
creature and spend from this pool of power to restore hit points equal
to the number of points you chose to expend. This healing can't bring a
creature above their hit point maximum.]

[Alternatively, you can spend 5 points to touch a creature and cure one
disease or neutralize one poison currently affecting the creature. You
can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single
use of Lay on Hands if you can expend sufficient points.]

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Spellcasting 

You have learned to use divine magic.

### Cantrips 

[You learn two herald cantrips of your choice at 1st level and
additional herald cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Herald Spells table.]

### Preparing and Casting Spells 

To prepare herald spells to make them available to cast, choose a number
of spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your herald level
(minimum of one spell) from the herald spell list. You cannot prepare a
spell of a higher level than your highest level spell slot.

[To cast a herald spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell's
level or higher.The Herald Spells table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your herald spells. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.]

[Casting a spell does not remove it from your list of prepared
spells.You can change the spells you have prepared by spending at least
1 minute per spell level reflecting in meditation.]

## Spellcasting Ability 

[Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your herald spells. You use
your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier to set the attack bonus and
saving throw DC for your herald spells, as follows:]

Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier]

Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your
Charisma modifier]

### Spellcasting Focus 

[When casting a herald spell, you can use a holy symbol as your
spellcasting focus.]

## Combat Maneuvers 

[At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain
proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Sanguine
Knot, Spirited Steed, or Tempered Iron. You learn two maneuvers of your
choice from traditions you are proficient with.]

[You use your maneuvers by spending exertion points, but you do not gain
an exertion pool. Instead, at the start of each of your turns you can
expend spell slots of 1st-level or higher to gain exertion points that
go into a temporary exertion pool which lasts until you start your next
long rest. You gain 2 exertion points for a 1st-level spell slot, and 2
more for each spell slot level above 1st. Only spell slots gained from
the herald class can be expended in this way.]

[The Maneuvers Known column of the Herald table shows when you learn
more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the
Maneuver Degree column shows the highest-degree maneuver you can select
at a given level.]

[Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of
the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same
degree from a tradition you are proficient with.]

## Divine Smite 

Starting at 2nd level,  whenever you hit a creature with a weapon
attack, you can choose to deliver a divine smite that deals an extra 1d8
radiant damage.The amount of extra damage increases at higher levels, as
shown on the Herald table.

[You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, and you regain spent uses when you finish a long rest.]

## Divine Lessons 

[At 3rd level, you gain a divine lesson of your choice. The divine
lessons available to you are detailed at the end of the class
description. The Lessons Known column of the Herald table shows when you
learn more divine lessons.]

## Herald Archetype 

[Also at 3rd level, you choose the oath and tenets that you as a herald
will swear to uphold. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and
again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.]

### Archetype School 

[Each archetype has an associated school of spells, which you gain
access to upon reaching 3rd level. You can choose spells from this
school when preparing your herald spells. If you would choose a spell
that is not on the herald spell list, it is considered a herald spell
for you.]

### Channel Divinity 

[When you choose an archetype, you gain the ability to Channel Divinity
once per rest. When you use this feature, you choose which option to
use. Each Channel Divinity option granted by your archetype explains how
to use it. Some Channel Divinity options require your target to make a
saving throw. In such a case, use your herald spell save DC.]

## Empowered Smite 

[At 4th level, you can manipulate magic to add extra power to your
smites. Whenever you would use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose
one of the following effects. Once you have used this feature, you can't
do so again until you finish a long rest. Alternatively, you can empower
a smite by expending a spell slot of 1st-level or higher.]

[Some empowerments require your target to make a saving throw. In such a
case, use your herald spell save DC.]

### Igniting Smite 

[Your smite deals fire damage instead of radiant damage, and the target
makes a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On
a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a success, it takes no
damage and the fire is extinguished. The fire can also be put out as an
action or by the environment, and it burns out naturally after 1
minute.]

### Marking Smite 

[Your smite causes the target to shed bright light for 5 feet, and dim
light for an additional 5 feet. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until
you target another creature with a weapon attack. As long as the effect
lasts, the target gains no benefit from invisibility and has
disadvantage on checks made to hide.]

### Repelling Smite 

[Your smite deals force damage instead of radiant damage, and the target
makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is pushed back 10
feet and knocked prone. On a success, it is pushed back 5 feet and isn't
knocked prone.]

## Ability Score Improvement 

At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.

## Extra Attack 

Starting at 5th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you
can attack twice instead of once.

## Heraldic Sermon 

Also at 5th level, choose one of the following features.

### Devout 

[You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. You have advantage on
Persuasion checks to influence others by discussing your oath or deity,
and witnesses that hear your words are inspired to share any useful or
important information they might have.]

### Evangelism 

[You gain proficiency in the Performance skill. You have advantage on
Performance checks to convert others when preaching about your oath or
deity, and witnesses that hear your words are inspired to donate to your
cause.]

### Fearmonger 

[You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. You have advantage on
Intimidation checks when using your faith to intimidate others, and
witnesses with opposing views make obvious efforts to avoid you.]{.c6
.c7}

## Sacred Aura 

[At 6th level, you can manifest an aura that aids you and your allies.
Each aura has a radius of 15 feet and is centered on you. You must be
conscious for you and your allies to benefit from the aura. You can have
only one of the following auras active at a time but can change which
aura is active whenever you finish a long rest. At 18th level, the
radius of all auras increases to 30 feet.]

### Aura of Courage

your Wisdom modifier, and you regain spent uses when you finish a long
rest.]

### Divine Health 

[You are immune to disease and have advantage on saving throws made to
resist the poisoned condition.]

feature once per long rest to cast it without expending a spell
slot.]

Charisma modifier (minimum 1) without suffering any adverse

Athletics check, you can apply the result of your roll to yourself and
one ally. You can choose which ally to apply your result to after
everyone has rolled, but you must do so before the Narrator says whether
you succeed or fail.]

### Glorious Purpose 

[When you agree to undertake a quest that specifically fulfills the
tenets of your herald archetype, you gain proficiency with a skill that
will be crucial to completing that quest. The skill is chosen by the
Narrator. If you are already proficient with the skill, you gain an
expertise die instead. The benefits of this divine lesson do not change
until the quest has been completed.]

and Survival checks made in this terrain. In addition, once each week
when you have run out of Supply, you can spend 8 hours in the wilderness
to find 1d4+2 Supply.]

### Prophetic Protection 

[Whenever you would trigger a trap, the Narrator makes a secret Charisma
(Perception) check for you against the DC to spot the trap. On a
success, you don't spot the trap but get a strong sense that moving any
further will put you in danger.]

### Seek Truths 

[You gain an expertise die on Insight checks made to discern the truth.
In addition, after you make a successful Insight check contested by a
creature's Deception check, you have advantage on Insight checks made
against that creature for 24 hours.]

### Channel Divinity 

[At 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you gain the following two
Channel Divinity options.]

Blessing of Nature.[ For the next hour, you have advantage
on Persuasion checks made to influence druids and beasts. Alternatively,
you can end the blessing early to gain advantage on a Survival check
made to find Supply or a haven in the wilderness.]

Rely on Nature. [When you fail a Nature or Survival check,
you can use your reaction to succeed instead.]

### Empowered Bond

can cast it as a ritual. When you cast the spell, you can choose one of
the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special
forms: awakened shrub, shrieker, sprite, or violet fungus.]

[Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of
your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own
with its reaction.]

### Nature's Sanctuary 

[At 7th level, when a beast or plant attacks you, it must make a Wisdom
saving throw against your herald spell save DC. The beast or plant has
advantage on this saving throw if it has a CR equal to or higher than
your herald level. On a failed save, the creature must choose a
different target or the attack automatically misses. On a successful
save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. A creature is
aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.]

[In addition, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or
fey.]

### Armaments of Nature 

[Starting at 15th level, you can use an action and expend one use of
Channel Divinity to cover yourself in bark, rock, soil, and vines for 1
hour.]

[For the duration, your Armor Class equals 10 + your proficiency bonus +
your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier, and when a creature
grappling you starts its turn, it takes 2d6 piercing damage.]

[In addition, you can use a bonus action to grow a melee weapon in your
hands. You are proficient with the weapon and it deals 1d12 bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the weapon's shape). While
wielding the weapon, your reach increases by 5 feet. The weapon can't be
disarmed, but it can be damaged (AC equal to your herald spell save DC
and hit points equal to your herald level).]

### Timeless Body 

[Also at 15th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age
more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
year.]

### Nature's Servant 

[At 20th level, if you start your turn bloodied, you regain hit points
equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. While your Armaments of Nature
feature is active, the amount of hit points you regain doubles, and you
regain hit points even when you aren't blooded. You don't gain these
benefits while you have 0 hit points.]

throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage and is
pushed back 5 feet. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't pushed
back.]

Positive Energy Flood. [As a bonus action, you can use your
Channel Divinity to send out a flood of positive energy to heal your
allies. Creatures you choose (including yourself) within 30 feet regain
hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier.]

### Aura of the Champion 

[Beginning at 7th level, you gain a third aura that is active alongside
your Sacred Aura and has the same range. Choose one of the following
options.]

Aura of Darkness. [After initiative is rolled, when a
hostile creature starts its turn in your aura or first enters into it on
a turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of
you for 1 minute. Once a creature has been frightened by this aura, it
is immune to the aura's effects for 24 hours.]

Aura of Light. [An unconscious ally with 0 hit points that

saving throw it makes that turn. Once a creature succeeds on three death
saving throws while in your aura, it can't benefit from this effect
again until it finishes a long rest.]

### Divine Protection

aura or first enters your aura on a turn, it takes necrotic damage equal
to 10 + your Charisma modifier.]

Emissary of Light. [You gain the Good alignment trait. You
can use an action to call upon your deity and emit an aura of sunlight.
For 1 minute, you shine bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light

Channel Divinity options.]

speak the truth. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw or finds
itself unable to be dishonest for 1 minute. Regardless of whether it
succeeds or fails, you know the outcome of the saving throw.]

Inquisitorial Challenge. [As a bonus action, you can use
your Channel Divinity to issue a challenge of combat to one creature you
can see within 30 feet. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature can't move more than 30 feet away from you and
has disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than you for 1
minute.]

### Mark of the Heretic 

[Beginning at 7th level, you can use a bonus action to choose one
creature you can see within 30 feet. The target is marked for 1 minute,
or until either you or the target die. While the target is marked, you

-   [Damage rolls you make against the creature deal extra damage equal
    to your spell attack modifier.]
-   [Attacks made by you or your allies score critical hits against the
    creature on a roll of 19--20.]
-   [The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw or it becomes outlined
    in a nimbus of light (of a color chosen by you) for the duration.
    This nimbus of light negates the benefits of invisibility on the
    creature.]

[If the marked target isn't killed or captured within 1 hour, you have
disadvantage on melee weapon attacks against other creatures until you
finish a rest.]

[Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish
a rest. At 15th level, you can use this feature twice between
rests.]

### Divine Justice 

[Starting at 15th level, when you use Mark of the Heretic, you need only
point at a creature to mark it. Additionally, when a creature marked by
this feature dies, you can apply the mark to another creature you can
see within 30 feet without expending another use of Mark of the
Heretic.]

### Ear for Deceit 

[At 20th level, when listening to a creature speak, provided you share
at least one language, you are immediately aware if it is being
dishonest---though you have no special ability to obtain the truth

divination, such as by the ]nondetection [spell, are immune
to this feature.]

coordination requires you to maintain concentration (as if concentrating
on a spell), and both chosen creatures---the one helping and the one
making the ability check---must be within 30 feet of you at the time the
ability check is made.]

[Each turn, you can use your bonus action to change which creatures
benefit from the coordination each turn. The skills that can benefit

Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Stealth, and Survival.]

#### Reach Further 

[While you are conscious, when a creature you choose within the radius
of your Commanding Presence would drop to 0 hit points, that creature

out of it, the shelter is indistinguishable from a natural object. It is
designed to allow you to see out while inside, but it prevents anyone
outside the shelter from seeing in.]

traits determined by its type. The creature is friendly to you and your
companions, takes its turn immediately after yours, and obeys your
verbal commands. The creature disappears after 1 hour, when it is

TABLE: ELEMENTAL MASTERY

WILDERNESS GUARDIANS

  ---------------------------- ----------------------------
  GUARDIAN TYPE   BASE CREATURE

  Earth             Earth elemental

Wilderness Guardian Template

[A wilderness guardian keeps the statistics of its base creature, except
as follows:]

Armor Class. [The guardian's Armor Class increases by
2.]

Challenge. [The guardian's challenge rating increases to CR
7.]

Languages.[ The guardian speaks Primordial, in addition to
any other languages it knows.]

New Trait: Primal Force. [The guardian gains +1 bonus to
attack rolls with its weapon attacks and deals an extra 5 force damage
on a hit.]

Multiattack.[ If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller
target, the target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the guardian uses its
Engulf on it.]

New Action: Engulf. [The guardian engulfs a Medium or
smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed creature is blinded,
restrained, can't breathe, and at the start of each of the guardian's
turns it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 +
4 bludgeoning damage (or fire damage for a fire guardian). If the
guardian moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. The guardian can
have only one creature engulfed at a time.]

New Action: Guard Life. [The guardian uses its Engulf on a
willing or unconscious ally without dealing damage. While engulfed, the
ally is grappled but not restrained, can see and breathe normally, and
has total cover. As soon as the ally takes an action, reaction, or bonus
action, they are no longer engulfed. The guardian can release the ally
at will (no action required).]

### Summon Stampede 

[Once per long rest, you can use an action to make all beasts within a
1-mile radius friendly to you for 1 minute. Alternatively, for 1 minute
on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), you can choose one of
the following effects. You can't choose the same effect two rounds in a
row. ]

Enraged Fauna.[ Up to three Huge native creatures of CR 8
or lower charge forward, bowling into your enemies. Choose any number of
creatures you can see within 100 feet. Each creature makes a Strength
saving throw against your maneuver DC, taking 6d8 bludgeoning damage on
a failure, or half damage on a success.]

[In addition, you can choose one of the Huge creatures to stay and
fight. Only one such creature can assist in this way at a time, and the
creature retreats when bloodied or when you command it to leave.]{.c6
.c7}

Rushing Stampede.[ A Huge-sized horde of Small, Medium, and
Large native creatures hurry through the area, traveling in a straight,
30-foot-wide line from a point you choose. Until the start of your next
turn, the area is difficult terrain. In addition, each creature you
chose in the area when you summon the stampede makes a Dexterity saving
throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6
bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is stunned until the start of
your next turn. On a success, the creature instead takes half damage and
is rattled until the start of your next turn.]

Swarming Pests.[ Several Medium-sized swarms of Tiny native
creatures enter the spaces of up to five Small, Medium, or Large
creatures you choose, or the space of one Huge or Gargantuan creature.
Each creature you choose when you summon the swarms makes a Constitution
saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failed save, a creature
loses concentration on any spell or effect it is concentrating on and is
blinded and slowed until the start of your next turn. On a success, the
creature is instead slowed until the start of your next turn.]

# Exploration Knacks 

[When you gain access to a new exploration knack, choose one of the
following.]

## Beast Friend 

[If you spend 10 minutes befriending and feeding a Medium or smaller
beast of CR 1/8 or less, you become its guardian ranger. It follows you
and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its
own initiative and acts on its own turn. The beast won't attack except
as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal
and makes death saving throws. You can be a guardian ranger to only one
beast at a time.]

## Build Shelter 

[You can spend 8 hours building a basic shelter that protects up to
eight Medium or smaller creatures from the elements and reduces the
likelihood of attack from monsters and bandits. The shelter counts as a
haven. It lasts for as long as it is needed but falls apart permanently
after being left for a month unattended.]

[Once you have used this knack, you can't do so again for 7 days.]{.c6
.c7}

## Calls of the Wild 

[Using verbal and nonverbal cues to communicate with beasts, you can
gain basic information from them or make a simple request (like
delivering a short message or small object).]

## Ear to the Ground 

[If you spend 1 minute without moving, you can deduce information about
your environment in a 30-foot radius, as if using blindsight or
tremorsense. The effect ends if you move or take an action.]

## Expert Foraging 

[Once between long rests, you can spend 1 minute to collect a number of
edible, non-poisonous plants and grubs equal to your proficiency bonus.
A creature can use its action to eat up to five plants or grubs, each of
which restores 1 hit point and constitutes 1 Supply. The plants and
grubs spoil 1 hour after being collected.]

## Forced Marcher 

[You can travel an additional number of hours equal to your proficiency
bonus before needing to make a Constitution saving throw for a forced
march.]

## Guide 

[While traveling, when you would roll a failure or critical failure for
a Scout journey activity, you can choose to succeed instead. In
addition, you can Scout while engaged in any other journey
activity.]

## Healing Salves 

[Once between long rests, you can spend an hour collecting natural
ingredients and concoct an ointment that speeds healing. This salve is
potent for 24 hours and has a number of uses equal to 1 + your Wisdom
modifier. As an action, you can use the salve to restore 1d4 hit points
to a creature within reach.]

## Herbal Bitters 

[You can spend an hour to collect ingredients and brew two servings of a
bitter drink that is potent for 24 hours. Imbibing a serving requires an
action and reduces fatigue by one level for 4 hours.]

## Huntsman 

[When you use the Hunt and Gather journey activity, you gain advantage
on your Survival checks.]

## Longwalker 

[When you would gain a level of fatigue due to lack of Supply during a
journey, you don't gain that level of fatigue. Alternatively, you can
choose to accept the level of fatigue, allowing up to two traveling
companions to forgo gaining a level of fatigue instead. Once you have
used this feature, you can't do so again for 7 days.]

## Master Tracker 

Prerequisite: 9th level

[Once between long rests, while outdoors you can spend 5 minutes
scouring the ground in a 30-foot-diameter area for clues. You learn all
events that transpired in the area in the last 24 hours as though you
had witnessed them yourself, although you don't learn secret information
not obvious to an observer. The information you gain is only that which
would be learned by sight.]

## Monster Mimic 

[By imitating how a beast or one of your studied adversaries sounds,
looks, and moves, you can gain advantage on Deception and Intimidation
checks made to convince a creature that it is seeing or hearing that
beast or studied adversary.]

## Poisons and Antidotes 

[Once between long rests, you can spend 1 hour searching your
environment and make a DC 10 Survival check. On a success, you collect
poisonous plants. You can spend 10 minutes to extract three doses of
liquid poison from the plants. A creature that ingests a dose of the
poison makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or is poisoned for 1
hour. Alternatively, you can spend 1 hour to create one dose of
antitoxin.]

## Read the Room 

[By spending 10 minutes observing facial expressions, body language, and
vocal intonation, you can detect minute details that give you insight
into the nature of creatures within 30 feet of you. For the next minute,
you can direct your focus on any one creature you can see within 30
feet.You learn the surface thoughts of the creature---what is most on
its mind in that moment. As an action, you can shift your attention to
another creature's thoughts. Creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or
lower or that doesn't speak a language can't be studied in this
way.]

## Relentless Pursuit 

[Once you have successfully picked up the tracks of a creature, you can
follow those tracks without any need for further checks for a period of
up to 7 days.]

## See the Unseen 

Prerequisite: 5th level

[Once between long rests, you can focus your attention on peripheral
sights, sounds, and other signs of unseen passage. For the next hour,
you can detect invisible creatures and objects, their location,
movement, and actions, and even sense creatures and objects in the
Ethereal Plane.]

additional sorcerer cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Sorcerer Spells table.]

### Spell Slots 

[To cast a sorcerer spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's

you have to cast your sorcerer spells. You regain all expended spell
slots when you finish a long rest.]

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher 

[At 1st level, you know your choice of four 1st-level spells from the
sorcerer spell list. Consult the Spells Known column of the Sorcerer
Spells table to see when you can choose more sorcerer spells. Each of
these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. ]{.c6
.c17}

Additionally, when you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace a sorcerer
spell you know with another from the sorcerer spell list, provided it is
of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability 

[Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use
your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier to set the saving throw DC for

Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma

## Manifestation 

[Also at 2nd level, choose one of the following manifestations. When you
cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder
damage, you can change the damage type to your manifestation's damage
type.]

### Blizzard (Cold) 

[When you cast a spell that deals cold damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes cold
damage from the spell, it is also chilled, reducing its movement speeds
by 10 feet for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level (minimum 1
round).]

### Corrosion (Acid) 

[When you cast a spell that deals acid damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes acid
damage from the spell, its Armor Class is reduced by 2 until the end of
your next turn.]

### Hurricane (Lightning or Thunder) 

[You can treat both lightning and thunder as your manifestation's damage
types. When you cast a spell that deals lightning or thunder damage, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to produce a thunderous blast around you.
Large or smaller creatures within 5 feet of you make a Strength saving
throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is
pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.]

### Inferno (Fire) 

[When you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes fire
damage from the spell, it is also set ablaze, taking 2d4 ongoing fire
damage for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, or until it
uses an action to put itself out.]

### Venom (Poison) 

[When you cast a spell that deals poison damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point. If you do, creatures immune to poison damage take half damage
from the spell, and creatures resistant to poison damage take full
damage.]

## Latent Power 

At 3rd level, choose one of the following.

### All Eyes 

[You gain an expertise die on Performance and Persuasion checks. In
addition, as a bonus action you can spend 1 sorcery point to put out a
subtle pulse that causes all creatures within 60 feet to take notice of
you, allowing you to speak and be heard even in the midst of chaos.
During combat, this notice lasts only a split second---not long enough
to distract, but allowing you to make a Charisma check as part of the
bonus action used to activate this feature.]

### Daunting Energy 

[You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. If you fail an
ability check or saving throw against a creature trying to intimidate
you, or against an effect that would cause you to become frightened, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the check or save. If you do, you
must use the new result.]

### Unsuspecting 

[You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. When you fail a
Deception check against a humanoid, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
reroll the check. On a success, their memory skips a beat and fills in
the gap with your new story. On a failure, not only do they not believe
you, but anyone who can cast spells and observed the exchange (including
your target, if applicable) recognizes your attempt at arcane
subterfuge.]

## Metamagic 

[At 3rd level, you gain two minor Metamagic options, and one moderate
Metamagic option. You gain another minor Metamagic option at 5th level,
10th level, 15th level, and 19th level. You gain an additional moderate
Metamagic option at 10th and 19th level. When you gain a level in this
class, you can replace one Metamagic option with another of the same
degree, instead of replacing a spell.]

[You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,
unless otherwise noted.]

### Minor Metamagic 

Delayed Spell.[ When you ready a spell, you can spend 1
sorcery point. The spell can be held for up to 1 minute, instead of
until the start of your next turn.]

Distant Spell[. When you cast a spell that has a range
listed in feet, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of a
spell. If you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1
sorcery point to make the range of the spell 20 feet.]

Persistent Spell[. When you cast a spell that has a
duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double
the duration, to a maximum of 24 hours.]

Reliable Spell.[ When you roll a 4 or lower on
a spell attack, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the attack. If
you do, you must use the new result. You can use Reliable Spell even if
you have already used a different Metamagic option on the spell.]{.c6
.c7}

Subdual Spell[. When damage from one of your spells reduces
one or more creatures to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and
spend 1 sorcery point to stabilize one of the creatures knocked
unconscious by it.]

Subtle Spell.[ You can spend 1 sorcery point to
cast a spell without vocalized or seen components.]

Treacherous Spell.[ When you cast a spell, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to alter its components in subtle ways. A
creature attempting to identify the spell based on its components
perceives it as a different spell of your choice of the same or lower
level. Attempts to interrupt this spell via
]counterspell are made at disadvantage.

### Moderate Metamagic 

Careful Spell.[ When you cast a spell with an
Iinstantaneous duration that affects an area, you can spend 1 sorcery
point. If you do, choose a number of creatures in the area up to your
Charisma modifier (minimum one creature). Creatures you choose are
unaffected by the spell.]

Empowered Spell.[ When you roll a spell's damage, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of one).  If you do, you must use the new
rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a
different Metamagic option on the spell.]

Heightened Spell.[ When a creature makes a saving throw to
avoid or resist the effects of a spell you cast, you can spend 3 sorcery
points to give that target disadvantage on its initial saving throw
against the spell.]

Quickened Spell.[ When you cast a spell with a casting time
of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast it as a bonus action
instead.]

Reflexive Spell.[ Immediately before rolling initiative,
you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast a spell of up to 3rd-level that
has a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action. The spell activates
before any other actions in initiative, but doing so uses your action
for your first turn in the combat.]

Refracting Spell.[ When you cast a spell that involves a
spell attack roll and targets only a single creature, you can spend an
additional 2 sorcery points. If the spell hits, a creature within 5 feet
of the original target takes half the spell's damage.]

Twinned Spell. [When you target a
creature with a spell that can target only one creature at the level it
is cast and doesn't have a range of Self, you can spend a number of
sorcery points equal to the spell's level (minimum 1) to target a second
creature within range with the same spell.]

## Ability Score Improvement 

[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]

## Arcane Innovations 

[At 4th level, you gain an arcane innovation of your choice. Your arcane
innovations are detailed at the end of the class description. The
Innovations Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you gain
additional innovations.]

## Arcane Refinement 

At 6th level, choose one of the following.

### Deep Source 

[When you finish a short rest, you can expend a number of Hit Dice up to
your Charisma modifier to regain some of your magic essence. For each
Hit Die you expend, you regain 2 sorcery points. Once you have used this
feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.]

### Patient Aptitude 

[Choose a number of spells with the ritual tag equal to your Charisma
modifier. These spells need not be from the sorcerer spell list, but
they must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can cast
these spells as rituals, though you don't gain the ability to cast them
normally with spell slots. The spells don't count toward your spells
known. If you increase your Charisma modifier, the number of ritual
spells you know also increases. Each time you gain a sorcerer level, you
can replace one of these ritual spells with another eligible spell.]{.c6
.c7}

### Prodigious Innovator 

[You learn three cantrips from any spell list. These cantrips don't
count toward your cantrips known.]

## Rapturous Presence 

At 9th level, choose one of the following.

### Larger Than Life 

[You have advantage on Intimidation checks made to threaten someone with
your magic. On a failure, your target is unconvinced, and unless you
make good on your threat, this feature no longer functions until you
prove your reputation again. Additionally, features and traits that
attempt to evaluate how tough you are, such as the fighter's Size Up,
always give the impression that you are more dangerous than you actually
are.]

### Nobody's Fool 

[You gain a bonus to Insight checks equal to your Charisma modifier. In
addition, you can spend 1 sorcery point as an action to project a
magical aura of honesty. For the next 10 minutes, creatures within 10
feet of you have disadvantage on Deception checks made to lie or conceal
the truth. When a creature in this aura fails a Deception check, it
accidentally blurts out something it didn't mean to while attempting to
spin its lie.]

### Otherworldly 

[Select three of the following creature types: aberration, celestial,
dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead. You have advantage on Charisma
checks to make a first impression on a creature of one of your chosen
types, and if you do not share a common language, you can still
communicate some simple concepts to them such as "friendly," "help," and
"run." In addition, by spending 2 sorcery points and 1 minute in
meditation, you can change your creature type to one of the chosen
creature types. This transformation lasts for 1 hour or until you repeat
the meditation and spend 2 sorcery points to reverse it.]

## Evolving Manifestation 

[At 12th level, you gain the improved form of the manifestation you
selected at 2nd level. Alternatively, you can choose an additional
manifestation from the Manifestation list.]

### Evolving Blizzard 

[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals cold damage,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain 1d6 temporary hit points per level
of the spell. While you have these temporary hit points, whenever a
creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, that creature takes 1d10
cold damage. The temporary hit points last 1 hour.]

### Evolving Corrosion 

[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals acid damage,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to create a 10-foot-radius pool of acid
centered on either the target of the spell or the spell's point of
origin. The area becomes difficult terrain, and whenever a creature ends
its turn in the area, it takes 2d8 acid damage. The pool remains for 1
minute or until you use a bonus action to dismiss it.]

### Evolving Hurricane 

[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals lightning or
thunder damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to create a 15-foot-radius
storm centered on you. The storm moves with you when you move. The area
of the storm is heavily obscured and counts as difficult terrain, but
you can see and move through it normally. At the end of each of your
subsequent turns, you can spend an additional sorcery point to maintain
the storm. Otherwise, it dissipates.]

### Evolving Inferno 

[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher that deals fire damage,
you can spend 1 sorcery point to store some of the spell's energy as a
flame you hold in one hand. You can use an action to throw this flame,
making a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 30
feet. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage per level of the
spell you cast to trigger this effect. The flame lasts for up to 1
minute or until it is thrown.]

### Evolving Venom 

[When you cast a spell that deals poison damage, you can spend 1 sorcery
point and choose one creature you can see. If that creature takes poison
damage from the spell, it takes 2d6 ongoing poison damage for 1 minute
or until a creature uses an action to treat the poison by making a
Medicine check against your spell save DC.]

## Major Metamagic 

[At 15th level, in addition to a minor metamagic option, you gain one
major metamagic option. You gain an additional major metamagic option at
20th level.]

### Major Metamagic Options 

Consumptive Spell. [When you cast a spell that deals
damage, you can spend 4 sorcery points. You or a creature you can see
within 10 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the spell's
damage roll. If you roll the spell's damage multiple times, you only
restore hit points from the first roll.]

Contingent Spell. [When you cast a
spell, rather than have it go off immediately, you can spend 6 sorcery
points and describe an external condition. If that condition occurs
before you finish a long rest, you can use your reaction to trigger the
spell. You can have only one Contingent Spell at a time.]

Echo Spell. [When you cast a spell of
5th-level or lower, you can spend sorcery points equal to the sorcery
point conversion cost for a spell slot of that level (see Table:
Creating Spell Slots). The spell repeats on the next turn, originating
from the same point and aimed at the same target as the first instance
of the spell.]

Intense Spell.[ When you cast a spell that
deals damage, before rolling damage or determining the result of any of
the spell's attack rolls or saving throws, you can spend sorcery points
equal to the spell's level. If you do, the spell deals its maximum
possible damage to one target.]

## Arcane Clutch 

[Starting at 20th level, you can reclaim some fraction of the energies
you expend as you cast. Whenever you cast a spell of 3rd-level or
higher, you regain sorcery points equal to one-third of the expended
spell slot's level.]

## Explosive Magics 

[Also at 20th level, the magic you bring to bear can be made to build
upon itself. When you cast a spell of 4th-level or lower that deals
damage, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to half the
spell's level (minimum 1) to reroll any dice that have the maximum
result and add them to the total. For example, if you cast an exploding
]fireball[ and roll three 6s among your damage dice, you
roll an additional 3d6 and continue rerolling any 6s, adding them to the
total damage dealt.]

# Arcane Innovations 

[When you gain access to a new arcane innovation, choose one of the
following.]

## Draw Nourishment 

[You can spend 3 sorcery points before eating a pound of just about
anything organic---bark, grass, cactus flesh, bone, whatever's at
hand---and so long as you can stomach the taste, it counts as 1 Supply
for you as your body transmutes it into something more edible. A
poisonous substance consumed in this way is still poisonous.]

## Hot Air 

[Any time you have sorcery points remaining, your weight is reduced by
half, and you take half damage from falling. Additionally, if you are
carrying less than a quarter of your maximum equipment load, you float
on water.]

## Lingering Touch 

[When you encounter a shed piece of a creature (such as a lock of hair,
a bloody bandage, a scale, or a tooth), you can touch that object and
instantly attune to it as if it were a magic item. While you are attuned
to the object, when you see the creature from which it originated, you
immediately know that it belongs to that creature, at which point the
attunement ends. At the Narrator's discretion, you might learn
additional cryptic information as a result of being attuned to such
things.]



## Mage Hunter 

[When tracking a creature that can cast at least one spell, you can
focus on the mystic energy it leaves in its wake, allowing you to use
your Charisma for any ability checks made to track it.]

## Magnetic Step 

[You can move along vertical surfaces at half your Sspeed without
needing to make an ability check. If you end your turn on such a
surface, you immediately fall unless you have some other way to support
yourself.]



## Retrace 

[By spending 1 minute in meditation, you can reflect on the magical aura
you leave behind as you travel. After doing so, you can perfectly
retrace the steps you've taken in the past 4 hours.]

## Strange Traces 

[While traveling, you can spend 1 sorcery point to obscure your trail.
For the next hour, any tracks your group leaves become random,
zigzagging, and incomprehensible. Creatures have disadvantage on
Survival checks to track you and become lost on a failed check.]{.c6
.c7}

## Ominous Insight 

[When you fail an Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check, you can
draw on your magics to find an answer and reroll the check. On a
failure, your attempt clouds your mind and you have disadvantage on
Intelligence checks until you finish a rest. While your mind remains
clouded, you can't use Ominous Insight again.]

## Wode Sense 

[While traveling, any time you enter illusory terrain or magic causes
you to become lost, you notice within 1 minute of being affected.]{.c6
.c7}

# Sorcerer Archetypes 

## Sorcerer Archetype Spells 

[You know additional spells from your sorcerer archetype. At 1st level,
choose one spell from the 1st-level row of your archetype's Archetype
Spells table and add it to your spell list. It does not count against
your total spells known. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, choose an
additional spell from a row on the table equal to or lower than your
sorcerer level. When you gain a level, you can replace one of your
archetype spells with an archetype spell of equal or lower level.]{.c6
.c7}

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

### Draconic Toughness 

[At 1st level when you choose this archetype, your hit point maximum
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain a sorcerer
level. Also, when you are unarmored, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity
modifier. ]

### Voice of the Dragon 

[Also at 1st level, you understand the language of dragons. You can
speak, sign, read, and write Draconic. You have advantage on Charisma
checks made to influence the behavior of dragons, so long as you
converse with them in their native tongue.]

### Lord Among Beasts and Mortals 

[Starting at 6th level, when you start a rest in an area that isn't
within 1 mile of an established settlement, you can spend 10 minutes in
communion with the land to protect your camp until you finish your rest.
Beasts who approach within 100 feet of your camp become docile and
placid, refusing to attack you or your companions. Additionally,
friendly creatures in your camp gain advantage on Perception checks to
spot danger, as well as on Intimidation checks against intruders.]{.c6
.c7}

[If you repeat this effect every day in the same location for a year,
the radius of the effect increases to 500 feet, and the effect becomes
permanent. When you have a permanent lair, your Prestige increases by an
amount equal to half your proficiency bonus. You can have only one
permanent lair at a time, and the effect fades if you are ever away from
your lair for a year or longer. If you die, the effect fades after 2d10
days.]

### Soaring Wings 

[Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to sprout dragon
wings. The wings grant you a flying speed equal to your Speed. You can
dismiss these wings as a bonus action. You can't manifest the wings
while wearing armor, unless the armor has been specially modified for
that purpose (increasing its cost by 50 percent). The wings tear
clothing that is not similarly modified.]

### Draconic Presence 

[Starting at 18th level, you can use an action and spend 5 sorcery
points to exude a 60-foot aura of your choice of awe or fear. For 1
minute, when a hostile creature starts its turn in this aura it makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it becomes charmed (in an awe aura)
or frightened (in a fear aura) until the aura ends. The creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving
throw is immune to your Draconic Presence for 24 hours.]

  ----------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deeper Understanding 

[Starting at 1st level when you choose this archetype, you gain an
expertise die on ability checks made to identify spells being cast or
sense the presence of lingering magic in any form.]

### Reach Beyond 

[Also at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to attempt to replace one
of your archetype spells. Declare which spell you're trying to replace
and make a Charisma saving throw (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a
success, you replace the spell with another archetype spell of the same
or lower level until you finish a long rest, at which point the original
spell returns to your spell list. This newly gained spell can't be
replaced again.]

[On a failure, the new spell isn't added to your spell list, and you
inadvertently cast the spell you're attempting to replace, expending no
spell slots but targeting a creature or point within range of the
Narrator's choice (possibly yourself). The spell is too wild to alter
with metamagic, and if it requires concentration it instead lasts its
full duration with no concentration required. The archetype spell you
attempted to replace is then removed from your spell list until you
finish a long rest, at which point it returns.]

### Retributive Surge 

[At 6th level, when a creature you can see damages you, you can use your
reaction to cast a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. The spell must either target
the creature that damaged you or be centered on a space it occupies. The
spell must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, and you
must spend sorcery points equal to the spell's level, in addition to the
spell slot you used to cast the spell.]

[At 14th and 18th level, the highest level of spell you can cast in this
way increases by 1.]

### Tenuous Serenity 

[At 14th level, when you make a Charisma saving throw, you can spend 1
sorcery point to add an expertise die to the roll, or to reroll an
expertise die used in the roll. You can do so after seeing the result of
the saving throw.]

[Additionally, when you finish a short rest, select a spell that's been
removed from your spell list by one of your class features. You reclaim
the spell. Once you've used this feature to reclaim a lost spell, you
can't do so again until you finish a long rest.]

### Erupting Nova 

[At 18th level, you can cast two spells simultaneously, expending spell
slots for each, so long as both spells have a casting time of 1 action,
the sum of their levels is less than 6, and neither spell requires
concentration. When you do so, make a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the
sum of the spells' levels). On a failure, you waste your action (but not
any spell slots) and both spells are removed from your spell list until
you finish a long rest.]

## Traveler

.c7}

[In addition, you can use Charisma when making an ability check to
navigate, survive in, or remember information about planes of existence
other than the Material Plane.]

### Flutter 

[Also at 1st level, after you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you
can teleport a short distance to an unoccupied space you can see. The
maximum range of this teleportation is equal to 5 feet + 5 feet per
level of the spell.]

### Gift of Impermanence 

[Starting at 6th level, once per round when you fail a saving throw
against an effect that would cause you to become grappled,
incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, or stunned, you can
spend 1 sorcery point, and reroll one d20 used in the saving throw.]{.c6
.c7}

### All Terrains 

At 14th level, choose one of the following boons:

-   You ignore difficult terrain.
-   [You ignore the effects of extreme heat, extreme cold, and high
    altitude.]
-   You gain a swim speed equal to your Speed.
-   [You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on
    ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.]
-   [You can spend 1 sorcery point to gain a fly speed equal to your
    Speed for 1 hour.]

[When you finish a long rest, you can replace your active boon with a
different boon from this list.]

### Touch the Void 

[At 18th level, you can spend 1 hour in meditation to cast
]astral projection, dream, or etherealness[.
Each of these spells is slightly different when cast using this feature,
as described below:]

Astral Projection.[ The spell requires no material
components, but it only affects you.]

Dream.[ You are the messenger in the dream, and while you
are influencing the dream you are unaware of your surroundings.]{.c6
.c7}

Etherealness.[ When the spell ends, you reappear in the
space you were in when you originally cast the spell.]

[Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish
a long rest.]

## Warlock Archetype 

[At 1st level, you have reached out to, stumbled upon, or otherwise
crossed paths with a powerful entity beyond the ken of mortals, an
otherworldly patron who sets you on the path of a Warlock Archetype.
Your choice of archetype grants you an expanded spell list and
additional features at 1st, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.]

## Pact Magic 

[With care, practice, and dedication you have learned to siphon and
channel the otherworldly powers you've gained from your patron.]{.c6
.c7}

### Cantrips 

[You learn two warlock cantrips of your choice at 1st level and
additional warlock cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Warlock table.  If you gain a bonus cantrip, it
doesn't count against your cantrips known.]

### Spell Points 

[The Warlock table shows how many spell points you have. To cast one of
your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must spend a number of
spell points dependent on the spell's level, as shown on the table
below. You can also cast a spell you know at a higher spell level by
expending the appropriate number of spell points. The maximum spell
level you can cast is shown in the Spell Level column of the Warlock
table. You regain all expended spell points when you finish a rest.]{.c6
.c7}

TABLE: SPELL POINTS

  -------------------------- ---------------------------
  SPELL LEVEL   SPELL POINTS
  1st             2
  2nd             3
  3rd             5
  4th             6
  5th             7
  -------------------------- ---------------------------

### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher 

[You know your choice of two 1st-level warlock spells, and you learn
more according to the Spells Known column of the Warlock table. Each of
these spells must be of a level that you are able to cast. For instance,
when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new 1st- or
2nd-level spell.]

[Additionally, when you gain a warlock level, you can replace one
warlock spell you know with another warlock spell, which also must be of
a level you can cast.]

[If you gain a bonus spell, it doesn't count against your spells
known.]

### Spellcasting Ability 

[Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as your spellcasting ability.
Once you make this choice, you can't change it. You use the chosen
ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use that ability modifier to set the saving throw DC for
your warlock spells and spell attack rolls, as follows:]

Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen
ability modifier]

Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your
chosen ability modifier]

### Spellcasting Focus 

[When casting a warlock spell, you can use an arcane focus as your
spellcasting focus.]

## Eldritch Blast 

At 1st level, choose one of the following features.

### Eldritch Disturbance 

[You can use an action to strike a creature you can see within 60 feet
with a reality-distorting curse, blending pain both mental and physical.
The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 1d10 force damage on a
failure, or half damage on a success.]

### Eldritch Ray 

[You can use an action to create a deadly beam that strikes a creature
within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature,
dealing 1d10 force damage on a hit.]

### Eldritch Scythe 

[Once per turn when you would make a melee weapon attack as part of the
Attack action or an opportunity attack, you can instead make a melee
spell attack, lashing out with an ephemeral and unearthly blade. On hit,
the target takes 1d8 force damage. In addition, you can choose a
creature that you can see and that is within your reach. That creature
takes half as much damage.]

### Eldritch Whip 

[You can use an action to thrash a creature with a scintillating tendril
of arcane force. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 15
feet, dealing 1d6 force damage on a hit.]

[At the end of your turn you gain temporary hit points equal to half the
damage you dealt with Eldritch Whip this turn (minimum 1). These
temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn. When you hit
a creature with your Eldritch Whip and you already have temporary hit
points, you can end the temporary hit points early to gain a bonus to
the Eldritch Whip's damage roll equal to half the temporary hit points
you ended early.]

## Eldritch Invocations 



[You gain an eldritch invocation of your choice at 2nd level and
additional invocations at higher warlock levels, as shown in the
Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.]

[Additionally, when you gain a warlock level, you can replace one of the
invocations you know with another invocation that you could learn at
that level. If you gain a bonus invocation, it doesn't count against
your Invocations known.]

Extra Secrets of Arcana.[ Whenever you would learn a new
invocation in this way, you can learn a secret of arcana instead.]{.c6
.c7}

## Secrets of Arcana 

[Also at 2nd level, you gain a secret of arcana of your choice. Your
secrets are detailed at the end of the class description. The Secrets
Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more secrets of
arcana.]

## Pact Boon 

At 3rd level, choose one of the following features.

### Pact of the Blade 

[You can use your action to conjure in your empty hand an armament
bestowed with power: a pact weapon. Choose any simple or martial weapon
when you conjure your pact weapon. You are proficient with your pact
weapon while you wield it, and you can use your spellcasting ability for
attack and damage rolls with it. This weapon counts as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. Your pact weapon
disappears if it is more than 5 feet away for 1 minute, if you die, if
you use this feature again, or if you dismiss the weapon (no action
required).]

[By performing a 1-hour ritual while holding a magic weapon or rare
weapon (but not an artifact or sentient weapon), you can transform it
into your pact weapon. If this weapon has a bonus to attack or damage
rolls, or if it deals bonus damage, you can apply these to your Eldritch
Blast (a ranged weapon adds these bonuses to Eldritch Ray, and a melee
weapon adds them to Eldritch Scythe; the weapon has no effect on
Eldritch Disturbance or Eldritch Whip). The weapon disappears into an
extradimensional space when not used, and it appears whenever you
conjure your pact weapon. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if
you die, if you perform the ritual on a different weapon, or if you
perform the ritual to break your bond to the weapon. The weapon is
collected by your patron if the bond breaks while it is in the
extradimensional space.]

### Pact of the Chain 

You learn the find familiar[ spell as a bonus spell, and
you can cast it as a ritual. When you cast the spell, in addition to the
normal forms you can choose, you can choose an imp, pseudodragon,
quasit, sprite, or any Tiny creature of CR 1/2 or less. You can also opt
for the spirit you call forth to be of the aberration, elemental, or
undead type.]

[When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks to
allow your familiar to make one attack using its reaction. Additionally,
when you use Eldritch Scythe, you can choose to make the attack through
your familiar as though you had cast a spell with a range of Touch.]{.c6
.c7}

### Pact of the Tome 

[You awaken to find a grimoire left in your pack by your patron: a Book
of Shadows. Choose three bonus cantrips. While the book is in your
possession, you know these cantrips and they are treated as warlock
spells. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour
ritual to receive a replacement from your patron, destroying the
previous book. The book is collected by your patron when you die.]{.c6
.c7}

## Ability Score Improvement 

[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]

## Invocation of the Courts 

[Also at 4th level, you gain a bonus invocation. Choose one invocation
from the following list: Beguiling Influence, Courts of the Outer
Realms, Eyes of the Runekeeper, Gaze of Two Minds, Mask of Many Faces,
Ominous Tormentor, Psionic Secrecy, Spellbinding Contract, Voice of the
Chain Master, Whispers of the Grave.]

[You gain another bonus invocation at 10th level and again at 16th
level. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
bonus invocations you gained in this way and replace it with another
bonus invocation from the list.]

## Extra Blast 

[Starting at 5th level, when you use Eldritch Ray, Eldritch Scythe, or
Eldritch Whip as your action on your turn, you can attack twice instead
of once, provided you make no weapon attacks. At 11th level you can make
three attacks, and at 17th level you can make four attacks.]

[In addition, your Eldritch Disturbance damage increases by 1d10 at 5th
level, and again at 11th level and 17th level (to a maximum of
4d10).]

[These benefits are based on your warlock level, not your character
level. This feature otherwise counts as Extra Attack (for the purpose of
qualifying for feats, spell effects, and the like).]

## Eldritch Evolution 

[At 6th level, you gain a bonus invocation---one that represents your
growth in the lethal lore behind Eldritch Blast. Choose one invocation
from the following list: Agonizing Blast, Eldritch Bind, Eldritch
Elementalism, Eldritch Grasp, Eldritch Prism, Eldritch Riposte, Eldritch
Severance, Eldritch Spear, Eldritch Squall, Eldritch Tentacle, Repelling
Blast, Versatile Blast.]

[You gain another bonus invocation at 12th level and again at 18th
level. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
bonus invocations you gained in this way and replace it with another
bonus invocation from the list.]

## Dread Thaumaturge 

[At 20th level, you have learned all you can from your patron. You gain
the following abilities.]

### Aura of Anathema 

[Creatures you choose gain vulnerability to necrotic damage while within
120 feet of you. A creature with resistance to necrotic damage instead
loses its resistance, and a creature immune to necrotic damage instead
replaces that immunity with resistance.]

[Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose a different damage type
for your aura.]

### Highest Arcanum 

[You learn an ultimate exploit in the laws of magic. Choose one of the
following:]

-   Once between rests, you can cast plane shift[ without
    material components.]
-   You are under the constant effects of the [foresight
    ][spell. This effect can't be detected or dispelled by any
    means short of a ]wish spell.
-   [You can spend 1 minute in arcane contemplation to regain all
    expended spell points. Once you have used this feature, you must
    finish a long rest before you can do so again.]

    component pouch, flask of oil, lantern (hooded), mess tin,
    spellbook]

## Spellcasting 

[At 1st level you have a spellbook containing the written spells you
study. You use your spellbook to cast your spells.]

### Cantrips 

[You learn three wizard cantrips of your choice at 1st level and
additional wizard cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Wizard Spells table. Additionally, you know the
]prestidigitation cantrip.

### Spellbook 

[At 1st level, your spellbook contains six 1st-level wizard spells of
your choice. Your spellbook contains all of the wizard spells you know,
except your cantrips, which you maintain in your memory.]

### Preparing and Casting Spells 

[To prepare wizard spells to make them available to cast, choose a
number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence
modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). You can't prepare a
spell with a higher level than your highest-level spell slot.]

[To cast a wizard spell, you must spend a spell slot of the spell's
level or higher. The Wizard Spells table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your wizard spells. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.]

[Casting spells doesn't remove them from your list of prepared
spells.]

[During a long rest, you can change your list of prepared spells by
studying your spellbook.]

### Spellcasting Ability 

[Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You
use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier to set the
saving throw DC for your wizard spells and spell attack rolls, as
follows:]

Spell save DC[ = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier]

Spell attack modifier[ = your proficiency bonus + your
Intelligence modifier]

### Ritual Casting 

[You can cast a wizard spell in your spellbook as a ritual if that spell
can be cast as a ritual.]

### Spellcasting Focus 

[When casting a wizard spell, you can use an arcane focus as your
spellcasting focus.]

### Learning Spells of 1st-Level and Higher 

[Whenever you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your
choice to your spellbook for free. You can't prepare a spell with a
higher level than your highest-level spell slot.]

### Your Spellbook 

[As you research magic and spells, you will add new spells to your
spellbook. ]

  Copying a Spell into the Book[. When you find a
wizard spell of 1st-level or higher in a scroll or spellbook, you can
add it to your spellbook if its level isn't higher than your
highest-level spell slot. Doing so costs 2 hours and 50 gp per spell
level.]

  Replacing the Book[. You can copy a spell you know into
another spellbook, in case you want to share a spell, create a backup
copy of your spellbook, or replace a lost spellbook. Copying a spell you
know costs only 1 hour and 10 gp per spell level.]

## Arcane Recovery 

[Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover expended
spell slots with a combined level equal to or less than half your wizard
level (rounded up). You can't recover a 6th-level or higher spell
slot.]

## Wizard Archetype 

[At 2nd level, you choose a tradition of magic that you have dedicated
your studies to. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.]

## Scholarly Excellence 

At 3rd level, choose one of the following:

### Academic 

[You gain four specialties from Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History,
Nature, and Religion. Unlike normal specialties, academic specialties
can be taken twice (increasing the specialty's expertise die to
1d6).]

[In addition, when you use either Deception or Persuasion to make a
point related to one of your academic specialties, you can apply your
expertise die from that specialty to the check, and you can use
Intelligence the check.]

### Ritual Efficiency 

[When you cast a spell as a ritual, you add only 1 minute to the casting
time (instead of 10 minutes).]

### Rote Memorization 

[Choose one cantrip you know that has a casting time of 1 action and
doesn't deal damage. You can cast that cantrip as a bonus action without
any seen or material components a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you
finish a long rest. Each time you gain a wizard level, you can change
the cantrip associated with this feature each time with another eligible
cantrip you know.]

## Elective Studies 

[At 4th level you gain one elective study of your choice. Elective
studies are detailed at the end of the class description. The Studies
Known column of the Wizard table shows when you learn more elective
studies. Unless otherwise noted, you can gain each study only once.]{.c6
.c7}

## Ability Score Improvement 

[At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability
score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.]

## Signature Spells 

[At 5th level, you have developed your spellcasting skill and honed it
into spells that you consider to be your Signature Spells.]

[Choose one 1st-level wizard spell that is in your spellbook. You always
have this spell prepared, it doesn't count toward your maximum prepared
spells. In addition, once per rest you can cast this spell at its lowest
level without expending a spell slot.]

[At higher levels, you gain additional Signature Spells, each of which
you can cast once between rests. At 11th level, you can choose one
2nd-level or lower Signature Spell. At 17th level, you can choose one
3rd-level or lower Signature Spell. Each time you gain a level in this
class, you can replace one of your Signature Spells with another of the
same level or lower.]

## Spell Study 

[At 7th level, choose one Spell Study that reflects what you have
dedicated your arcane studies to.]

### Arcane Objects 

[When you touch a magic item, either willingly or when you are hit by
it, you are immediately aware that it's magical. If you hold such an
item in your hand, you can cast ]identify[ on it as an
action without expending a spell slot, even if you don't have the spell
prepared.]

In addition, when you cast identify[ using a spell slot
or as a ritual, you also learn if the item is cursed, and the Narrator
will give you a hint as to the curse's effects (which might be cryptic
and vague, but must not be a lie).]

### Detective Spell Study 

[You automatically sense the presence of magical effects, such as a
spell effect on an object or a spell effect in an area, within 20 feet.
You don't know what the effects are or where they are located, only that
such effects are near you.]

In addition, you have honed your detection spells. Add [detect
magic] and detect thoughts[ to your spellbook if
they weren't already there. Whenever you cast ][detect
magic][, the range in which you can sense magic increases to 60
feet. Whenever you cast ]detect thoughts[, the range in
which you can read thoughts increases to 60 feet.]

### Fauna and Flora 

[Your research into plants, wildlife, and the natural workings of magic
grants you superior insights into the magic of living creatures and
flora. When a beast or plant makes a saving throw against a spell you
cast, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.]

## Wizard's Flair 

[At 9th level, choose a flair from the options below. When you finish a
long rest, you can replace your flair with another.]

[Once per rest, when you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can
choose to cast it with your flair. You must choose whether to cast with
flair when you declare you're casting the spell, before any rolls are
made.]

### Awe and Wonder 

[Choose one creature affected by the spell. It must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn. While
charmed in this way, it is incapacitated, has a Speed of 0, and does
nothing but stare blankly at the dazzling effects of your magic. The
effect ends early if the target takes damage or is forced to make a
saving throw.]

### Terror 

[Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the
spell. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or becomes frightened of
you until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, it
starts its turn by using its full movement to get away from you in the
most direct manner possible, avoiding obvious hazards along the
way.]

### Brilliance 

[Choose one creature within 30 feet that can see you when you cast the
spell. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be
blinded until the end of its next turn.]

### Warding 

[After casting the spell, until the start of your next turn, a creature
who attempts to attack you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failure, it must choose a new target or waste its attack.]

## Bestow Magics 

[At 13th level, you can transfer your magic to another creature. To do
so, you must touch a willing creature, expend a spell slot of 3rd-level
or lower, and concentrate for 1 minute. At the end of this time, choose
a spell you have prepared of the expended spell slot's level or lower.
The creature can cast the spell using the slot you expended, following
its normal rules for casting time, spell components, range, and
concentration, but using your spellcasting ability modifier, spell
attack modifier, and spell save DC. You can have only one spell imbued
at a time. If you bestow a spell upon a different creature, the spell
slot remains expended and the previous spell dissipates, its magic
unspent.]

## Arcane Defenses 

[At 15th level, your training has granted you certain protections
against magic. Choose one of the following:]

### Mental Discipline 

[Once per rest, when you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.]

### Mystic Mantle 

[You and creatures within 10 feet have resistance to damage dealt by
spells.]

### Superior Countermagic 

[When you make an ability check as part of casting
]counterspell or dispel magic[, you add your
proficiency bonus to the roll.]

[In addition, when you cast either of these spells, treat the spell slot
level of the spell as one level higher than the actual slot you spent.
The slot you use to cast the spell must still be at least
3rd-level.]

## Spell Intensity 

[At 18th level, choose one of the following features, which can be used
to augment your wizard spells of 5th-level or lower. You must choose
whether to augment the spell when you declare you're casting it, before
any rolls are made.]

[The first time you use this feature to augment a spell, you suffer no
adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long
rest, your hit point maximum and current hit points are reduced by 1d12
per level of the spell you augmented (cantrips count as 1st-level spells
for this purpose). This reduction lasts until you finish a long
rest.]

### Binding 

[After you have affected a creature with a spell that has a duration and
it is able to end the spell's effect on itself with a successful saving
throw, it must succeed on that saving throw twice to end the
effect.]

### Burn 

[Any creature that takes damage from the spell takes that damage again
at the start of your next turn, unless a ][dispel
magic][ spell of any level is cast on it before then or if it's in
an ]antimagic field at the time.

### Chain 

[If the spell you cast normally targets only a single creature, it can
also target up to two more creatures within 15 feet of the initial
target.]

### Duality 

[If the spell you cast requires concentration and you're already
concentrating on another spell, you can maintain concentration on both
spells simultaneously. If you're forced to make a Constitution saving
throw to maintain concentration, the minimum DC is 10 + the combined
levels of the two spells. On a failure, both spells end.]

### Overchannel 

[Instead of rolling damage, you instead deal maximum damage with the
spell.]

## Swift Signature 

[At 19th level, when you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1
action using your Signature Spell feature, you can cast it as a bonus
action instead.]

## Archmage 

At 20th level, you gain the following features.

### Magesight 

[You can't be blinded, and you can see normally in all types of darkness
(including magical) to a distance of 120 feet.]

[When you see a creature use Spellcasting to cast a spell, you
instinctively know what spell is being cast before the casting is
complete. This doesn't tell you what level spell slot is being used to
cast the spell.]

### True Magician 

[You can cast any 1st-level wizard spell you have prepared without
expending a spell slot.]

# Elective Studies 

[When you gain access to a new elective study, choose one of the
following. Some studies have prerequisites, such as minimum wizard
level, or another study. You must meet those requirements before you can
choose that study.]

## Air Lift 

[You can use an action to increase your vertical jump distance to 15
feet until the end of your turn. When you jump in this way, you can also
glide with the updraft, allowing you to move 10 feet horizontally for
every 5 feet you descend vertically.]

## Detect Magic Savant 

Prerequisite: Able to cast detect magic

Whenever you cast detect magic[, you can choose one of
the following benefits to amplify the spell.]

Lengthened Detect Magic. The duration of [detect
magic] increases by 10 minutes.

Extended Detect Magic[. The detection radius of
]detect magic increases by 30 feet.

Penetrating Detect Magic[. The spell is only blocked by 2
feet of stone, 2 inches of common metal, a 1-inch sheet of lead, or 6
feet of wood or dirt.]

## Eidetic Memory 

[Your memory is nearly perfect. You can accurately recall anything
you've read or seen in the past month. Additionally, when retreading a
route you've traveled in the past month, you have advantage on ability
checks made against environmental hazards on that route, unless the
landscape has significantly changed.]

## Illusion Detective 

Prerequisite: At least one illusion spell in your spellbook.

[You have advantage on Investigation checks and Intelligence saving
throws made against illusions. When you succeed on an ability check or
saving throw to see through an illusion, creatures you choose within 30
feet gain advantage on checks to see through that illusion for the next
minute.]

## Loremaster of Creatures 

[When you gain this study, choose one creature type: beasts, constructs,
dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, oozes, plants, or undead. This
creature type becomes your Loremaster Creature Specialty. When you
encounter a creature of the same type as your Loremaster Creature
Specialty, you automatically know any history, legends, or myths related
to it.]

## Loremaster of Travel 

[You have advantage on History checks to recall information related to
myths and legends that are location-based. In addition, when you arrive
at a settlement for the first time, choose one of the following
subjects: culture, etiquette, government, or populace. The Narrator will
give you a useful fact about that subject. You gain an expertise die on
ability checks related to that subject in this settlement.]

## Persistent Mending 

Prerequisite: The ability to cast mending

[When you finish a long rest, choose up to six creatures who rested with
you, including yourself. Choose one piece of their equipment to enchant
with a persistent mending effect. The chosen item instantly fixes itself
if it becomes damaged. If you choose an item from the following list, it
also grants an additional benefit. This effect lasts for 12 hours.]{.c6
.c7}

Coat.[ Choose either cold or hot weather. The creature
gains an expertise die on Constitution saving throws made to resist the
effects of that kind of weather.]

Goggles.[ The creature's vision can never be reduced to
less than 20 feet due to inclement weather.]

Shoes.[ The creature gains an expertise die on Constitution
saving throws made to undertake a forced march.]

## Presto, Prestidigitation! 

Prerequisite: The ability to cast prestidigitation

If you are not actively casting prestidigitation[ or
concentrating on a spell, the magic of
]prestidigitation[ is always keeping you, your clothes, and
your gear sparkling clean.]

[The following effects are added to the list of options you can choose
when you cast ]prestidigitation.

-   [You transmute a small piece of string in your hands into a sturdy,
    30-foot-long rope. For the duration, it functions as a regular
    hempen rope.]
-   [Using the heads side of a coin like a lens, you can hold the coin
    over one of your closed eyes and see through it. While looking
    through the coin in this way, you gain darkvision to a range of 30
    feet. The coin's darkvision effect ends when the spell ends.]{.c6
    .c7}
-   [A pebble you touch becomes a sensor that you can use to see
    through. For the duration as long as you are within 10 feet of the
    pebble, you can use an action to see through the pebble to a range
    of 30 feet. While seeing through the pebble, you are blinded and
    deafened with regard to your own senses.]
-   [On a piece of parchment or paper, you can create an exact copy of
    another piece of parchment or paper, including any writing,
    drawings, or other markings that appear on the original. The paper
    does not change size to accommodate any differences in size between
    the two. The copy you create disappears when the spell's duration
    ends.]

# Wizard Archetypes 

## Arcanist 

### Scholarly Specialty 

[When you take this archetype at 2nd level, choose one classical school
of magic as your Scholarly Specialty: abjuration, conjuration,
divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, or
transmutation. The gold and time you must spend to copy spells from this
school into your spellbook is halved. If a feature refers to your chosen
school, it refers to the school selected in this feature.]

### Esoteric Talent 

Also at 2nd level, you gain one of the following benefits:

#### Bend Magic 

[When you cast a wizard spell with an instantaneous duration that deals
damage to an area, you can choose a number of creatures in the area that
you can see equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one creature).
The chosen creatures take no damage from the spell.]

#### Flash of Insight 

[You can use a bonus action to roll a d20, record the result, and choose
a creature you can see within 30 feet. The next time that creature makes
an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, it takes that d20 result
instead of rolling. If you use this feature again before you finish a
short rest, you must expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to do
so.]

#### Quick Step 

[After you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you can
immediately move up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks or
spending any of your normal movement.]

### Refined Learning 

At 6th level, choose one of the following benefits:

#### Arcane Armor 

[When you cast a wizard spell of 1st-level or higher, you store some of
its magic to protect yourself, gaining temporary hit points equal to
twice the level of the spell, or three times the spell's level if the
spell is from your chosen school. Instead of gaining these temporary hit
points yourself, you can use your reaction to grant them to a creature
you can see within 30 feet.]

#### Energy Retention 

[When you expend a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher to cast a wizard
spell from your chosen school, you regain one expended spell slot. The
regained spell slot must be of a level no more than half the level of
the expended spell slot.]

#### War Magic 

[When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school that deals damage,
you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
+1) on the first damage roll for that spell.]

### Superior Talent 

At 10th level, choose one of the following benefits:

#### Perfect Control 

[When concentrating on a wizard spell of your chosen school, you only
need to roll to maintain concentration when you take damage from an
attack, effect, or spell equal to or greater than your Intelligence
score + your wizard level.]

#### Secondary Learning 

[Choose a second school as your Scholarly Specialty and an additional
feature from either Esoteric Talent or Refined Learning.]

[Once per rest, when you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school
that only affects one creature, you can choose to affect an additional
creature within range.]

### Specialized Mastery 

At 14th level, choose one of the following benefits:

#### Battle Hardiness 

[When concentrating on a wizard spell from your chosen school, you
reduce bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage you take by an amount
equal to the level of the spell.]

#### Heightened Potency 

[When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, it is always
treated as though it were cast with a spell slot one level higher
(maximum 9th-level) than the one you used, so long as you expended a
spell slot to cast it. The slot you use to cast the spell must still be
at least equal to the level of the spell.]

#### Precise Understanding 

[When you see a creature cast a spell from your chosen school, you
automatically know what spell it's casting. In addition, you have
advantage on saving throws against spells.]

## Mage 

### Broad Knowledge 

[At 2nd level when you choose this archetype, the cost to copy a spell
into your spellbook is reduced to 40 gp per spell level (instead of 50
gp per level).]

### Flexible Thinking 

[Also at 2nd level, once per rest you can use an action to replace one
spell you have prepared with any other spell in your spellbook.]{.c6
.c7}

### Flux 

[At 6th level, you gain Flux, the ability to bend your magic in
flexible, constantly-changing ways. When you finish a rest, choose one
of the benefits from the following list. You can expend your Flux to use
that benefit.]

[When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can change your
benefit to a different one. If you do, you regain your Flux. Otherwise
you regain your Flux when you finish a rest.]

Ad Hoc Defense.[ When you take damage, you can use your
reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to your proficiency
bonus.]

Elusive.[ You can use a bonus action up to teleport 15 feet
to an unoccupied space you can see.]

Reactive Ward.[ When you make a saving throw, you can use
your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the result (minimum
+1). You can do so after the roll is made, but before any of its effects
are resolved.]

Spell Intensity.[ When you cast a spell that deals damage,
you can increase the spell's first damage roll by an amount equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).]

### Fluent Control 

[At 10th level, you can use your Flexible Thinking feature as a bonus
action (instead of as an action).]

[In addition, you add your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to
Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on
spells.]

### Multitalented 

[At 14th level, when you see a creature cast a spell of a level equal to
or lower than your Intelligence modifier, you automatically know what
spell it is.]

[In addition, choose one Flux effect. You can use the chosen effect
without expending your Flux. When you gain a level in this class, you
can replace the chosen effect with a different Flux effect.]

## Pyromancer 

### Cleansing Fire 

[When you choose this archetype at 2nd level, you learn how to use flame
to heal aw well as harm. When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell of
1st-level or higher that deals fire damage, you can choose one creature
that would take damage from the spell. Instead of taking damage from the
spell, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to the spell's
level plus your proficiency bonus.]

### Rituals of Fire 

[Also at 2nd level, you can spend 10 minutes meditating while staring
into a flame that fills at least a 5-foot cube to cast
]augury without expending a spell slot.

[At 6th level, if you burn an object with a connection to a creature and
spend 10 minutes in meditation, you can cast ][locate
creature] without expending a spell slot.

[At 10th level, once per rest, you can step into a fire large enough to
fully contain you and cast ]dream[ without expending a
spell slot. When you cast ]dream[ in this way, you act as
the spell's messenger. You take no damage from the fire, but if the fire
goes out before you end the spell, you take 4d6 psychic damage and the
spell ends.]

### Clinging Flames 

[At 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals fire damage and forces a
saving throw, creatures that fail their first saving throw against it
take ongoing fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
1). At the start of each of its turns, the creature repeats the saving
throw, ending the ongoing fire damage on a success.]

### Blazing Mastery 

[At 10th level, fire damage from your spells treats immunity to fire
damage as though it were fire resistance, and ignores fire resistance
entirely. Additionally, you gain resistance to fire damage, as well as
immunity to fire damage dealt by your own spells.]

### Offerings in Kind 

[At 14th level, you can seek the aid of higher powers in your time of
need. As an action, you urge the spirits of fire to intervene and roll
1d100. If the result is equal to or lower than your wizard level, the
intervention comes immediately. If not, the spirits make a demand in
turn (which may be a high price) and do not intervene until the price is
paid. The Narrator determines the price, as well as the exact nature of
the intervention, though a wizard spell of any level is usually
appropriate. If intervention occurs, this feature can't be used again
for 7 days. Otherwise, you can try again after a long rest. The scope of
this power is dependent on the Narrator's discretion---for a high enough
price, anything is possible.]

[In addition, you can copy any fire spell into your spellbook as if it
were a wizard spell. Once you do, it is a wizard spell for you.]{.c6
.c7}
