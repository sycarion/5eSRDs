# Origins

# Heritage

## Age

## Size

All creatures are assigned a size, ranging from Tiny to Gargantuan. Medium and Small are the most common sizes for adventurers.

## Speed

Each heritage has a base Speed. This determines how far you can move on your turn during combat and while traveling.

## Darkvision

Creatures with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, out to a certain distance.

## Heritage Gift

In addition to the traits granted to all characters of the same heritage, some include multiple gifts for you to choose from. When multiple options are presented, you may choose only one heritage gift.

# Destinies

## Inspiration

The Narrator awards inspiration, a resource which grants you an edge in important moments, when you roleplay your character according to your destiny. Each destiny has a source of inspiration which describes acts of roleplaying that should be rewarded with inspiration, although it remains at the Narrator’s discretion. Additionally, the Narrator can award inspiration whenever they feel a character has been particularly clever, engaging, or heartfelt in their roleplaying.  
Once you have inspiration, you can save it indefinitely. Whenever you or an ally you can see makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you may spend your inspiration to grant advantage to that roll.  
Alternatively, you can spend inspiration to use the inspiration feature unique to your chosen destiny.  
You either have inspiration or you don’t; if you already have inspiration and do something worth rewarding inspiration, you do not gain a second use of inspiration.

## Fulfilling Your Destiny

Each destiny includes a fulfillment feature that you gain when you achieve your destiny, a momentous event usually at the end of a major story arc in the narrative, indicated by the Narrator. Even if your destiny remains outside of your grasp, it is close enough at hand that you automatically gain its fulfillment feature when you reach 16th level.  
If you fulfill your destiny early in a campaign, at the Narrator’s discretion you may select an additional destiny. You retain your original destiny’s features and gain the source of inspiration and inspiration feature of your new destiny. You cannot gain a second fulfillment feature.

## Changing Your Destiny

Whenever you gain a class level, you may choose to change your destiny. You lose any features provided by your current destiny and select a new destiny, gaining its source of inspiration and inspiration features.

Greatly destabilize a nation or extremely large organization, subvert or trick a deity-level entity, upset the status quo for a vast number of people.

**Inspiration Feature: Selfless Aid.**  
Whenever you take the Help action to aid an ally attacking a creature, you may spend your inspiration. If you do, in addition to the normal benefits of the Help action, that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

**Fulfilling Your Destiny**  
You fulfill your destiny of Devotion when you perform an act of selfless devotion.  
Die while saving the lives of others, complete a massive undertaking personally entrusted to you, succeed at the cause you devoted your life to.  
**Fulfillment Feature: Miraculous Revival.** As long as you have not died of old age, 24 hours after you die (or in 24 hours, if your death triggered gaining this feature) you miraculously revive intact with full hit points. You appear after “narrowly surviving” the circumstances that killed you—climbing out of the chasm you fell down, crawling from the rubble of the structure that collapsed over you, waking up from impossibly lethal wounds that prove superficial, or magically transporting from the plane of existence you were caught in.

You gain inspiration whenever the Narrator calls for you to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the final result of the d20 roll is a natural 1\.

**Inspiration Feature: Unearthly Diplomacy.** As an action, you may spend your inspiration to form a connection with a non-humanoid creature you can see that has a CR equal to or less than your level. You communicate freely, even if you do not share a language or the creature would be normally unable to speak. You have no control over a creature you connect with in this way but you gain an expertise die on checks made to influence it. A creature’s available information is often limited by their own awareness, but most will at least have information regarding events that transpired in the immediate area during the last 24 hours, and nearby prominent creatures or locations.  
This connection lasts for up to 1 hour or until you use an action to end it.

**Fulfilling Your Destiny**
