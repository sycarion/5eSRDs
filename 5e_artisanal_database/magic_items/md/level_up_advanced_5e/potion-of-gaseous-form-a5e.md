# Potion of Gaseous Form

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Potion
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

The pale, translucent liquid in this vial causes the flask to float slightly. After drinking this potion, for the next hour you are affected as if you had cast __gaseous form_ (but without the need for _concentration_ ). You can use a bonus action to end the effect early.
