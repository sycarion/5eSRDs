# Animated Shield

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

As a bonus action, you can verbally command the shield to animate and float in your space, or for it to stop doing so. The shield continues to act as if you were wielding it, but with your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, or until you are _incapacitated_  or die. It then returns to your free hand, if you have one, or else it falls to the ground. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
