This glass bottle is filled with whirling smoke. You can use an action to remove the stopper, causing a thick cloud to pour out and fill a 60-foot radius centered on the bottle, making the area _heavily obscured_ . The cloud grows by 10 feet for each minute that the bottle remains open, to a maximum radius of 120 feet.

The cloud remains until the bottle is closed. Closing the bottle requires the itemâ€™s command word and an action, after which the smoke disperses after 10 minutes. Moderate winds disperse the smoke after 1 minute. Strong winds disperse the smoke after 1 round.
