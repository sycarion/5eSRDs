# Glass Ring

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Ring
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Though glass is expensive and not found in all buildings, breaking a window is a common aspect of burglaryâ€”a dangerous part if there are guards to worry about. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to make the hand and arm wearing the ring pass through a single pane of glass for 2d4 + 2 rounds. Objects that you hold in that hand also pass through the glass. If your hand or arm are still through the glass at the end of the duration, you take 1d10 slashing damage as the glass breaks. 

Alternatively, when you hit a creature made of glass or crystal with a melee attack using the hand wearing the ring, you can command the ring to shatter. The hit deals an additional 2d8 damage.

The ring has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a result of 5 or less, the ring loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.
