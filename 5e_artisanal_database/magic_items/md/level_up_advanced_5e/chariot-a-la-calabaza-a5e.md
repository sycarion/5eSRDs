# Chariot a la Calabaza

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

The original chariot a la Calabaza was created by a powerful wizard with a penchant for transmutation and riding in style. It is pulled by two spectral stallions with flowing manes and tails, who function as per the __phantom steed_  spell. As an action, you may speak the command word to transform the chariot into a pumpkin two feet in diameter. Speaking the command word again transforms the pumpkin into a carriage and resummons the horses.

While in pumpkin form, the chariot is, in truth, a pumpkin, except that it does not naturally decay. Attempts to carve, smash, or draw upon the pumpkin are reflected onto the chariotâ€™s form when it reappears, although the horses seem to remain unscathed regardless of such events.
