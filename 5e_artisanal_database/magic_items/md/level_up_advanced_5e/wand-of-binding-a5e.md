While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: _hold person_ (2 charges), __hold monster_ (5 charges). Alternatively, when you attempt to escape a _grapple_  or are making a _saving throw_  to avoid being _paralyzed_  or _restrained_ , you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain _advantage_ .

This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand folds in on itself until it disappears.
