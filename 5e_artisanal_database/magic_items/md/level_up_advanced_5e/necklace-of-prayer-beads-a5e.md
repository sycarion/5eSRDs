This many-beaded necklace helps mark prayers. Of the many types of gemstone beads, 1d4+2 are magical and can be removed from the necklace as a bonus action to cast a spell (described on Table: Necklace of Prayer Beads). There are 6 types of magic beads, and which are on the necklace are randomly determined or chosen by the Narrator.

A necklace can have multiple beads of the same type. To use a bead, you must be wearing the necklace, and if it requires a spell save you use your spell save DC. Once a bead has been used, it loses its magic until the next dawn
