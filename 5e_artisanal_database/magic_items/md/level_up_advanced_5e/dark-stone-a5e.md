Five _dark stones_ are usually found together. A _dark stone_ is a black, round pebble that is cold to the touch. It can be used as sling ammunition or can be thrown up to 30 feet. If it is used as sling ammunition, a target hit by the stone takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. Whether it is fired or thrown, nonmagical fires within 10 feet of the stoneâ€™s point of impact are immediately extinguished, as are any magical lights or fires created with a spell slot of 2nd-level or lower.
