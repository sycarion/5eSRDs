While you are wearing these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your Speed and you can hover. You can use these boots to fly for 2 hours, expending at least 10 minutes worth of time with each use. If you are flying when the time runs out, you fall at a rate of 30 feet per round and take no damage from landing.

The boots regain 1 hour of flying time for every 12 hours they are not in use.
