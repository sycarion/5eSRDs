_Giant’s Bane._ When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this warhammer against a giant, the giant makes a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_  or dies. In addition, when making a weapon attack using Mjölnir against a giant, you may treat the giant as if its type were fiend or undead.

_Hurl Hammer._ The warhammer has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the warhammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the warhammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it makes a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_  or becomes _stunned_  until the end of your next turn. The warhammer regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.
