# Tyrant’s Teeth

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Dagger-sharp fangs ripped from the skull of a tyrant lizard clatter around this necklace’s cord. When you attack while wearing it, a ghostly reptilian head appears and snaps down on your target. You can only attune to this item if you have survived being bitten by a Huge or larger reptile or dragon.

While wearing this item your footsteps make the ground tremble slightly and you have _disadvantage_  on Stealth checks.

When you take energy damage, your attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type until the end of your next turn. If you are damaged by multiple energy types, you only deal bonus damage of the most recent type.

Once per day, when you hit with a melee attack you can use a bonus action to create a spectral tyrannosaur that bites the target, dealing 4d6 force damage.
