# Spell Scroll

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Scroll
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

A spell scroll bears a sealed spell within. If the spell is on your class’ spell list, you can use the scroll to cast the spell (taking the spell’s normal casting time) without the need for material components. Otherwise the _spell scroll_ is unreadable to you. If you are interrupted while using the scroll, you may attempt to use it again. Once the spell within a scroll has been cast, the scroll crumbles away. 

To use a _spell scroll_ of a higher spell level than you are able to cast, you must succeed on _spellcasting_  ability check (DC 10 + the spell’s level). On a failure, the magical energy within is expended with no effect, leaving behind a blank piece of parchment. 

A wizard may use a _spell scroll_ to copy the spell stored within to their spellbook by making an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + the spell’s level). Whether the check succeeds or not, the attempt destroys the _spell scroll_. 

The level of the spell stored within a scroll determines the _saving throw_  DC, _attack bonus_ , crafting components, cost, and rarity as per Table: Spell Scrolls. The costs of a _spell scroll_ are in addition to any material components, which are required (and if necessary also consumed) when it is made.
