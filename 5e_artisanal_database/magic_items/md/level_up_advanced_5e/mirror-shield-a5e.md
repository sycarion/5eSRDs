- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

While you are attuned to this reflective shield and have it donned, you gain resistance to radiant damage. When you are the only target of a spell being cast by a creature you can see within 60 feet, you can use your reaction to cast __counterspell_ at a level equal to your proficiency bonus (minimum 3rd-level). On a success, instead of causing the spell to fail you can redirect it back at the caster at its original spell level, using the same spell attack bonus or spell save DC. The shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn.
