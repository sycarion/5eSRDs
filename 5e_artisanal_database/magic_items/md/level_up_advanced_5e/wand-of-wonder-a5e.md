# Wand of Wonder

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and choose a creature, object, or point in space within 120 feet. Roll d100 on the Wand of Wonder table to determine the effect.

Spells cast from the wand have a spell save DC of 15 and a range of 120 feet. Area effects are centered on and include the target. If an effect might target multiple creatures, the Narrator randomly determines which ones are affected.

This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand violently shakes and sparks with magic then disappears.

| 88–90    | A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems (each worth 1 gp) shoots from the wand in a 30-foot long, 5-foot wide line. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage.

| 91–95    | A burst of shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see make a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or become _blinded_  for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 96–97    | For the next 1d10 days, the target is able to breathe underwater and its skin turns blue. If you targeted an object or point in space, the creature nearest that target is affected instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 98–100   | If you targeted a creature, it makes a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_ . If you didn’t target a creature, you become the target instead. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is instantly _petrified_ . On any other failed save, the creature is _restrained_  and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. A __greater restoration_  spell or similar magic restores a petrified creature but the effect is otherwise permanent. |
