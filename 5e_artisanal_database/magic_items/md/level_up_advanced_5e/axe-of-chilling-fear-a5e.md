# Axe of Chilling Fear

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This black iron axe is ice-cold to the touch and feels uncomfortable to hold. Its head has an iridescent blue tint to it, and frost gathers around it when it’s left to rest.

You have a +1 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  with this weapon, and when you hit a creature that’s _frightened_  of you (as per the condition) with it, it deals an extra 2d6 cold damage. Additionally, you have _advantage_  on Intimidation checks while holding it, and when you score a critical hit with it, the target must make a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_  or be frightened of you for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success.

**_Curse._** While attuned to this axe, a deep-seated fear comes to the fore. You develop a _phobia_ based on a pre-existing fear (work with the Narrator to determine something suitable), however dormant, with the following alterations: when confronted with this object of this phobia, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_ , becoming _frightened_  of it for 1 minute on a failure. On a success, you can’t be frightened by that phobia again for 1 hour. This does not affect a phobia gained in any other way.
