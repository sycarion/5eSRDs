# Staff of Power

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. When you hit with a melee attack using this staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target. Additionally, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to AC, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

**_Spells._** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: _magic missile_  (1 charge), __ray of enfeeblement_ (1 charge), __levitate_  (2 charges), __hold monster_ (5 charges), __lightning bolt_  (5th-level version, 5 charges), __wall of force_  (5 charges), __cone of cold_  (5 charges), __fireball_  (5th-level version, 5 charges), _globe of invulnerability_  (6 charges).

The staff has 20 charges and regains 2d8+4 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 20, the staff immediately regains 1d8+2 charges. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties, apart from its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

_**Retributive Strike**._ You can use an action to destroy the staff, releasing its magic in a 30-foot-radius explosion. Roll a d6\. On an even result, you teleport to a random plane of existence and avoid the explosion. On an odd result, you take damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity _saving throw_ . On a failed save, a creature takes damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as on the Retributive Strike table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

__**Table: Retributive Strike**__
| **Distance from Origin** | **Damage**               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 10 feet away or closer   | 8 × charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 feet away       | 6 × charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 feet away       | 4 x charges in the staff |
