# Dimensional Shackles

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You can use an action to shackle an _incapacitated_  Small- to Large-sized creature using these manacles. Once shackled, the creature is incapable of using or being affected by any sort of extradimensional travel or effect (including teleportation or plane shift spells and effects, but not portals). 

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. At the end of every 2 weeks that pass, a shackled creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check to break free and destroy the shackles.
