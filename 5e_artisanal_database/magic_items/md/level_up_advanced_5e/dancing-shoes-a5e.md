These shoes feature a low heel, but otherwise shape to the wearerâ€™s foot. While wearing these shoes, you gain an _expertise die_  on checks that relate to dancing.

If the shoes are separated, you may attune to one. When attuned to in this way, you know the direction of its location and if another creature has attuned to it. Once the shoes are reunited again, the effect ends.
