Engraved with symbols of healing, this warm silver pendant prevents you from dying.

* While wearing this pendant, you automatically stabilize when dying. You may still roll your Death _saving throw_  to try and roll a 20, but may only roll once on each of your turns and no more than three times.
* Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you regain twice as many as normal.
