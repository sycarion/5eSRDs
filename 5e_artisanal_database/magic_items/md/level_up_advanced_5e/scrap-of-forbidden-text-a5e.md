# Scrap of Forbidden Text

- **Rarity:** Common

- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This page of nonsense was torn from the diary of someone not well. As you focus on the strange symbols they begin to make a strange sort of sense—revealing hidden truths about the world. You can use an action to study the fragment of text to gain an expertise die on an Arcana or History check. You can’t do so again until you finish a _long rest_ .

If instead of studying the paper, you can use an action to eat it to automatically succeed on an Arcana or History check. You can wait until after making the check before deciding to eat the _scrap of forbidden text_, but you must decide before the Narrator says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

**Curse**. This scrap of text is cursed and eating it draws the attention of an aberrant creature that seeks you out to involve you in its schemes.
