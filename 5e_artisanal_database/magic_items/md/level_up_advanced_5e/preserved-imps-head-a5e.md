# Preserved Imp’s Head

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This dessicated head of a fiend mumbles occasionally as if trying to speak but cannot, its eyes and mouth sewn shut with a rough black cord. The head longs to escape this prison and return to Hell, shaking violently and cursing whenever it is within 60 feet of an active portal. 

Alternatively, as an action you can direct the head at a visible creature within 60 feet and cut the cord tying the imp’s lips, causing it to burst into flames and making the spirit inside lash out. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
