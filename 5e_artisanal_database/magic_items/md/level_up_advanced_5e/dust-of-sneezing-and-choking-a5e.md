# Dust of Sneezing and Choking

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This fine gray dust is usually found in a vial and appears to be _dust of disappearance_ , even when magic is used to _identify_ it. Each vial contains enough for a single use.

You can use an action to throw the dust into the air. You and creatures within 30 feet of you that breathe make a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or become wracked with violent coughing and sneezing, becoming _incapacitated_  and beginning to _suffocate_ . While conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on a success. A _lesser restoration_  spell also ends the effects.
