# Wind Fan

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You can use an action to wave this fan and cast _gust of wind_  (save DC 13). Each time the fan is used before the next dawn there is a cumulative 20% chance that it breaks, causing the spell to fail and for it to shred into nonmagical pieces.
