# Cravat of Strangling

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This red silk cravat appears to be—and, technically, is—extremely luxurious. While holding it, you can change its color or pattern as a bonus action. Unfortunately, it is also cursed. When you put it on, it immediately tightens. You must make a DC 14 Constitution _saving throw_  each round or begin to suffocate. On subsequent turns, you or an ally may make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to attempt to remove it. Doing so has a 50 percent chance of destroying the cravat. Attempts to cut, burn, or magically rip it off deal half damage to wearer and half to the cravat (10 hp), which only releases its hold once destroyed.
