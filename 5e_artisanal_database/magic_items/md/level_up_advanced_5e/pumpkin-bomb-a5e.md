# Pumpkin Bomb

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This pale white pumpkin is small enough to fit in the palm of a human hand. A macabre, grinning face is carved into one side, and a candle within burns an eerie purple flame. While its candle is lit, this pumpkin lantern shines _dim light_  in a 10-foot radius. The lantern’s candle burns for 1 minute, after which the pumpkin instantly rots and loses its magic.

Undead must make a DC 12 Wisdom _saving throw_  when entering the radius or when beginning their turn within the pumpkin’s light, taking 3d6 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Incorporeal undead have _disadvantage_  on this saving throw.

The pumpkin has AC 8 and 2 hit points. If the pumpkin is destroyed, all undead within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Wisdom _saving throw_ , taking 6d6 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a success.
