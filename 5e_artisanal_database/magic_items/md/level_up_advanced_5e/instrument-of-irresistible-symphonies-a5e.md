Once per week, you can use an action to speak a command word that causes this instrument to play its own beautiful music for 1 minute. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of the instrument that is able to hear the music. The creature makes a DC 13 Charisma _saving throw_  at the start of each of its turns or it is forced to dance in place for as long as the music plays. While the creature dances, it is considered _grappled_ .
