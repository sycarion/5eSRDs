Various schools of magic employ all manner of particularly foul-smelling and noxious substances, nauseating some would-be wizards to the point of illness. These enchanted amulets were created to guard against the various stenches found in their masters’ laboratories and supply closets. Enterprising apprentices quickly saw the value of peddling the enchanted trinkets to the affluent wishing to avoid the stench of the streets however, and now they are commonplace among nobility. 

The most typical of these amulets look like pomanders though dozens of different styles, varieties, and scents are available for sale. While wearing it, you can spend an action and expend 1 charge from the amulet to fill your nostrils with pleasing scents for 1 hour. These scents are chosen by the amulet’s creator at the time of its crafting. 

In more extreme circumstances like a __stinking cloud_  spell or _troglodyte’s_  stench, you can expend 3 charges as a reaction to have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against the dangerous smell until the end of your next turn. 

The amulet has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a or 5 or less, the amulet loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.
