While wearing this incredibly light chain shirt your AC equals 14 + your Dexterity modifier. If you have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can also add half your Wisdom modifier to your armor class, and wearing this armor does not interfere with the Adept Speed feature.

Once per day when you take a critical hit, you can use your reaction to make the golden chain shirt _blind_  your attacker. The creature makes a DC 16 Constitution _saving throw_  or is blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the blind creature makes another saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

In addition, your Strength increases to 17, you have _advantage_  on Strength saving throws and ability checks, and your Carrying Capacity is determined as if your size is Gargantuan (8 times as much as normal).
