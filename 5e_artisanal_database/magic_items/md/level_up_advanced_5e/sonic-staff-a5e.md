# Sonic Staff

- **Rarity:** Very Rare

- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This metal polearm has complex flanged baffles along its haft and ends with a faintly glowing two-tined cap not unlike a tuning fork. When struck it reverberates near-deafeningly and by adjusting its components you can tune it to the destructive resonance of an object.

You have a +1 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this magic weapon. It constantly emits a high-pitched whine that is uncomfortable to animals. Animals do not willingly approach within 10 feet of the staff without a successful DC 22 Animal Handling check. 

Attacks with this weapon deal double damage against doors and other objects.

Once per day, you can use an action to slam it against the ground and generate a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot radius or 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 3d6 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away. This effect cannot penetrate a _silence_ spell (or any similar magical silence effect).
