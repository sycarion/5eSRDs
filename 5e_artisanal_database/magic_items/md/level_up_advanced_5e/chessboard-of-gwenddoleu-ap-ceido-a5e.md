You can use 1d4â€“1 actions (minimum 1 action) to place each silver and crystal chess piece in its correct starting square on this gold chessboard. When you do so, the pieces emit noises and move themselves about the board in a thrilling game that lasts 1d4+1 minutes. Other creatures within 60 feet make a DC 18 Wisdom _saving throw_ . On a failed save, a creature is compelled to use its action each turn watching the chess game and it has _disadvantage_ on Wisdom (Perception) checks until the match ends or something harmful is done to it.
