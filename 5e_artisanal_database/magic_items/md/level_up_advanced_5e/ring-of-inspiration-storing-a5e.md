Sages and scholars argue about the nature of these rings, their very existence as much a mystery as the creatures that supposedly forged them. Though all of them look slightly different, at their core is a strand of destiny spun by a _fateholder_  to subtly empower and guide its pawns.

This ring stores inspiration and holds it for later use. While wearing this ring, you can choose to gain and use the inspiration stored within it. Once the inspiration is used, it is no longer stored within the ring.

When found, the ring contains 1d4 â€“ 1 inspiration, as determined by the Narrator. The ring can store up to 4 inspiration at a time. To store inspiration, a creature with inspiration spends a _short rest_  wearing the ring and chooses to bestow it. The inspiration has no immediate effect.

In addition, whenever inspiration from within the ring is used the Narrator may choose to grant a vision of possible future events of great import.
