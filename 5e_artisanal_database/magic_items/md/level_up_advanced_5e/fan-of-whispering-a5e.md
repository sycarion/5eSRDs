This fan is painted with the image of a womanâ€™s face breathing a gust of wind across a countryside. While holding this fan in front of your lips, you can communicate at a whisper to someone within 100 feet of you that you can see, without being detected by anyone else around. The fan does not grant the ability to reply to your messages.
