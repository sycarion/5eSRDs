# Sail of the Black Opal

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Rumored to be crafted from the sailcloth of the notorious Black Opal, this heavy black canvas has been roughly sewn with human hair into a cloak.

As a bonus action you can expend one charge to call on the shipâ€™s necromantic power and gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points. The sail has 3 charges and regains 1 charge for every hour spent submerged in seawater.

Additionally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points while attuned to this item, you immediately become stable as the hair burns to ash, blowing away at the faintest breeze and leaving behind a mundane piece of bone-dry sailcloth.
