You gain a +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this staff.

As an action you can command either or both ends of the staff to lengthen or shorten up to a total of 10 feet without increasing its weight. This expansion is quick but not fast enough to use as part of an attack. If the staff is longer than twice your height, weapon attacks with it have _disadvantage_ . There is no limit to the length the staff can reach. The shortest it can shrink is 5 inches, at which point it has retracted entirely into its handle and appears to be a heavy sewing needle.

You can also use an action to command the staff to increase or decrease in weight and density by up to 1 pound per round. If the staffâ€™s weight exceeds 10 lbs., any attacks made with it have _disadvantage_ , and if its weight increases to 17 lbs. or more it cannot be effectively used as a weapon. Like its length, there is no apparent limit to its maximum weight, but it cannot be reduced to less than 1 pound.

In addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this magic staff into the air and speak a command word. When you do so, the staff begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it (+10 to hit, 1d8+5 magical bludgeoning damage). While the staff hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the staff to attack one creature within 5 feet of it. After the hovering staff attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the staff has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.
