- **Rarity:** Rare

- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This corset appears to be a lightweight piece of shapewear, bound up the back with satin ribbons. In practice, it acts as a steel breastplate for the purposes of AC, donning time, and sleeping in armor; however, it imposes _disadvantage_  on Acrobatics checks instead of Stealth checks. An armored corset is considered light armor for the purposes of proficiency and imposes no maximum Dexterity modifier. Furthermore, if you wear it for longer than eight hours, you must make a DC 10 Constitution _saving throw_  or suffer a level of _fatigue_ , increasing the DC by 2 for each subsequent eight-hour stretch.
