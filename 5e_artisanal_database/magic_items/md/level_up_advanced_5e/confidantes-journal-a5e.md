Living vines hold shut this journal’s cover and part only for you. Your patron can read anything you write in the journal and can cause brief messages to appear on its pages.

If you spend a short or long rest writing your most secret thoughts in the journal, you can choose to gain Inspiration instead of regaining expended Pact Magic spell slots. The seventh time you gain Inspiration in this way, you fill the journal’s pages and can’t write in it again.
