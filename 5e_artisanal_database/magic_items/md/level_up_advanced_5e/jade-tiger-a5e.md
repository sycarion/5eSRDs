# Jade Tiger

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This jade figurine carries the memories of a _weretiger_  that spent years tracking and hunting its prey under the light of the jungle moon. When you attune to the item and keep it on your person, you gain an expertise die on Survival checks made to find and follow tracks for up to 1 hour per day.

When you speak the _jade tiger's_ command word, you vividly recall one of the _weretigerâ€™s_  most challenging hunts. For the next minute, you can use a bonus action to make a Stealth check to hide immediately before or after you take the Attack action. The _jade tiger's_ magic forever fades away after being used in this way.
