Your vision shifts into a sickly yellow tint. Your muscles tense up and contract inside you, made twitchy as new sensory information floods your brain. You gain the following benefits and powers while wearing the _goblin mask_:

**_Darkvision_.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

_**Goblin Tongue**_. You can speak, read, and write Goblin as a language.

_**Nimble Escape.**_ This mask has 5 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action during your turn. The mask regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at sunrise. If you expend the maskâ€™s last charge, roll a d20\. On a 1, the mask shrivels away and is destroyed.
