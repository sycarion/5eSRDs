# Wand of Cobwebs

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

A convincing way to cover one’s tracks is to create the appearance that an area hasn’t been disturbed in a long time. This spindly wooden wand sheds a little dust whenever you touch it. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to conjure wispy cobwebs in a 1-foot cube within 30 feet of you that you can see. The cobwebs must be anchored to two solid masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. The ground beneath the cobwebs is covered with a layer of dust that suggests at least a year of disuse. The cobwebs and dust last until cleared away.

The wand has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 charges each dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a result of 5 or less, the wand disintegrates into a mass of cobwebs.
