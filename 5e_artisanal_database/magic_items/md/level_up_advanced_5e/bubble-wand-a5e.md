# Bubble Wand

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This slender timber wand has a wooden ring at its tip. The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand bursts into a spray of colorful bubbles and is lost forever.

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend its charges and either create a harmless spray of colorful bubbles (1 charge) or cast the __dancing lights_ cantrip (2 charges). The _dancing lights_ appear as glowing bubbles.

When a creature targets you with an attack while you are holding the wand, you can use your reaction to snap it (destroying the wand). You can do this after the roll is made, but before the outcome of the attack is determined. You gain a +5 bonus to AC and a fly speed of 10 ft. as a giant soap bubble coalesces around you. The bubble persists for 1 minute or until you are hit with an attack, at which point it bursts with a loud ‘pop’.
