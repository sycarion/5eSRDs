# Ring of Shooting Stars

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Ring
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

While wearing this ring, if you are in _dim light or darkness_  you can use an action to cast _dancing lights_ or _light_. The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges at dawn.

**Faerie Fire.** You can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast _faerie fire ._

**Ball Lightning**. You can use an action and expend 2 charges to create up to four 3-foot-diameter lightning spheres. The number of spheres created determines each sphere’s intensity (see Table: Ball Lightning), each sheds light in a 30-foot radius, and they remain up to 1 minute as long as you _concentrate_  (as if concentrating on a spell). As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no further than 120 feet from you.

When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and then disappears. The creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity _saving throw_  or takes lightning damage based on the sphere’s intensity.

Shooting Stars. You can use an action to expend 1 to 3 charges. For each expended charge, you shoot a glittering mote of light at a point you can see within 60 feet where it explodes in a 15-foot-cube of sparks. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.
