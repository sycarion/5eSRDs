# Gallow Hand

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This grisly trophy is the hand of a person hung at the gallows, dipped in wax rendered from their own fat and wicked with their own hair. The fingers of this strange and complicated remnant of a malcontent can be lit just like a normal candle to shed _bright light_  in a 5-foot radius and dim light for a further 10 feet. The light shed by a _gallow hand_ is only visible to its holder and is completely _invisible_  to all other creatures.

Alternatively, all five fingers of the hand can be lit as an action. If the hand is lit in this way, it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for a further 20 feet. This light is _invisible_  to the holder but visible to all other creatures. Any creature other than the holder that enters this area of light for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Wisdom _saving throw_  or become _charmed_ . While charmed, a creatureâ€™s Speeds are reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. Once lit in this way the _gallow hand_ burns for 1 minute, after which it deteriorates into a molten nub.
