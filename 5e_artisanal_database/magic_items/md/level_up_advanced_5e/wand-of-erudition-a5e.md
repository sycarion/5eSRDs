While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one willing humanoid you can see within 30 feet. For the next hour, the target gains one of the following benefits:

* The ability to read, speak, and understand one language you are proficient with.
* Proficiency with one skill or tool with which you are proficient.
* Knowledge of some piece of information you know that you could communicate in less than 1 minute, such as the contents of a book you have read or directions to a location familiar to you. The target gains this knowledge even if you do not share a language. When the effect ends, the target forgets the information you imparted.

This wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand fades from existence and you forget you ever owned it.
