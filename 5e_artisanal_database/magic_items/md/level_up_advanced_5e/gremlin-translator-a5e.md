This Tiny ethereal orange goblinoid sits inside a decorative silver earring. The gremlin speaks Common and has limited knowledge of all other known languages, able to understand and translate the following phrases regardless of what language they are spoken in:

* Excuse me
* Please
* Yes
* No
* Where is the privy?

When prompted the gremlin provides you with the correct translation of any of those phrases in any language. It can also attempt to translate anything spoken or written in any language, however it only recognizes the words that comprise the above phrases.
