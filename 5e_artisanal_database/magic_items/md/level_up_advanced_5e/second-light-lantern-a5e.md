# Second-Light Lantern

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Many humanoid races have darkvision but some find that this curious lantern (which can be a hooded lantern or bullseye lantern) is worth carrying all the same, particularly scholars and spies who often need the finest possible detail without revealing themselves to others. When you light this lantern, you can expend 1 charge to shed second-light. Second-light is visible only to creatures with darkvision and they see the full range of colors in things illuminated by it. 

Alternatively, you can expend 1d4 charges to shed a still more specialized light, visible only to those who are touching the lanternâ€™s handle. This light lasts for a number of minutes equal to the charges expended.

The lantern has 4 charges and regains 1 charge each dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a result of 5 or less, the lantern loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.
