Once per dawn, while holding this rod you can use an action to command obedience. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet makes a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_ . On a failure, a creature is _charmed_  by you for 8 hours. A creature charmed by you regards you as its trusted leader. The charm is broken if you or your companions either command a charmed creature to do something contrary to its nature, or cause the creature harm.
