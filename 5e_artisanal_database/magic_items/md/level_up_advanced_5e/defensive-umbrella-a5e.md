# Defensive Umbrella

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This is an unassuming-looking black umbrella, but it can provide impressive protection when needed. As a bonus action when the umbrella is open, you can press a button in the handle. The canopy immediately flattens and hardens into a   _1 light shield_  and the handle transforms into a _1 rapier_ . You count as already wielding both and are considered proficient as long as you are attuned to the defensive umbrella. You can return the sword and shield to umbrella form as an action by bringing the two parts together and speaking the command word. Opening or closing the umbrella requires an action.
