# Cloak of the Shadowcaster

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Shadows writhe underneath this cloak. While attuned to and wearing this incredibly dark cloak, you have _advantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in _dim light or darkness_ . 

In addition, you can use an action to animate your _shadow_  for up to 1 hour. While animated, you can see and hear through your shadowâ€™s senses and control it telepathically. If your shadow is slain while animated, your shadow disappears until the new moon, during which time the cloak becomes nonmagical. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.
