Available from the few merchants who reside around the cityâ€™s market square, these dark, dense bread rolls are incredibly filling, but leave an unpleasant, greasy taste in your mouth

Each piece of Gloam Bread is considered one Supply. When consumed, you have _advantage_  on Wisdom _saving throws_  against the Fellspire Gloaming challenge for 24 hours.

In addition, you can make a DC 16 Wisdom _saving throw_ , reducing your _strife_  by one level on a success. Once a creature reduces its strife in this way it cannot do so again until it has had a _long rest_ .
