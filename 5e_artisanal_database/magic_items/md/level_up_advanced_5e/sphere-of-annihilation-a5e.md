# Sphere of Annihilation

- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This floating sphere of darkness is a 2-foot-diameter hole in reality that eliminates all matter that it comes into contact with. Only artifacts can survive contact with the sphere, though some artifacts have a specific weakness to its properties.

Anything that the sphere touches or that touches it that is not instantly obliterated takes 4d10 force damage. The default state of the sphere is stationary, but should a creature be in the way of a moving sphere it makes a DC 13 Dexterity _saving throw_  or takes 4d10 force damage.

While within 60 feet of an uncontrolled _sphere of annihilation_, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check and take control of it. On a success, the sphere moves in the direction of your choice a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you instead. 

If a sphere is controlled by another creature, you may wrest away control by using an action and making an Intelligence (Arcana) check opposed by the controlling creature. On a success, you take control of the sphere and can utilize it as normal. 

A unique effect happens when a sphere comes into contact with a planar portal or extradimensional space (such as a _portable hole_ ). In the case of such an event, the Narrator rolls d100 to determine what happens next: on 1–50 the sphere is destroyed, on 51–85 the sphere simply moves through the portal or into the space, and on 86–100 a rift forms that pulls in all creatures and objects within 180 feet. Each object and creature, including the sphere, reappears in a random plane of existence.
