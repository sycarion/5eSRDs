# Fizzy Lifter

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Potion
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This glass bottle contains a brown bubbly liquid and bears a winking wizard on the label. When you are _unconscious_  and have at least 1 hit point, if another creature forces you to sniff this powerful concoction you immediately wake up. 

Alternatively, when you consume this potion you are targeted by the __levitate_  spell (save DC 14) but are also comically bloated with bubbles, taking a −2 penalty to Constitution _saving throws_  for the duration.

__Fizzy Lifter_ and __Fizzy Rocks_ 

Ideally the combination of these two confections should be left ambiguous but indescribably bad. It should be a “relative of a friend of a friend died from it” sort of legend and the Narrator should create any mad reactions that they feel are interesting. However, if an adventurer ignores the warning and consumes both items at once this optional effect may be used:

When a creature consumes both _fizzy lifter_ and _fizzy rocks_ within a minute of each other, the arcane chemical reaction causes the effects of both items to end and a torrent of harmless foam to rocket out of the creature’s mouth, propelling it in the opposite direction. Determine a direction randomly by rolling a d8\. The creature is pushed 100 feet in that direction. This movement does not provoke _opportunity attacks_ . If it impacts a creature or object along this path it stops, is knocked _prone_ , and takes 23 (5d8) bludgeoning damage, dealing the same amount of damage to whatever it impacts.
