The days of wondering what the socialites across the room are chatting about have come to an end! This brass earring is sculpted into the shape of whispering maidens. Whenever a creature says your name while within 100 feet the earring activates, transmitting the creatureâ€™s words as a hushed whisper into your ears until it has gone at least 1 minute without saying your name.
