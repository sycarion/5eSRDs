While wearing this ring, you have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against spells that target only you (not an area of effect spell). Additionally, on a saving throw with a natural 20 if the spell is 7th-level or lower, the spell instead targets the caster, using their original slot level, spell save DC, spell attack modifier, and spellcasting ability.
