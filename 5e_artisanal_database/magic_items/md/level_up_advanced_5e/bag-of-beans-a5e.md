# Bag of Beans

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans and weighs ½ pound plus ¼ pound for each bean inside.

Dumping the bag’s contents on the ground creates a fiery 10-foot radius explosion. The fire ignites unattended flammable objects. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 5d4 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. 

You may also take a bean from the bag and plant it in dirt or sand and water it, producing an effect 1 minute later centered on where it was planted.

To determine the effect the Narrator may create something entirely new, choose one from the following table, or roll.

Table: Bag of Beans

| 1     | 5d4 toadstools with strange markings appear. When a creature eats a toadstool (raw or cooked), roll any die. An even result grants 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour, and an odd result requires the creature to make a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or take 5d6 poison damage and become _poisoned_  for 1 hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 2–10  | 1d4+1 geysers erupt. Each one spews a different liquid (chosen by the Narrator) 30 feet into the air for 1d6 rounds: beer, berry juice, cooking oil, tea, vinegar, water, or wine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11–20 | A fully developed _treant_  appears. There is a 50% chance it is chaotic evil, in which case it immediately attacks the nearest creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 21–30 | A stone statue in your likeness with an angry countenance rises. The statue is immobile except for its mouth, which can move and speak. It constantly rails threats and insults against you. If you leave the statue, it knows where you are (if you are on the same plane of existence) and tells anyone who comes near that you are the worst of villains, urging them to kill you. The statue attempts to cast _geas_ (save DC 10) on any nearby creature that can speak a language you do (and isn’t your friend or companion) with the command to find and kill you. After 24 hours, the statue loses the ability to speak and cast geas, becoming completely inanimate.                                                                                    |
| 31–40 | A campfire with green flames appears for 24 hours or until it is extinguished. The area in a 10-foot radius is a haven.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 41–50 | 1d6+6 fully developed _shriekers_  appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 51–60 | 1d4+8 small pods sprout, which then unfurl to allow a luminescent pink toad to crawl out of each one. A toad transforms into a Large or smaller beast (determined by the Narrator) whenever touched. The beast remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of luminescent pink smoke.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 61–70 | A fully developed _shambling mound_  appears. It is not hostile but appears perplexed as it is _stunned_  for 1d4 rounds. Once the stun effect ends, it is _frightened_  for 1d10+1 rounds. The source of its fear is one randomly determined creature it can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 71–80 | A tree with tantalizing fruit appears, but then turns into glass that refracts light in a dazzlingly beautiful manner. The glass tree evaporates over the next 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 81–90 | A nest appears containing 1d4+3 vibrantly multicolored eggs with equally multicolored yolks. Any creature that eats an egg (raw or cooked) makes a DC 20 Constitution _saving throw_ . On a success, the creature's lowest ability score permanently increases by 1 (randomly choosing among equally low scores). On a failure, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 91–99 | A 5-foot hole with swirling multicolored vapors inside appears. All creatures within 10 feet of the hole that have an Intelligence of 6 or higher hear urgent, loving whispers from within in a language they understand. Each creature makes a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_  or try to leap into the hole. The first creature to jump into the hole (or more than one, if multiple creatures jump in simultaneously) disappears for 1 day before reappearing. A creature has no memory of the previous 24 hours when it reappears, but finds a new randomly determined magic item of uncommon rarity among its possessions. It also gains the benefits of a _long rest_ . The hole disappears after 1 minute, or as soon as a creature jumps completely into it. |
| 100   | A fantastic, gargantuan beanstalk erupts and grows to a height determined by the Narrator. The Narrator also chooses where the top leads. These options (and more) are possible: the castle of a giant, a magnificent view, a different plane of existence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
