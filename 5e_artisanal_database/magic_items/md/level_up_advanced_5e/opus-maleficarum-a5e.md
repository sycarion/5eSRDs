This book looks to have survived a fire. Its pages are browned upon the edges with many corners lost to char. The cover appears to be made from the skin of a reptile, but the blackened scales are cracked from the flames making identification all but impossible. Within, the pages of this book are filled with profane writings, eldritch symbols, and twisted imagery one might associate with a warlock’s book of shadows. Largely illegible, to those of a more martial bent the meanings of strange words become clear.

Spending at least 24 hours over the course of 7 nights reading and practicing the forms and phrases within the _Opus_ allows a reader with access to martial maneuvers to learn a single maneuver from the Eldritch Blackguard combat tradition, as long as it is of a degree they can learn. This does not count against the character’s limit of known combat traditions or maneuvers. Any character capable of casting a cantrip or 1st level spell who reads the _Opus_ also suffers 1 level of _strife_ .

Once this tome has been read, it becomes a mundane item for one year and a day before it regains its magic
