# Dust of Disappearance

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This shimmering dust is usually found in a small vial that contains enough for a single use. You can use an action to scatter the dust into the air, covering you and each creature and object within 10 feet and rendering them _invisible_  for 2d4 minutes. This consumes the dust. If an affected creature casts a spell or attacks, the effect ends for that creature.
