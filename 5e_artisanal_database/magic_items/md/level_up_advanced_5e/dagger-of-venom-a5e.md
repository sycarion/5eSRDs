You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic blade. In addition, once each dawn you can use an action to poison the dagger’s blade for 1 minute or until it is used to damage a creature. When a creature is damaged by the blade’s poison, it makes a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or takes 2d10 poison damage and becomes _poisoned_  for 1 minute.
