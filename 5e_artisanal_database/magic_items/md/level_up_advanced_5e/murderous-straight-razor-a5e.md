# Murderous Straight Razor

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This otherwise gleaming implement has dark stains that cannot be polished or scrubbed off. You gain a +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this razor. A number of times per day equal to half your proficiency bonus, when you hit with a melee attack you can use a bonus action to channel the inherent hatred of the razor, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage.

_**Curse.**_ Once attuned to this weapon, you are _cursed_  until you are targeted by _remove curse_ or similar magic. Your appearance and manner have a hint of murderous rage at all times, giving you _disadvantage_  on Charisma checks and making beasts hostile towards you. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with any other weapon and must make a DC 14 Wisdom _saving throw_  to willingly part with the razor, even temporarily.
