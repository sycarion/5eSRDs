# Cubic Gate

- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This 3-inch cube has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. Each side of the cube is keyed to a different plane, one of which is the Material Plane. The other five sides are determined by the Narrator.

As an action, you may press one side of the cube and spend a charge to cast the _gate  s_pell, expending a charge and opening a portal to the associated plane. You may instead press a side twice, expending 2 charges and casting _plane shift_ (save DC 17) which sends the targets to the associated plane.
