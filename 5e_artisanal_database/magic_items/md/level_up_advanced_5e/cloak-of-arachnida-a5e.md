While wearing this cloak, you gain the following benefits:

* Resistance to poison damage.
* A climbing speed equal to your base Speed, allowing hands-free movement across vertical and upside down surfaces.
* The ability to ignore the effects of webs and move through them as if they were _difficult terrain_ .

Once between long rests you can use an action to cast the __web_  spell (save DC 13), except it fills double the normal area.
