# Horn of Valhalla

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You can use an action to blow this horn and summon the spirits of fallen warriors. These spirits appear within 60 feet of you and use the statistics for _berserker hordes_ . They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again for 7 days.

Four types of _horn of Valhalla_ are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many _berserker hordes_  answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The Narrator chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.
