# Shackle of the Ghostheart Covenant

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This shackle has an etched knot pattern running around it, which is flecked with white ashes. It’s finely-polished, weightless, and slightly translucent. While a _shackle of the ghostheart covenant_ can be purposefully made, these objects often appear through the sheer force of will of a given ghost.

While attuned to this shackle, you can see and physically interact with incorporeal undead within 30 feet, and your weapon attacks and unarmed strikes bypass their _damage resistance_  to nonmagical weapons. Additionally, you can’t be possessed and gain _expertise_  on _saving throws_  caused by undead.

_**Curse.**_ The spirit bound to this shackle still lingers within it. They don’t speak directly, but may communicate through cryptic visions and dreams or even exhibit poltergeist-like activity at inopportune times if you ignore their wishes. The only way to end your attunement to this item is to cut off the limb it’s attached to, which the spirit takes it as tribute. The limb can never be regrown, even through magic.

**_Escalation._** The spirit bound to this shackle has motives and desires left unfulfilled from its death. Each time you meaningfully advance these motives, choose one of the following benefits.

_Echo Strike._ When you make a weapon attack against a creature or cast a cantrip with a creature as the target, you can use your bonus action to cause a translucent echo of your form to repeat the attack or cantrip against the same creature. Once you have used this property, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.

_Foot in the Grave._ While _bloodied_ , you gain _resistance_  to necrotic damage and non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

_Ghostwalk._ At the start of your turn, you can activate the shackle as a bonus action to become incorporeal until the end of your turn. While incorporeal, you can only take the Dash action, but you gain _immunity_  to all damage, and can move through solid objects and creatures. If you end your turn inside a solid object or another creature, you’re shunted into the nearest free space and take 1d6 force damage for every 5 feet you were moved in the process. Once you have used this property, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.
