# Cane of Chaos

- **Rarity:** Artifact

The _Cane of Chaos_ (known by some by its fairytale name, the Little Silver Stick) is a gorgeous silver scepter etched with fractals, adorned with an eight-pointed star, and imbued with the power of chaos. A cunning historian may be able to track the cane’s origins to a certain mage under a certain authoritarian regime centuries ago, who supplied it to a figure widely known for their role in the regime’s downfall. Similarly, the cane seems to be drawn to those who march to their own drumbeat, directing them on behalf of its creator to sow disruption and turmoil.

**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the _Cane of Chaos_, used by a despot in times long past. It is also known as the Little Silver Stick.

**DC 18** The cane stores and is able to cast spells linked to chaos, but randomly unleashes chaotic magical effects when used.

**DC 21** The cane can only be destroyed by a sovereign on the day of their coronation.

**Artifact Properties**

The _Cane of Chaos_ has 1d4 lesser artifact benefits, 1d4 lesser artifact detriments, 1d4–1 greater artifact benefits, and 1d4+1 greater artifact detriments. 

In addition, the cane has the finesse property and can be used as a double weapon which you become proficient with when you attune to it. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls and damage rolls made using the _Cane of Chaos_.

## **Magic**

While you use this quarterstaff as a spell focus, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC. You know and have prepared all spells of the chaos school of magic (but not their rare versions). 

The _Cane of Chaos_ begins with a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus and regains 1d6 charges each dawn (to a maximum number of charges equal to your level + 1, or your CR + 1). You can expend any number of charges from the cane to cast a chaos spell, which costs a number of charges equal to the spell’s level. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).

When you expend charges from the _Cane of Chaos_, it unleashes another chaotic magical effect, either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined.

| 1      | One random creature you see is subject to a _polymorph_  spell cast by the cane (using your spell save DC), turning it into a random CR 1/8 beast.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2      | The 1d6 doors nearest to you come under an _arcane lock_  effect as though cast by the creature nearest to you that can speak, write, or sign at least one language.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 3      | The cane creates a __control weather_  effect, driving the weather towards unseasonable extreme temperatures and conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4      | Each creature within 60 feet rolls 1d6, increasing a random ability score to 18 for the next 10 minutes (1: Strength, 2: Dexterity, 3: Constitution, 4: Intelligence, 5: Wisdom, 6: Charisma).                                                                                                                                                  |
| 5      | Each creature within 60 feet is subject to a __levitation_ effect created by the cane (using your spell save DC). Each creature has _disadvantage_  on _saving throws_  against the effect and on a failure immediately rises 60 feet. For the duration, each creature can control its own movement as though it had cast _levitate_ on itself. |
| 6      | You grow 1d6 inches taller (this effect cannot increase your size category).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 7      | If you are a humanoid you are permanently transformed into a different humanoid heritage (as per Table: Reincarnation for the _reincarnate_  spell).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 8      | Duplicates of yourself appear within 60 feet! Roll 1d6 to determine their nature (1–2: 1d6 _animated armors_ , 3–4: a _mirror image_  effect, 5–6: a __simulacrum_  effect).                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Destroying the Cane

The _Cane of Chaos_ is born from the very essence of rebellion. To destroy it, you must offer the artifact as a gift to a sovereign on the day of their coronation or to a magical being with the Lawful alignment trait on the anniversary of their advent. If accepted as such a gift, the _Cane of Chaos_ melts into a puddle of ordinary molten silver.
