Inside of this iron locket waits a Tiny ethereal green goblinoid endlessly counting to itself. The magical creature obeys very limited instructions but only when they relate to timekeeping. It counts the seconds, minutes, and hours accurately out loud as they pass, immediately losing count when interrupted.
