# Pipes of Haunting

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Using these pipes requires proficiency with wind instruments. You can use an action and expend 1 charge to play them and create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet that hears you play makes a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_  or becomes _frightened_  of you for 1 minute. You may choose for nonhostile creatures in the area to automatically succeed on the saving throw. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to these _pipes of haunting_ for 24 hours. The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 charges each dawn.
