When unfolded, this handkerchief-sized piece of lightweight, silky fabric expands into a 6-foot diameter circular sheet.

You can use an action to unfold the cloth and spread it on a solid surface, creating a two-way portal to another plane of existence chosen by the Narrator. You can use an action to close the portal by folding the cloth. Once a portal has been opened in this manner, it cannot be opened again for 1d8 hours.
