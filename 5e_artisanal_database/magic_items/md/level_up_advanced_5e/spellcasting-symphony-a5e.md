A noted bard created these flawless instruments to be exemplary examples of their kind. In addition to creating music of rare quality, they are able to cast spells as they are played as well as offering additional unique benefits.

While attuned to one of these instruments, you gain an additional benefit and can use an action to cast one of the spells an instrument knows by playing it. Once you have done so, the instrument can not be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

If you are not a bard, when attempting to play one of these instruments you make a DC 14 Charisma _saving throw_  or take 3d6 psychic damage.

When using one of these instruments to make a Performance check you gain an expertise die (1d8).
