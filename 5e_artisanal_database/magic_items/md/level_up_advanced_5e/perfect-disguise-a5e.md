# Perfect Disguise

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This set of novelty glasses has a comically-oversized false nose along with a thick fake mustache and bushy eyebrows. These glasses have 3 charges and regain 1 charge each dawn. While wearing the glasses you can expend 1 charge to cast the spell __disguise self_  (save DC 14). 

However, you cannot mask the glasses themselves using __disguise self_  in this wayâ€”no matter how your disguise looks, it includes the novelty glasses.

If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a result of 5 or less, the _perfect disguise_ is glued to your face (as _sovereign glue_ ) and it becomes a mundane item.
