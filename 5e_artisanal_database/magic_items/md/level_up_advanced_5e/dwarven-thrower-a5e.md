You gain +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic warhammer. In addition, while you are attuned to the hammer, you may throw it with a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet. On a hit with a ranged attack using this hammer it deals an extra 1d8 damage (2d8 damage if the target is a giant). When thrown the warhammer immediately flies back to your hand after it hits or misses its target.
