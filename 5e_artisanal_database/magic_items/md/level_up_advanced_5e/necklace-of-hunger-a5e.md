# Necklace of Hunger

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

While you are attuned to and wearing this necklace of serrated teeth, you gain a bite natural weapon attack that deals 1d6 magical piercing damage, and you cannot become _diseased_  or _poisoned_  from anything you eat or drink.

In addition, you may eat anything organic that can reasonably fit in your mouth without difficulty (or regard for taste) and gain sustenance from doing so as if you have consumed a normal meal. 

**Curse.** Your appearance and aura carries a hint of malice and despair. You have _disadvantage_  on Charisma checks and beasts are hostile towards you.
