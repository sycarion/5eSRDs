# Staff of the Magi

- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You have a +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this magic quarterstaff. Additionally, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to _spell attack rolls_  and _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against spells.

_**Spell Absorption.**_ When another creature casts a spell which targets only you, you can use your reaction to cause the staff to absorb the magic of the spell, cancelling its effect and gaining charges equal to the spell’s level. If this brings the staff’s total charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its Retributive Strike.

_**Spells.**_ While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: __flaming sphere_ (2 charges), _invisibility_ (2 charges), _knock_  (2 charges), _web_ (2 charges), __dispel magic_  (3 charges), _ice storm_  (4 charges), _wall of fire_ (4 charges), __passwall_  (5 charges), __telekinesis_ (5 charges), __conjure elemental_  (7 charges), _fireball_  (7th-level version, 7 charges), _lightning bolt_  (7th-level version, 7 charges), __plane shift_  (7 charges).  
You can also use an action to cast the following spells from the staff without expending any charges: __arcane lock , detect magic , enlarge/reduce , light , mage hand , protection from evil and good ._

The staff has 50 charges and regains 4d6+2 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 20, the staff immediately regains 1d12+1 charges.

_**Retributive Strike.**_ You can use an action to destroy the staff, releasing its magic in a 30-foot-radius explosion. Roll a d6\. On an even result, you teleport to a random plane of existence and avoid the explosion. On an odd result, you take damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity _saving throw_ . On a failed save, a creature takes damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as on the _Retributive Strike_  table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
