# Waystone

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This rounded oval stone has a metallic gray luster. When one or more _waystones_ are kept in contact for an hour or longer, they become paired and magnetically attracted to each other for 1 week per hour spent in contact. Paired _waystones_ are ideal for use as trail markers, for tracking purposes, or to prevent yourself from becoming lost. You can use an action to speak its command word, making the _waystone_ sense and be drawn toward the nearest _waystone_ within 5 miles, or if it is paired to another _waystone_ within range, the paired _waystone_. Paired waystones are only able to sense each other.

A _waystone_ has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You may expend 1 charge when speaking its command word to increase the _waystone’s_ range to 25 miles, or if the _waystone_ is paired, to sense the nearest unpaired _waystone_ within 5 miles. When used in either manner, the _waystone’s_ attraction lasts until the next dawn. If you expend the last charge, the _waystone_ becomes a mundane item.
