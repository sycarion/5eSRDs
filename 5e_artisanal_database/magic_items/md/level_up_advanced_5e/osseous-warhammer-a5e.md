Attacks made using this grim-looking weapon do both physical and supernatural harm. You can use a bonus action to let the weapon feed off your life force. While activated, whenever you successfully hit with the warhammer you deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage, but also take 1d4 cold damage. This effect lasts until deactivated by using another bonus action or letting go of the weapon.
