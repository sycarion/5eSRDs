For the debonair gentleman or sophisticated lady who wishes to attend the ball in something respectable but still retain the safety of mind that armor provides, this set of padded leather armor is glamored with an illusion that makes it look like a finely-tailored suit or dress. This illusion does not hold up to physical scrutiny and any creature who physically interacts with the armor sees through the figment with a successful DC 10 Investigation check.
