# Cord of Spirit Stealing

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This leather cord is the color of stained blood and feels slightly moist. When wrapped around the handle of a melee weapon, the cord captures some of the energy of any sapient creature the weapon is used to kill. When you reduce a hostile sapient creature to 0 hit points, the cord gains 1 charge (to a maximum of 5). You can use a bonus action to spend 1 charge from the cord to cast _false life_ , or expend more additional charges to increase the spellâ€™s level to the number of charges expended.
