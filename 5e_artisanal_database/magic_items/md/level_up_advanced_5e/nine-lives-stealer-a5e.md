You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword.

The sword has 1d8+1 charges. When you use the sword to score a critical hit against a creature that is not a construct or undead, if it has less than 100 hit points it makes a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or it instantly dies as the sword rips the life force out of it. Each time a creature is killed in this manner the sword expends a charge. When all its charges are gone, the sword loses this property.
