This crystal phial appears empty unless it is agitated, which reveals that it is filled to the brim with a clear liqueur. Close examination reveals bubbles within the liquid that seem to be shaped like tiny skulls. Pouring the phialâ€™s contents into the mouth of a dead creature animates it as if it were the target of a __speak with dead_ spell.
