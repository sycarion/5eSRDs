This pad of light tissue paper contains 4d6 sheets and is enchanted with a subtle magic. When a sheet of paper is pressed to a written page, such as a book or letter, and left there for six seconds, it transfers a perfect copy of the text onto the thin paper. The copy would never pass for the original, but preserves details such as handwriting.
