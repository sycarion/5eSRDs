When exposed to freezing temperatures the blade of this magic sword sheds _bright light_  in a 10-foot radius and _dim light_  for an additional 10 feet. While you are attuned to the sword, attacks using it deal an extra 1d6 cold damage and you gain resistance to fire damage. Once per hour, when you draw the sword you can choose to extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet.
