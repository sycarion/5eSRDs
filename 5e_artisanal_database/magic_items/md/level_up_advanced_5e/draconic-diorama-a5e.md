# Draconic Diorama

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This Tiny diorama is contained within a cube-shaped box 5 inches on each side. The bottom is lead and the rest made of transparent crystal. Inside the box there are several trees made of paper and wire, a treasure chest made of clay, and a 1Â½-inch dragon skeleton. The skeleton stands in a different position each time the box is examined but it does not move while being observed.

While you carry the diorama, you have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against Frightful Presence.

A successful DC 13 Arcana or Nature check reveals the skeleton is an actual dragon skeleton that has been shrunk to fit inside the box. 

**Curse.** While carrying the cursed diorama you are compelled to amass more wealth. As long as you are compelled, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma _saving throw_  to willingly part with the diorama, even temporarily.
