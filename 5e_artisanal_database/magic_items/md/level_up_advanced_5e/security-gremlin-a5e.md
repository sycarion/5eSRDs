This military-styled tin contains a Tiny ethereal mottled green goblinoid dressed in soldierâ€™s armor and when opened it salutes with earnest eagerness. You can instruct this gremlin to patrol an area, such as the perimeter of a room, campsite, or structure, while keeping watch for a creature type you instruct it to watch for. It completely ignores any creatures that are not of the chosen creature type. If it spots a creature of the chosen type, it immediately begins shouting loud enough to be heard within 30 feet as it runs back into its tin to hide.
