While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast fireball (save DC 15). For 1 charge, you cast the spellâ€™s 3rd-level version. Increase the spell slot level by one for each additional expended charge.

This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand disappears in a flash of fire and smoke.
