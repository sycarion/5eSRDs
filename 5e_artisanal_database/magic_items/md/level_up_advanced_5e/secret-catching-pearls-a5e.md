# Secret-catching Pearls

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This necklace is a work of art; a delicate golden chain with a shower of 2d6+2 pearls affixed to it. As a bonus action, you can detach a pearl. On your subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to listen through the pearl, allowing you to hear as though you were there. This effect ends after ten minutes or if the wearer removes the necklace.

Once all pearls have been removed, the necklace becomes a mundane gold chain worth 30 gp.
