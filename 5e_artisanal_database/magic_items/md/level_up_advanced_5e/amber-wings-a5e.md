This pair of amber dragonfly wings holds the memories of a native of the Dreaming who befriended several insect companions. You can speak with insects when carrying the wings in your hand or wearing them as a piece of jewelry. When you speak the name of the fey creature whose memories lie within the wings, you briefly experience the sensation of flying atop a giant dragonfly. For 1 minute after speaking the name, you can glide up to 60 feet per round. This functions as though you have a fly speed of 60 feet, but you can only travel horizontally or on a downward slant. The wings crumble to dust after the gliding effect ends.
