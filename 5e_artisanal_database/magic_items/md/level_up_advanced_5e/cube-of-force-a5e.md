# Cube of Force

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This inch-long cube has a recessed button with a distinct marking on each face. It starts with 36 charges and regains 1d20 of them at dawn. 

You can use an action to press one of the buttons, expending charges as shown on the Cube of Force table. If the cube has insufficient charges, nothing happens.

Otherwise, the cube creates a 15-foot cube of force that is centered on you and moves with you. It lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press another button, or the cube’s charges are depleted. 

You can change the cube’s effect by pressing a different button. Doing so expends the requisite number of charges and resets the duration.

If moving causes the cube to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you cannot move any closer to that object while the cube is active.

The cube loses charges when targeted by effects from the following spells or magic items: _disintegrate_ (1d12 charges), __horn of blasting_ (1d10 charges), __passwall_  (1d6 charges), __prismatic spray_  (1d20 charges), __wall of fire_  (1d4 charges).
