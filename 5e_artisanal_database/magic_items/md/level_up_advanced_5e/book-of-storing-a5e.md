# Book of Storing

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

After you attune to this 1-foot square 6-inch thick book it hides its true nature to anybody else, appearing to be a mundane diary. When you open it however, the book reveals a Tiny storage compartment.

The storage space is the same size as the book, and because this item doesnâ€™t function as a pocket dimension it can be safely used to store such items (such as a __portable hole_ ).
