This cerulean blue liquid sits calmly in its flask even when jostled or shaken. When you drink this potion, you have advantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws for 1 hour. For the duration, if you fail a saving throw against an enchantment or illusion spell or similar magic effect, you can choose to succeed instead. If you do, you draw upon all the potion's remaining power, and its effects end immediately thereafter.
