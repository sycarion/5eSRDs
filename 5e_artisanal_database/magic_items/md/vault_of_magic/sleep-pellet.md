- **Rarity:** Uncommon

- **Attunement:** No

This small brass pellet measures 1/2 of an inch in diameter. Typically, 1d6 + 4 sleep pellets are found together. You can use the pellet as a sling bullet and shoot it at a creature using a sling. On a hit, the pellet is destroyed, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can use an action to swallow the pellet harmlessly. Once before 1 minute has passed, you can use an action to exhale a cloud of sleeping gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to wake it.
