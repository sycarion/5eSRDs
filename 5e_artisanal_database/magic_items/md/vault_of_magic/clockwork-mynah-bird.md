- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This mechanical brass bird is nine inches long from the tip of its beak to the end of its tail, and it can become active for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. If you use your action to speak the first command word (“listen” in Ignan), it cocks its head and listens intently to all nearby sounds with a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 17 for up to 10 minutes. When you give the second command word (“speak”), it repeats back what it heard in a metallic-sounding—though reasonably accurate—portrayal of the sounds. You can use the clockwork mynah bird to relay sounds and conversations it has heard to others. As an action, you can command the mynah to fly to a location it has previously visited within 1 mile. It waits at the location for up to 1 hour for someone to command it to speak. At the end of the hour or after it speaks its recording, it returns to you. The clockwork mynah bird has an Armor Class of 14, 5 hit points, and a flying speed of 50 feet.
