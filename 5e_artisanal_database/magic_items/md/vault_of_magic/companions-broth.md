Developed by wizards with an interest in the culinary arts, this simple broth mends the wounds of companion animals and familiars. When a beast or familiar consumes this broth, it regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Alternatively, you can mix a flower petal into the broth, and the beast or familiar gains 2d4 temporary hit points for 8 hours instead.
