This black ivory, rune-carved wand has 7 charges. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the guiding bolt spell from it, using an attack bonus of +7. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
