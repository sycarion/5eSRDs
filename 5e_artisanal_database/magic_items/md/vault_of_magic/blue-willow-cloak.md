This light cloak of fey silk is waterproof. While wearing this cloak in the rain, you can use your action to pull up the hood and become invisible for up to 1 hour. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell, if you use an action to pull down the hood, or if the rain stops. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
