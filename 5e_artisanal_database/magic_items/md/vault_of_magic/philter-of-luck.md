When you drink this vibrant green, effervescent potion, you gain a finite amount of good fortune. Roll a d3 to determine where your fortune falls: ability checks (1), saving throws (2), or attack rolls (3). When you make a roll associated with your fortune, you can choose to tap into your good fortune and reroll the d20. This effect ends after you tap into your good fortune or when 1 hour has passed. | d3 | Use fortune for |

| 1 | ability checks |
| 2 | saving throws |
