# Clacking Teeth

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Taken from a Fleshspurned (see Tome of Beasts 2), a toothy ghost, this bony jaw holds oversized teeth that sweat ectoplasm. The jaw has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the jaw, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 30 feet of you. The jaw's teeth clatter together, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be confused for 1 minute. While confused, the target acts as if under the effects of the confusion spell. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
