# Ensnaring Ammunition

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this magical ammunition, the target takes only half the damage from the attack, and the target is restrained as the ammunition bursts into entangling strands that wrap around it. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the bonds on a success. The strands can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
