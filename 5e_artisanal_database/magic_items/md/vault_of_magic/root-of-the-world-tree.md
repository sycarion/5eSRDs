# Root of the World Tree

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Rod
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Crafted from the root burl of a sacred tree, this rod is 2 feet long with a spiked, knobby end. Runes inlaid with gold decorate the full length of the rod. This rod functions as a magic mace. Blood Anointment. You can perform a 1-minute ritual to anoint the rod in your blood. If you do, your hit point maximum is reduced by 2d4 until you finish a long rest. While your hit point maximum is reduced in this way, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and, when you hit a fey or giant with this weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. Holy Anointment. If you spend 1 minute anointing the rod with a flask of holy water, you can cast the augury spell from it. The runes carved into the rod glow and move, forming an answer to your query.
