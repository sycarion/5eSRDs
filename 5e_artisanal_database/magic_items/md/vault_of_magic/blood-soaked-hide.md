# Blood-Soaked Hide

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

A creature that starts its turn in your space must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose 3d6 hit points due to blood loss, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the number of hit points the creature lost. Constructs and undead who aren't vampires are immune to this effect. Once used, you can't use this property of the armor again until the next dawn.
