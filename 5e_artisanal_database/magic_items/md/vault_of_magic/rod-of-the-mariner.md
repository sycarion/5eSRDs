# Rod of the Mariner

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Rod
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This thin bone rod is topped with the carved figurine of an albatross in flight. The rod has 5 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges and point the rod at one or more creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, expending 1 charge for each creature. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for 1 minute. A cursed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws while within 100 feet of a body of water that is at least 20 feet deep. The rod regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod crumbles to dust and is destroyed, and you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for 1 minute as if you had been the target of the rod's power.
