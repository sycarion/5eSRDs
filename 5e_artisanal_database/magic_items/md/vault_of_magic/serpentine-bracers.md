# Serpentine Bracers

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

These bracers are a pair of golden snakes with ruby eyes, which coil around your wrist and forearm. While wearing both bracers, you gain a +1 bonus to AC if you are wearing no armor and using no shield. You can use an action to speak the bracers' command word and drop them on the ground in two unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of you. The bracers become two constrictor snakes under your control and act on their own initiative counts. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return a bracer to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake. On your turn, you can mentally command each snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the snakes take and where they move during their next turns, or you can issue them a general command, such as attack your enemies or guard a location. If a snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies, reverts to its bracer form, and can't be commanded to become a snake again until 2 days have passed. If a snake reverts to bracer form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them and can't be commanded to become a snake again until the next dawn.
