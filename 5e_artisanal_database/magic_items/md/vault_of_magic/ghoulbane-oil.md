This rusty-red gelatinous liquid glistens with tiny sparkling crystal flecks. The oil can coat one weapon or 5 pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, if a ghoul, ghast, or Darakhul (see Tome of Beasts) takes damage from the coated item, it takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type.
