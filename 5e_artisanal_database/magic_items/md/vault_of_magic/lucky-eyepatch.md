You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear this simple, black eyepatch. In addition, if you are missing the eye that the eyepatch covers and you roll a 1 on the d20 for a saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The eyepatch can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
