# Armor of the Ngobou

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This thick and rough armor is made from the hide of a Ngobou (see Tome of Beasts), an aggressive, ox-sized dinosaur known to threaten elephants of the plains. The horns and tusks of the dinosaur are worked into the armor as spiked shoulder pads. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have a magical sense for elephants. You automatically detect if an elephant has passed within 90 feet of your location within the last 24 hours, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks you make to find elephants.
