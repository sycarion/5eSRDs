These leather and fur wraps are imbued with centaur shamanic magic. The wraps are stained a deep amber color, and intricate motifs painted in blue seem to float above the surface of the leather. While wearing these wraps, you can call on their magic to reroll an attack made with a shortbow or longbow. You must use the new roll. Once used, the wraps must be held in wood smoke for 15 minutes before they can be used in this way again.
