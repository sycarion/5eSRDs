# Grasping Cloak

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Made of strips of black leather, this cloak always shines as if freshly oiled. The strips writhe and grasp at nearby creatures. While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to grapple a creature no more than one size larger than you within 5 feet of you. The strips make the grapple attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target is grappled by the cloak, leaving your hands free to perform other tasks or actions that require both hands. However, you are still considered to be grappling a creature, limiting your movement as normal. The cloak can grapple only one creature at a time. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to command the strips to aid you in grappling. If you do so, you have advantage on your next attack roll made to grapple a creature. While grappling a creature in this way, you have advantage on the contested check if a creature attempts to escape your grapple.
