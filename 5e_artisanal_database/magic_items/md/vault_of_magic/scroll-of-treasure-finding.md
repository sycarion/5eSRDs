Each scroll of treasure finding works for a specific type of treasure. You can use an action to read the scroll and sense whether that type of treasure is present within 1 mile of you for 1 hour. This scroll reveals the treasure's general direction, but not its specific location or amount. The GM chooses the type of treasure or determines it by rolling a d100 and consulting the following table. | dice: 1d% | Treasure Type |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 01-10 | Copper |
| 11-20 | Silver |
| 21-30 | Electrum |
| 31-40 | Gold |
| 41-50 | Platinum |
| 51-75 | Gemstone |
| 76-80 | Art objects |
| 81-00 | Magic items |
