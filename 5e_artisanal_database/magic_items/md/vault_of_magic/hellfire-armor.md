This spiked armor is a dark, almost black crimson when inactive. While wearing this armor, you can use an action to cause it to glow and appear red-hot, giving you a hellish appearance. The armor sheds light as a candle, but it doesnâ€™t emit heat. The effect lasts until you use a bonus action to end it.
