This blackened iron shield is adorned with the menacing relief of a monstrously gaunt skull. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. While holding this shield, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word to cast the fear spell (save DC 13). The shield can't be used this way again until the next dusk.
