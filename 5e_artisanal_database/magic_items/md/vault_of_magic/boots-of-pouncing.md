# Boots of Pouncing

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

These soft leather boots have a collar made of Albino Death Weasel fur (see Creature Codex). While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 40 feet, unless your walking speed is higher. Your speed is still reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you can make one melee weapon attack against it as a bonus action.
