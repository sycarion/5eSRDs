# Radiance Bomb

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This small apple-sized globule is made from a highly reflective silver material and has a single, golden rune etched on it. Typically, 1d4 + 4 radiance bombs are found together. You can use an action to throw the globule up to 60 feet. The globule explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the globule landed must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. A blinded creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
