# Bottled Boat

- **Rarity:** Uncommon

This clear glass bottle contains a tiny replica of a wooden rowboat down to the smallest detail, including two stout oars, a miniature coil of hemp rope, a fishing net, and a small cask. You can use an action to break the bottle, destroying the bottle and releasing its contents. The rowboat and all of the items emerge as full-sized, normal, and permanent items of their type, which includes 50 feet of hempen rope, a cask containing 20 gallons of fresh water, two oars, and a 12-foot-long rowboat.
