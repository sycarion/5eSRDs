If you place 1 pound of honey inside this pot, the honey transforms into an ochre jelly after 24 hours. The jelly remains in a dormant state within the pot until you dump it out. You can use an action to dump the jelly from the pot in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. Once dumped, the ochre jelly is hostile to all creatures, including you. Only one ochre jelly can occupy the pot at a time.
