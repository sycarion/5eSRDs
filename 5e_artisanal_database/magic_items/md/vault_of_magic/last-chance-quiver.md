# Last Chance Quiver

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item

- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This quiver holds 20 arrows. However, when you draw and fire the last arrow from the quiver, it magically produces a 21st arrow. Once this arrow has been drawn and fired, the quiver doesn't produce another arrow until the quiver has been refilled and another 20 arrows have been drawn and fired.
