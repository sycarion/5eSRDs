You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. When you attack an object or structure with this magic lance and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target. The lance has 3 charges. As part of an attack action with the lance, you can expend a charge while striking a barrier created by a spell, such as a wall of fire or wall of force, or an entryway protected by the arcane lock spell. You must make a Strength check against a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends. The lance regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
