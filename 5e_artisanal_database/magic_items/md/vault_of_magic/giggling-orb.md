This glass sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and contains a swirling, yellow mist. You can use an action to throw the orb up to 60 feet. The orb shatters on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius of where the orb landed must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone in fits of laughter, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
