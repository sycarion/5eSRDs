# Box of Secrets

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This well-made, cubical box appears to be a normal container that can hold as much as a normal chest. However, each side of the chest is a lid that can be opened on cunningly concealed hinges. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the sides can be opened. When you use an action to turn the box so a new side is facing up, and speak the command word before opening the lid, the current contents of the chest slip into an interdimensional space, leaving it empty once more. You can use an action to fill the box again, then turn it over to a new side and open it, again sending the contents to the interdimensional space. This can be done up to six times, once for each side of the box. To gain access to a particular batch of contents, the correct side must be facing up, and you must use an action to speak the command word as you open the lid on that side. A box of secrets is often crafted with specific means of telling the sides apart, such as unique carvings on each side, or having each side painted a different color. If any side of the box is destroyed completely, the contents that were stored through that side are lost. Likewise, if the entire box is destroyed, the contents are lost forever.
