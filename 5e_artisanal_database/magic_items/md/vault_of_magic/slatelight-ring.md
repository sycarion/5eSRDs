This decorated thick gold band is adorned with a single polished piece of slate. While wearing this ring, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing this ring increases its range by 60 feet. In addition, you can use an action to cast the faerie fire spell (DC 15) from it. The ring can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
