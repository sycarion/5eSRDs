# Baba Yaga's Cinderskull

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Warm to the touch, this white, dry skull radiates dim, orange light from its eye sockets in a 30-foot radius. While attuned to the skull, you only require half of the daily food and water a creature of your size and type normally requires. In addition, you can withstand extreme temperatures indefinitely, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against extreme temperatures.
