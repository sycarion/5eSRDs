A withered snake's tongue floats in the shimmering gold liquid within this crystalline vial. When you drink this potion, you regain one expended spell slot or one expended use of a class feature, such as Divine Sense, Rage, Wild Shape, or other feature with limited uses. Until you finish a long rest, you can't speak a deliberate lie. You are aware of this effect after drinking the potion. Your words can be evasive, as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.
