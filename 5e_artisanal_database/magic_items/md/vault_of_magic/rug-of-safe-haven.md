This small, 3-foot-by-5-foot rug is woven with a tree motif and a tasseled fringe. While the rug is laid out on the ground, you can speak its command word as an action to create an extradimensional space beneath the rug for 1 hour. The extradimensional space can be reached by lifting a corner of the rug and stepping down as if through a trap door in a floor. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The entrance can be hidden by pulling the rug flat. Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window in the shape and style of the rug. Anything inside the extradimensional space is gently pushed out to the nearest unoccupied space when the duration ends. The rug can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
