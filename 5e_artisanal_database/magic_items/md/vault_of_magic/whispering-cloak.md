This cloak is made of black, brown, and white bat pelts sewn together. While wearing it, you have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet. While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you transform into a creature of pure shadow. While in shadow form, your Armor Class increases by 2, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. You can cast spells normally while in shadow form, but you can't make ranged or melee attacks with nonmagical weapons. In addition, you can't pick up objects, and you can't give objects you are wearing or carrying to others. This effect lasts up to 1 hour. Deduct time spent in shadow form in increments of 1 minute from the total time. After it has been used for 1 hour, the cloak can't be used in this way again until the next dusk, when its time limit resets. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
