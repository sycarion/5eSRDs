# Book Shroud

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

When not bound to a book, this red leather book cover is embossed with images of eyes on every inch of its surface. When you wrap this cover around a tome, it shifts the book's appearance to a plain red cover with a title of your choosing and blank pages on which you can write. When viewing the wrapped book, other creatures see the plain red version with any contents you've written. A creature succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check sees the real book and can remove the shroud.
