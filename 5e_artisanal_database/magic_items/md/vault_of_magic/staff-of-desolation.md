# Staff of Desolation

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit an object or structure with a melee attack using the staff, you deal double damage (triple damage on a critical hit). The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: thunderwave (1 charge), shatter (2 charges), circle of death (6 charges), disintegrate (6 charges), or earthquake (8 charges). The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
