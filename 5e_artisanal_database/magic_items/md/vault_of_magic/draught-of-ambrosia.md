# Draught of Ambrosia

- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Type:** Potion
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

The liquid in this tiny vial is golden and has a heady, floral scent. When you drink the draught, it fortifies your body and mind, removing any infirmity caused by old age. You stop aging and are immune to any magical and nonmagical aging effects. The magic of the ambrosia lasts ten years, after which time its power fades, and you are once again subject to the ravages of time and continue aging.
