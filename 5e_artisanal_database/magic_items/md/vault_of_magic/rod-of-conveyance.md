# Rod of Conveyance

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Rod
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

The top of this rod is capped with a bronze horse head, and its foot is decorated with a horsehair plume. By placing the rod between your legs, you can use an action to temporarily transform the rod into a horse-like construct. This works like the phantom steed spell, except you can use a bonus action to end the effect early to use the rod again at a later time. Deduct the time the horse was active in increments of 1 minute from the spell's 1-hour duration. When the rod has been a horse for a total of 1 hour, the magic ceases to function until the next dawn.
