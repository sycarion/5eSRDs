# Rod of the Jester

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Rod
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This wooden rod is decorated with colorful scarves and topped with a carving of a madly grinning head. Caper. While holding the rod, you can dance and perform general antics that attract attention. Make a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check. On a success, one creature that can see and hear you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you for 1 minute. The effect ends if the target can no longer see or hear you or if you are incapacitated. You can affect one additional creature for each 5 points by which you beat the DC (two creatures with a result of 15, three creatures with a result of 20, and so on). Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. Hideous Laughter. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast the hideous laughter spell (save DC 15) from it. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. Slapstick. You can use an action to swing the rod in the direction of a creature within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you and knocked prone. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the end of its next turn.
