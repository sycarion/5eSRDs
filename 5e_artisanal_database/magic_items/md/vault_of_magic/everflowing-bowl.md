This smooth, stone bowl feels especially cool to the touch. It holds up to 1 pint of water. When placed on the ground, the bowl magically draws water from the nearby earth and air, filling itself after 1 hour. In arid or desert environments, the bowl fills itself after 8 hours. The bowl never overflows itself.
