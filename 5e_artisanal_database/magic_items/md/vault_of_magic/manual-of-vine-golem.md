# Manual of Vine Golem

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a Vine Golem (see Tome of Beasts 2). To decipher and use the manual, you must be a druid with at least two 3rd-level spell slots. A creature that can't use a manual of vine golems and attempts to read it takes 4d6 psychic damage. To create a vine golem, you must spend 20 days working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also use powders made from rare plants and crushed gems worth 30,000 gp to create the vine golem, all of which are consumed in the process. Once you finish creating the vine golem, the book decays into ash. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.
