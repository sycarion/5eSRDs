# Ghost Dragon Horn

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Scales from dead dragons cover this wooden, curved horn. You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a blast in a 30-foot cone, containing shrieking spectral dragon heads. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature tales 5d10 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened. Dragons have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d10 psychic damage instead of 5d10. A frightened target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a dragon takes damage from the horn's shriek, the horn has a 20 percent chance of exploding. The explosion deals 10d10 psychic damage to the blower and destroys the horn. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until the next dawn. If you kill a dragon while holding or carrying the horn, you regain use of the horn.
