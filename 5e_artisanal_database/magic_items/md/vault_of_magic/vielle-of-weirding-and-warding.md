The strings of this bowed instrument never break. You must be proficient in stringed instruments to use this vielle. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d8 psychic damage. If you play the vielle as the somatic component for a spell that causes a target to become charmed on a failed saving throw, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.
