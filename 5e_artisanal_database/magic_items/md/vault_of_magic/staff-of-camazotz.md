# Staff of Camazotz

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This staff of petrified wood is topped with a stylized carving of a bat with spread wings, a mouth baring great fangs, and a pair of ruby eyes. It has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. As long as the staff holds at least 1 charge, you can communicate with bats as if you shared a language. Bat and bat-like beasts and monstrosities never attack you unless magically forced to do so or unless you attack them first. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: darkness (2 charges), dominate monster (8 charges), or flame strike (5 charges).
