# Band of Restraint

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

These simple leather straps are nearly unbreakable when used as restraints. If you spend 1 minute tying a Small or Medium creature's limbs with these straps, the creature is restrained (escape DC 17) until it escapes or until you speak a command word to release the straps. While restrained by these straps, the target has disadvantage on Strength checks.
