# Ash of the Ebon Birch

- **Rarity:** Uncommon

This salve is created by burning bark from a rare ebon birch tree then mixing that ash with oil and animal blood to create a cerise pigment used to paint yourself or another creature with profane protections. Painting the pigment on a creature takes 1 minute, and you can choose to paint a specific sigil or smear the pigment on a specific part of the creature's body.
