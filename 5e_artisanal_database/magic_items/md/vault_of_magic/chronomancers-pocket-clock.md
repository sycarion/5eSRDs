This golden pocketwatch has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. While holding it, you can use an action to wind it and expend 1 charge to cast the haste spell from it. If the pendant is destroyed (AC 14, 15 hit points) while it has 3 charges, the creature that broke it gains the effects of the time stop spell.
