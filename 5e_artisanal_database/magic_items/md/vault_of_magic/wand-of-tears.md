# Wand of Tears

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

The top half of this wooden wand is covered in thorns. The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and point the wand at a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to cry for 1 minute. Crying doesn't prevent a target from taking actions or moving. The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a Wand of Giggles  .
