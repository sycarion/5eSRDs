When you wear this burgundy face covering, it transforms your face into a shark-like visage, and the mask sprouts wicked horns. While wearing this mask, your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic bite. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks while wearing this mask.
