This simple wooden wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and point it at a body of water or other liquid. You learn the liquid's deepest point or its average depth (your choice). In addition, you can use an action to expend 1 charge while you are submerged in a liquid to determine how far you are beneath the liquid's surface.
