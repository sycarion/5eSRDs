This clay honeypot weighs 10 pounds. A sweet aroma wafts constantly from it, and it produces enough honey to feed up to 12 humanoids. Eating the honey restores 1d8 hit points, and the honey provides enough nourishment to sustain a humanoid for one day. Once 12 doses of the honey have been consumed, the honeypot can't produce more honey until the next dawn.
