# Fanged Mask

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This tribal mask is made of wood and adorned with animal fangs. Once donned, it melds to your face and causes fangs to sprout from your mouth. While wearing this mask, your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. If you already have a bite attack when you don and attune to this mask, your bite attack's damage dice double (for example, 1d4 becomes 2d4).
