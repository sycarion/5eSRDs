# Wand of Extinguishing

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This charred and blackened wooden wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to extinguish a nonmagical flame within 10 feet of you that is no larger than a small campfire. The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a wand of ignition.
