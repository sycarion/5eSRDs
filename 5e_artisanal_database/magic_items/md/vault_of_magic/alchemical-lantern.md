- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This hooded lantern has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dusk. While the lantern is lit, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cause the lantern to spit gooey alchemical fire at a creature you can see in the lantern's bright light. The lantern makes its attack roll with a +5 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
