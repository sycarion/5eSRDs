This spiked armor is a dark, almost black crimson when inactive. This more powerful version of hellfire armor has 3 charges. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend 1 charge as part of the action to make the armor glow, you can make the armor emit heat in addition to light for 1 minute. For the duration, when a creature touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, it takes 1d4 fire damage. You are immune to the armorâ€™s heat while wearing it.
