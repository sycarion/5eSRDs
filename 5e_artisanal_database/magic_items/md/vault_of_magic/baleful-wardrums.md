You must be proficient with percussion instruments to use these drums. The drums have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create a baleful rumble. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its next weapon or spell attack roll. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these drums for 24 hours. The drum regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
