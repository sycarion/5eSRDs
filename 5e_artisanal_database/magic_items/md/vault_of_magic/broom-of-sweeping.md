You can use an action to speak the broom's command word and give it short instructions consisting of a few words, such as “sweep the floor” or “dust the cabinets.” The broom can clean up to 5 cubic feet each minute and continues cleaning until you use another action to deactivate it. The broom can't climb barriers higher than 5 feet and can't open doors.
