This nondescript, smock-like garment changes its appearance on command. While wearing this shirt, you can use a bonus action to speak the shirt's command word and cause it to assume the appearance of a different set of clothing. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessoriesâ€”from filthy beggar's clothes to glittering court attire. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the shirt.
