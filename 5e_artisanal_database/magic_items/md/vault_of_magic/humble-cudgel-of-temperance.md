# Humble Cudgel of Temperance

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This simple, polished club has a studded iron band around one end. When you attack a poisoned creature with this magic weapon, you have advantage on the attack roll. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target becomes poisoned for 1 minute. If the target was already poisoned, it becomes incapacitated instead. The target can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned or incapacitated condition on itself on a success. Formerly a moneylender with a heart of stone and a small army of brutal thugs, Faustin the Drunkard awoke one day with a punishing hangover that seemed never-ending. He took this as a sign of punishment from the gods, not for his violence and thievery, but for his taste for the grape, in abundance. He decided all problems stemmed from the “demon” alcohol, and he became a cleric. No less brutal than before, he and his thugs targeted public houses, ale makers, and more. In his quest to rid the world of alcohol, he had the humble cudgel of temperance made and blessed with terrifying power. Now long since deceased, his simple, humble-appearing club continues to wreck havoc wherever it turns up.
