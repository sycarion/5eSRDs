# Black Phial

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This black stone phial has a tightly fitting stopper and 3 charges. As an action, you can fill the phial with blood taken from a living, or recently deceased (dead no longer than 1 minute), humanoid and expend 1 charge. When you do so, the black phial transforms the blood into a potion of greater healing. A creature who drinks this potion must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. The phial regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the phial's last charge, roll a d20: 1d20. On a 1, the phial crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
