This fist-sized ball of tightly-wound green fronds contains the bark of a magical plant with curative properties. A natural loop is formed from one of the fronds, allowing the charm to be hung from a pack, belt, or weapon pommel. As long as you carry this charm, whenever you are targeted by a spell or magical effect that restores your hit points, you regain an extra 1 hit point.
