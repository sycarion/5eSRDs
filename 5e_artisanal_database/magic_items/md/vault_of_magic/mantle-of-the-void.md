While wearing this midnight-blue mantle covered in writhing runes, you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws, and if you succeed on a saving throw against a spell that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half the damage or suffer partial effects, you instead take no damage and suffer none of the spell's effects.
