This perpetually blood-stained straight razor deals slashing damage instead of piercing damage. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Inhuman Alacrity. While holding the dagger, you can take two bonus actions on your turn, instead of one. Each bonus action must be different; you can’t use the same bonus action twice in a single turn. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dusk. Unclean Cut. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the dagger, you can use a bonus action to deal an extra 2d4 necrotic damage. If you do so, the target and each of its allies that can see this attack must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dusk.
