This elaborate headpiece is adorned with small gemstones and thin strips of gold that frame your head like a radiant halo. While you wear this headdress, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks. The headdress has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the headdress becomes a nonmagical, tawdry ornament of cheap metals and paste gems.
