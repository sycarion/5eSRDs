# Lightning Rod

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Rod
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This rod is made from the blackened wood of a lightning-struck tree and topped with a spike of twisted iron. It functions as a magic javelin that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you are immune to lightning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of you has resistance to lightning damage. The rod can hold up to 6 charges, but it has 0 charges when you first attune to it. Whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, the rod gains 1 charge. While the rod has 6 charges, you have resistance to lightning damage instead of immunity. The rod loses 1d6 charges daily at dawn.
