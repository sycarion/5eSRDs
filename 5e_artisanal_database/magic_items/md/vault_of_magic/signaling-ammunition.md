# Signaling Ammunition

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This magic ammunition creates a trail of light behind it as it flies through the air. If the ammunition flies through the air and doesn't hit a creature, it releases a burst of light that can be seen for up to 1 mile. If the ammunition hits a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in golden light until the end of its next turn. While the creature is outlined in light, it can't benefit from being invisible and any attack against it has advantage if the attacker can see the outlined creature.
