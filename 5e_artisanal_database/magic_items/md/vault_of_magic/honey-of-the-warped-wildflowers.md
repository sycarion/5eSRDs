# Honey of the Warped Wildflowers

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Potion
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This spirit honey is made from wildflowers growing in an area warped by magic, such as the flowers growing at the base of a wizard's tower or growing in a magical wasteland. When you consume this honey, you have resistance to psychic damage, and you have advantage on Intelligence saving throws. In addition, you can use an action to warp reality around one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be bewildered for 1 minute. At the start of a bewildered creature's turn, it must roll a die. On an even result, the creature can act normally. On an odd result, the creature is incapacitated until the start of its next turn as it becomes disoriented by its surroundings and unable to fully determine what is real and what isn't. You can't warp the reality around another creature in this way again until you finish a long rest.
