This massive, holy tome is bound in brass with a handle on the back cover. A steel chain dangles from the sturdy metal cover, allowing you to hang the tome from your belt or hook it to your armor. A locked clasp holds the tome closed, securing its contents. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wield this tome as a shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. Alternatively, you can make melee weapon attacks with the tome as if it was a club. If you make an attack using use the tome as a weapon, you lose the shield's bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.
