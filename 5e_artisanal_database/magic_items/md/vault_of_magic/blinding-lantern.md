# Blinding Lantern

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This ornate brass lantern comes fitted with heavily inscribed plates shielding the cut crystal lens. With a flick of a lever, as an action, the plates rise and unleash a dazzling array of lights at a single target within 30 feet. You must use two hands to direct the lights precisely into the eyes of a foe. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. A creature blinded by the lantern is immune to its effects for 1 minute afterward. This property can't be used in a brightly lit area. By opening the shutter on the opposite side, the device functions as a normal bullseye lantern, yet illuminates magically, requiring no fuel and giving off no heat.
