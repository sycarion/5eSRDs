What looks like a simple snuff box contains a magical, glowing ember. Though warm to the touch, the ember can be handled without damage. It can be used to ignite flammable materials quickly. Using it to light a torch, lantern, or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel takes a bonus action. Lighting any other fire takes an action. The ember is consumed when used. If the ember is consumed, the box creates a new ember at dawn.
