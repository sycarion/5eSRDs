# Loom of Fate

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

If you spend 1 hour weaving on this portable loom, roll a 1d20 and record the number rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. The loom can't be used this way again until the next dawn. Once you have used the loom 3 times, the fabric is complete, and the loom is no longer magical. The fabric becomes a shifting tapestry that represents the events where you used the loom's power to alter fate.
