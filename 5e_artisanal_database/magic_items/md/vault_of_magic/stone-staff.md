# Stone Staff

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Sturdy and smooth, this impressive staff is crafted from solid stone. Most stone staves are crafted by dwarf mages and few ever find their way into non-dwarven hands. The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: earthskimmer* (4 charges), entomb* (6 charges), flesh to stone (6 charges), meld into stone (3 charges), stone shape (4 charges), stoneskin (4 charges), or wall of stone (5 charges). You can also use an action to cast the pummelstone* or true strike spell from the staff without using any charges. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, hundreds of cracks appear across the staff 's surface and it crumbles into tiny bits of stone.
