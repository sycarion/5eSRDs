Made from woven lead and silver, this ring fits only on the hand's smallest finger. As the moon is a dull reflection of the sun's glory, so too is the power within this ring merely an imitation of the healing energies that can bestow true life. The ring has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to gain 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
