# Gliding Cloak

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

By grasping the ends of the cloak while falling, you can glide up to 5 feet horizontally in any direction for every 1 foot you fall. You descend 60 feet per round but take no damage from falling while gliding in this way. A tailwind allows you to glide 10 feet per 1 foot descended, but a headwind forces you to only glide 5 feet per 2 feet descended.
