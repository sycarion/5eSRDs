This deeply bitter, black, oily liquid deadens your sense of taste. When you drink this tonic, you can eat all manner of food without reaction, even if the food isn't to your liking, for 1 hour. During this time, you automatically fail Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on taste. This tonic doesn't protect you from the effects of consuming poisoned or spoiled food, but it can prevent you from detecting such impurities when you taste the food.
