# Earrings of the Eclipse

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

These two cubes of smoked quartz are mounted on simple, silver posts. While you are wearing these earrings, you can take the Hide action while you are motionless in an area of dim light or darkness even when a creature can see you or when you have nothing to obscure you from the sight of a creature that can see you. If you are in darkness when you use the Hide action, you have advantage on the Dexterity (Stealth) check. If you move, attack, cast a spell, or do anything other than remain motionless, you are no longer hidden and can be detected normally.
