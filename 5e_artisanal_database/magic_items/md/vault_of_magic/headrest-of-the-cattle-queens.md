This polished and curved wooden headrest is designed to keep the user's head comfortably elevated while sleeping. If you sleep at least 6 hours as part of a long rest while using the headrest, you regain 1 additional spent Hit Die, and your exhaustion level is reduced by 2 (rather than 1) when you finish the long rest.
