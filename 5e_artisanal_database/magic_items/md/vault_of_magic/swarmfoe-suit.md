While wearing this armor festooned with thin draconic scales, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can use the scales as a melee weapon while wearing the armor. You have proficiency with the scales and deal 1d4 slashing damage on a hit (your Strength modifier applies to the attack and damage rolls as normal). Swarms don't have resistance to the damage dealt by the scales. In addition, if a swarm occupies your space, you can attack with the scales as a bonus action.
