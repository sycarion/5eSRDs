While wielding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. When you would be struck by a ranged attack, you can use a reaction to cause the outer surface of the shield to emit a flash of magical energy, sending the missile hurtling back at your attacker. Make a ranged weapon attack roll against your attacker using the attacker's bonuses on the roll. If the attack hits, roll damage as normal, using the attacker's bonuses.
