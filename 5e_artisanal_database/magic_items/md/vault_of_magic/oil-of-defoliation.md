Sometimes known as weedkiller oil, this greasy amber fluid contains the crushed husks of dozens of locusts. One vial of the oily substance can coat one weapon or up to 5 pieces of ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to plants or plant creatures on a successful hit. The oil can also be applied directly to a willing, restrained, or immobile plant or plant creature. In this case, the substance deals 4d6 necrotic damage, which is enough to kill most ordinary plant life smaller than a large tree.
