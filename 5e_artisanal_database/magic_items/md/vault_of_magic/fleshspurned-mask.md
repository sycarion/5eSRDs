# Fleshspurned Mask

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This mask features inhumanly sized teeth similar in appearance to the toothy ghost known as a Fleshspurned (see Tome of Beasts 2). It has a strap fashioned from entwined strands of sinew, and it fits easily over your face with no need to manually adjust the strap. While wearing this mask, you can use its teeth to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the teeth deal necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, if the target has the Incorporeal Movement trait, you deal necrotic damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier instead. Such targets don't have resistance or immunity to the necrotic damage you deal with this attack. If you kill a creature with your teeth, you gain temporary hit points equal to double the creature's challenge rating (minimum of 1).
