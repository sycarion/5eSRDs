# Staff of Feathers

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Several eagle feathers line the top of this long, thin staff. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes into a mass of eagle feathers and is destroyed. Feather Travel. When you are targeted by a ranged attack while holding the staff, you can use a reaction to teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. When you do, you briefly transform into a mass of feathers, and the attack misses. Once used, this property canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn. Spells. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: conjure animals (2 giant eagles only, 3 charges), fly (3 charges), or gust of wind (2 charges).
