As an action, you can rub this dull green cream over your skin. When you do, you sprout thick, olive-green scales like those of a giant lizard or green dragon that last for 1 hour. These scales give you a natural AC of 15 + your Constitution modifier. This natural AC doesn't combine with any worn armor or with a Dexterity bonus to AC. A jar of scalehide cream contains 1d6 + 1 doses.
