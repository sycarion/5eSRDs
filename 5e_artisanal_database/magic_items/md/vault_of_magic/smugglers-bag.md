# Smuggler's Bag

This leather-bottomed, draw-string canvas bag appears to be a sturdy version of a common sack. If you use an action to speak the command word while holding the bag, all the contents within shift into an extradimensional space, leaving the bag empty. The bag can then be filled with other items. If you speak the command word again, the bag's current contents transfer into the extradimensional space, and the items in the extradimensional space transfer to the bag. The extradimensional space and the bag itself can each hold up to 1 cubic foot of items or 30 pounds of gear.
