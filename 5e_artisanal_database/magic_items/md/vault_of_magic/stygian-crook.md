# Stygian Crook

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This staff of gnarled, rotted wood ends in a hooked curvature like a twisted shepherd's crook. The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: bestow curse (3 charges), blight (4 charges), contagion (5 charges), false life (1 charge), or hallow (5 charges). The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to live maggots and is destroyed.
