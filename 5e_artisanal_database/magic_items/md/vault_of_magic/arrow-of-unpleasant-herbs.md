# Arrow of Unpleasant Herbs

- **Rarity:** Uncommon

This arrow's tip is filled with magically preserved, poisonous herbs. When a creature takes damage from the arrow, the arrowhead breaks, releasing the herbs. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it retches and reels from the poison.
