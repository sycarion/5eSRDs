This gray polish is viscous and difficult to spread. The polish can coat one metal weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Applying the polish takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item hardens and becomes stronger, and it counts as an adamantine weapon for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to attacks and damage not made with adamantine weapons.
