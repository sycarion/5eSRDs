When you are attacked or are the target of a spell while holding this magically enhanced flower, you can use a reaction to blow on the flower. It explodes in a flurry of seeds that distracts your attacker, and you add 1 to your AC against the attack or to your saving throw against the spell. Afterwards, the flower wilts and becomes nonmagical.
