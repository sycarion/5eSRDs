This pearlescent fluid perpetually swirls inside its container with a slow kaleidoscopic churn. When you drink this potion, you can cast the guidance spell for 1 hour at will. You can end this effect early as an action and gain the effects of the augury spell. If you do, you are afflicted with short-term madness after learning the spell's results.
