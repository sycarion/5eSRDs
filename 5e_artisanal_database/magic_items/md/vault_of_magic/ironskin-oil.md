This grayish fluid is cool to the touch and slightly gritty. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature has resistance to piercing and slashing damage for 1 hour.
