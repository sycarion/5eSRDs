This carved piece of semiprecious stone typically takes the form of an angelic figure or a shield carved with a protective rune, and it is commonly worn attached to clothing or around the neck on a chain or cord. While wearing the stone, you have brief premonitions of danger and gain a +2 bonus to initiative if you aren't incapacitated.
