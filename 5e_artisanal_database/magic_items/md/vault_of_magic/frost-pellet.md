# Frost Pellet

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Fashioned from the stomach lining of a Devil Shark (see Creature Codex), this rubbery pellet is cold to the touch. When you consume the pellet, you feel bloated, and you are immune to cold damage for 1 hour. Once before the duration ends, you can expel a 30-foot cone of cold water. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 6d8 cold damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed away.
