# Wand of Windows

This clear, crystal wand has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge and touch the wand to any nonmagical object. The wand causes a portion of the object, up to 1-foot square and 6 inches deep, to become transparent for 1 minute. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand. The wand regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the wand slowly becomes cloudy until it is completely opaque and becomes nonmagical.
