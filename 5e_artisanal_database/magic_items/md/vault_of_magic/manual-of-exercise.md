# Manual of Exercise

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This book contains exercises and techniques to better perform a specific physical task, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 24 hours over a period of 3 days or fewer studying the tome and practicing its instructions, you gain proficiency in the Strength or Dexterity-based skill (such as Athletics or Stealth) associated with the book. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in ten years.
