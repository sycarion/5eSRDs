A large, orange cat's eye gem is held in the fittings of this ornate silver ring, looking as if it is grasped by scaled talons. While wearing this ring, your senses are sharpened. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and you can take the Search action as a bonus action.
