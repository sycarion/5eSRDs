# Burning Skull

- **Rarity:** Very Rare

- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This appallingly misshapen skull—though alien and monstrous in aspect—is undeniably human, and it is large and hollow enough to be worn as a helm by any Medium humanoid. The skull helm radiates an unholy spectral aura, which sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. According to legends, gazing upon a burning skull freezes the blood and withers the brain of one who understands not its mystery.
