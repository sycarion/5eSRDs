This slim, metal wand is topped with a cage shaped like a three-sided pyramid. An eye of glass sits within the pyramid. The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the guidance spell from it. The wand regains all expended charges at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a Wand of Resistance.
