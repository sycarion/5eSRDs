# Bookkeeper Inkpot

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This glass vessel looks like an ordinary inkpot. A quill fashioned from an ostrich feather accompanies the inkpot. You can use an action to speak the inkpot's command word, targeting a Bookkeeper (see Creature Codex) that you can see within 10 feet of you. An unwilling bookkeeper must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be transferred to the inkpot, making you the bookkeeper's new “creator.” While the bookkeeper is contained within the inkpot, it suffers no harm due to being away from its bound book, but it can't use any of its actions or traits that apply to it being in a bound book. Dipping the quill in the inkpot and writing in a book binds the bookkeeper to the new book. If the inkpot is found as treasure, there is a 50 percent chance it contains a bookkeeper. An identify spell reveals if a bookkeeper is inside the inkpot before using the inkpot's ink.
