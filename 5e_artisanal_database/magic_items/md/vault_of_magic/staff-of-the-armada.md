While you are on board a ship, this bonus increases to +2. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses all of its magic and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff. Spells. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: control water (4 charges), fog cloud (1 charge), gust of wind (2 charges), or water walk (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the ray of frost cantrip from the staff without using any charges.
