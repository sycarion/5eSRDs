This thin wand is fashioned from the fiendish quill of a barbed devil. While attuned to it, you have resistance to cold damage. The wand has 6 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into cinders and is destroyed. Hurl Flame. While holding the wand, you can expend 2 charges as an action to hurl a ball of devilish flame at a target you can see within 150 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity check or take 3d6 fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire. Devil's Sight. While holding the wand, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the darkvision spell on yourself. Magical darkness doesn't impede this darkvision.
