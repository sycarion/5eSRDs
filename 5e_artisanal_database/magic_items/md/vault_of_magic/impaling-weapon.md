When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you embed the weapon in the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and is within 5 feet of a wall or other solid object when you hit with this weapon, it is also restrained while the weapon is embedded. At the end of the target's turn while the weapon is embedded in it, the target takes damage equal to the weapon's damage, with no additional modifiers. A creature, including the target, can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, removing the weapon from the target on a success. You can remove the embedded weapon from the target by speaking the weapon's command word.
