# Gale Javelin

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

The metallic head of this javelin is embellished with three small wings. When you speak a command word while making a ranged weapon attack with this magic weapon, a swirling vortex of wind follows its path through the air. Draw a line between you and the target of your attack; each creature within 10 feet of this line must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed backward 10 feet and falls prone. In addition, if this ranged weapon attack hits, the target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed backward 15 feet and falls prone. The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, it can still be used as a magic weapon.
