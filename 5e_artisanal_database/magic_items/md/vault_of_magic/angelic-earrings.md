These earrings feature platinum loops from which hang bronzed claws from a Chamrosh (see Tome of Beasts 2), freely given by the angelic hound. While wearing these earrings, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine if a creature is lying or if it has an evil alignment. If you cast detect evil and good while wearing these earrings, the range increases to 60 feet, and the spell lasts 10 minutes without requiring concentration.
