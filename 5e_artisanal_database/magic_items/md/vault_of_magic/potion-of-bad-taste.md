# Potion of Bad Taste

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Potion
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This brown, sludgy potion tastes extremely foul. When you drink this potion, the taste of your flesh is altered to be unpalatable for 1 hour. During this time, if a creature hits you with a bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or spend its next action gagging and retching. A creature with an Intelligence of 4 or lower avoids biting you again unless compelled or commanded by an outside force or if you attack it.
