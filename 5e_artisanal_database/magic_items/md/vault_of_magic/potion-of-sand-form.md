# Potion of Sand Form

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Potion
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This potion's container holds a gritty liquid that moves and pours like water filled with fine particles of sand. When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. While in this gaseous form, your appearance is that of a vortex of spiraling sand instead of a misty cloud. In addition, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in a sandy environment, and, while motionless in a sandy environment, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary swirl of sand.
