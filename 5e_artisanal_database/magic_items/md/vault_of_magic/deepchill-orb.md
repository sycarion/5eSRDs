# Deepchill Orb

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This fist-sized sphere of blue quartz emits cold. If placed in a container with a capacity of up to 5 cubic feet, it keeps the internal temperature of the container at a consistent 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This can keep liquids chilled, preserve cooked foods for up to 1 week, raw meats for up to 3 days, and fruits and vegetables for weeks. If you hold the orb without gloves or other insulating method, you take 1 cold damage each minute you hold it. At the GM's discretion, the orb's cold can be applied to other uses, such as keeping it in contact with a hot item to cool down the item enough to be handled, wrapping it and using it as a cooling pad to bring down fever or swelling, or similar.
