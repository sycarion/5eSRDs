When you drink this potion, your skin glows with radiance, and you are filled with joy and bliss for 1 minute. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. While glowing, you are blinded and have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. If a creature with the Sunlight Sensitivity trait starts its turn in the bright light you shed, it takes 2d4 radiant damage. This potion's golden liquid sparkles with motes of sunlight.
