While wearing this scarf, you appear different to everyone who looks upon you for less than 1 minute. In addition, you smell, sound, feel, and taste different to every creature that perceives you. Creatures with truesight or blindsight can see your true form, but their other senses are still confounded. If a creature studies you for 1 minute, it can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, it perceives your real form.
