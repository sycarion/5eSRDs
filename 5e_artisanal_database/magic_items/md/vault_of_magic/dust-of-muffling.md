# Dust of Muffling

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

You can scatter this fine, silvery-gray dust on the ground as an action, covering a 10-foot-square area. There is enough dust in one container for up to 5 uses. When a creature moves over an area covered in the dust, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to remain unheard. The effect remains until the dust is swept up, blown away, or tracked away by the traffic of eight or more creatures passing through the area.
