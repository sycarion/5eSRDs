# Honey Trap

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This jar is made of beaten metal and engraved with honeybees. It has 7 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the jar's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the jar shatters and loses all its magical properties. While holding the jar, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to hurl a glob of honey at a target within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands, and the creature is restrained. A creature restrained by the honey can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the honey.
