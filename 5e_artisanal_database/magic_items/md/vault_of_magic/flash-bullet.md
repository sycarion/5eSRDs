When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this shiny, polished stone, it releases a sudden flash of bright light. The target takes damage as normal and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Creatures with the Sunlight Sensitivity trait have disadvantage on this saving throw.
