A favored weapon of hill giants, this greatclub appears to be little more than a thick tree branch. When you hit a giant with this magic weapon, the giant takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.
