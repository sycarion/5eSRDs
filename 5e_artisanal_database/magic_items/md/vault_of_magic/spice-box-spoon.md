This lacquered wooden spoon carries an entire cupboard within its smooth contours. When you swirl this spoon in any edible mixture, such as a drink, stew, porridge, or other dish, it exudes a flavorful aroma and infuses the mixture. This culinary wonder mimics any imagined variation of simple seasonings, from salt and pepper to aromatic herbs and spice blends. These flavors persist for 1 hour.
