# Staff of Scrying

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This is a graceful, highly polished wooden staff crafted from willow. A crystal ball tops the staff, and smooth gold bands twist around its shaft. This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: detect thoughts (2 charges), locate creature (4 charges), locate object (2 charges), scrying (5 charges), or true seeing (6 charges). The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a bright flash of light erupts from the crystal ball, and the staff vanishes.
