# Crusader's Shield

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

A bronze boss is set in the center of this round shield. When you attune to the shield, the boss changes shape, becoming a symbol of your divine connection: a holy symbol for a cleric or paladin or an engraving of mistletoe or other sacred plant for a druid. You can use the shield as a spellcasting focus for your spells.
