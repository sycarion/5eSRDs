If this small, copper cauldron is filled with water and a half pound of meat, vegetables, or other foodstuffs then placed over a fire, it produces a simple, but hearty stew that provides one creature with enough nourishment to sustain it for one day. As long as the food is kept within the cauldron with the lid on, the food remains fresh and edible for up to 24 hours, though it grows cold unless reheated.
