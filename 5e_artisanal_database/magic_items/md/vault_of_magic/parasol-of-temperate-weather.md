# Parasol of Temperate Weather

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This fine, cloth-wrapped 2-foot-long pole unfolds into a parasol with a diameter of 3 feet, which is large enough to cover one Medium or smaller creature. While traveling under the parasol, you ignore the drawbacks of traveling in hot weather or a hot environment. Though it protects you from the sun's heat in the desert or geothermal heat in deep caverns, the parasol doesn't protect you from damage caused by super-heated environments or creatures, such as lava or an azer's Heated Body trait, or magic that deals fire damage, such as the fire bolt spell.
