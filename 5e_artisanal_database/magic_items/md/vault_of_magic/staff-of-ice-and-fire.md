# Staff of Ice and Fire

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Made from the branch of a white ash tree, this staff holds a sapphire at one end and a ruby at the other. The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: flaming sphere (2 charges), freezing sphere (6 charges), sleet storm (3 charges), or wall of fire (4 charges). The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff and its gems crumble into ash and snow and are destroyed.
