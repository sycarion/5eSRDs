# Soul Jug

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

If you unstopper the jug, your soul enters it. This works like the magic jar spell, except it has a duration of 9 hours and the jug acts as the gem. The jug must remain unstoppered for you to move your soul to a nearby body, back to the jug, or back to your own body. Possessing a target is an action, and your target can foil the attempt by succeeding on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. Only one soul can be in the jug at a time. If a soul is in the jug when the duration ends, the jug shatters.
