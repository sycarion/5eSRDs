# Mirrored Armor

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This metal armor is always polished to a mirror sheen, highly reflective, and can't be dulled. If a creature has an action or trait that requires it to gaze at you to affect you, such as a basilisk's Petrifying Gaze or a lich's Frightening Gaze, it sees its reflection in the armor and is also affected by the gaze.
