You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a humanoid with this weapon, the humanoid takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage. If you use the axe to damage a plant creature or an object made of wood, the axe's blade liquifies into harmless honey, and it can't be used again until 24 hours have passed.
