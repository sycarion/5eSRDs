This arrow has bright red fletching and a blunt, red tip. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic arrow. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, but it paints a magical red dot on the target for 1 minute. While the dot lasts, the target takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type from any ranged attack that hits it. In addition, ranged weapon attacks against the target score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. When this arrow hits a target, the arrow vanishes in a flash of red light and is destroyed.
