# Gremlin's Paw

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This wand is fashioned from the fossilized forearm and claw of a gremlin. The wand has 5 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 15): bane (1 charge), bestow curse (3 charges), or hideous laughter (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted with short-term madness. On a 1, the rod crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
