These boots are often decorated with eyes, flames, or other bold patterns such as lightning bolts or wheels. When you step onto water, air, or stone, you can use a reaction to speak the boots' command word. For 1 hour, you gain the effects of the meld into stone, water walk, or wind walk spell, depending on the type of surface where you stepped. The boots can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
