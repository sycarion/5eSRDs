# Chamrosh Salve

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This 3-inch-diameter ceramic jar contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a syrupy mixture that smells faintly of freshly washed dog fur. The jar is a glorious gold-white, resembling the shimmering fur of a Chamrosh (see Tome of Beasts 2), the holy hound from which this salve gets its name. As an action, one dose of the ointment can be applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 1 hit points and is cured of the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.
