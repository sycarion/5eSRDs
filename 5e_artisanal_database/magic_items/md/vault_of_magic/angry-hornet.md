# Angry Hornet

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This black ammunition has yellow fletching or yellow paint. When you fire this magic ammunition, it makes an angry buzzing sound, and it multiplies in flight. As it flies, 2d4 identical pieces of ammunition magically appear around it, all speeding toward your target. Roll separate attack rolls for each additional arrow or bullet. Duplicate ammunition disappears after missing or after dealing its damage. If the angry hornet and all its duplicates miss, the angry hornet remains magical and can be fired again, otherwise it is destroyed.
