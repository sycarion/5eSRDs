# Cephalopod Breastplate

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This bronze breastplate depicts two krakens fighting. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can use an action to speak the armor's command word to release a cloud of black mist (if above water) or black ink (if underwater). It billows out from you in a 20-foot-radius cloud of mist or ink. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) or a significant current disperses it. The armor can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
