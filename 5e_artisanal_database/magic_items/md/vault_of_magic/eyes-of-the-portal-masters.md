While you wear these crystal lenses over your eyes, you can sense the presence of any dimensional portal within 60 feet of you and whether the portal is one-way or two-way. Once you have worn the eyes for 10 minutes, their magic ceases to function until the next dawn. Putting the lenses on or off requires an action.
