# Staff of Portals

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

This iron-shod wooden staff is heavily worn, and it can be wielded as a quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses all of its magic and becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: arcane lock (2 charges), dimension door (4 charges), knock (2 charges), or passwall (5 charges).
