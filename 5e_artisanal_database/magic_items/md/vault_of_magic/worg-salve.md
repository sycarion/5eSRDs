Brewed by hags and lycanthropes, this oil grants you lupine features. Each pot contains enough for three applications. One application grants one of the following benefits (your choice): darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell, a walking speed of 50 feet, or a new attack option (use the statistics of a wolf 's bite attack) for 5 minutes. If you use all three applications at one time, you can cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a wolf. While you are in the form of a wolf, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don't need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die.
