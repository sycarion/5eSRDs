# Soldra's Staff

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Vault of Magic

Crafted by a skilled wizard and meant to be a spellcaster's last defense, this staff is 5 feet long, made of yew wood that curves at its top, is iron shod at its mid-section, and capped with a silver dragon's claw that holds a lustrous, though rough and uneven, black pearl. When you make an attack with this staff, it howls and whistles hauntingly like the wind. When you cast a spell from this staff, it chirps like insects on a hot summer night. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It has 3 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: faerie fire (1 charge) or gust of wind (2 charges). The staff regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Once daily, it can regain 1 expended charge by exposing the staff 's pearl to moonlight for 1 minute.
