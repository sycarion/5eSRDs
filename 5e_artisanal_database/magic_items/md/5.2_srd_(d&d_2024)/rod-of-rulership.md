# Rod of Rulership

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Rod
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** 5.2 SRD (D&D 2024)

You can take a Magic action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8 hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this way. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
