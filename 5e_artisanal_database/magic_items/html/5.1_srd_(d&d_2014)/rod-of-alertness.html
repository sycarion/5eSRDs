<p>This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alertness</em></strong>. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: <em>detect evil and good</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>detect poison and disease</em>, or <em>see invisibility.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Protective Aura</em></strong>. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.</p>
<p>The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/5.1_srd_(d&d_2014)/rod-of-alertness.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
