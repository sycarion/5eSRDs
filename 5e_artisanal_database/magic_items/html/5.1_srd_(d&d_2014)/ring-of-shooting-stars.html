<h1>Ring of Shooting Stars</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Ring</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> 5.1 SRD (D&amp;D 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast <em>dancing lights</em> and <em>light</em> from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.</p>
<p>The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Faerie Fire</em></strong>. You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast <em>faerie fire</em> from the ring.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ball Lightning</em></strong>. You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.</p>
<p>Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shooting Stars</em></strong>. You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/5.1_srd_(d&d_2014)/ring-of-shooting-stars.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
