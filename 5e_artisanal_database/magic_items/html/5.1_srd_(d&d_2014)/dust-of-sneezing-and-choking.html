<p>Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be <em>dust of disappearance</em>, and an <em>identify</em> spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.</p>
<p>When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The <em>lesser restoration</em> spell can also end the effect on a creature.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/5.1_srd_(d&d_2014)/dust-of-sneezing-and-choking.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
