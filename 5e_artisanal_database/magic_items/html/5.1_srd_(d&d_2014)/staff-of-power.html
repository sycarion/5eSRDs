<h1>Staff of Power</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> 5.1 SRD (D&amp;D 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.</p>
<p>The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.</p>
<p><strong><em>Power Strike</em></strong>. When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: <em>cone of cold</em> (5 charges), <em>fireball</em> (5th-level version, 5 charges), <em>globe of invulnerability</em> (6 charges), <em>hold monster</em> (5 charges), <em>levitate</em> (2 charges), <em>lightning bolt</em> (5th-level version, 5 charges), <em>magic missile</em> (1 charge), <em>ray of enfeeblement</em> (1 charge), or <em>wall of force</em> (5 charges).</p>
<p><strong><em>Retributive Strike</em></strong>. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.</p>
<p>You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p>
