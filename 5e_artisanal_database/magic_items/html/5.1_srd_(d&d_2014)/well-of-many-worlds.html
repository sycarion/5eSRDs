<h1>Well of Many Worlds</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Legendary</li>

</ul>
<p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>You can use an action to unfold and place the <em>well of many worlds</em> on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once <em>well of many worlds</em> has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/5.1_srd_(d&d_2014)/well-of-many-worlds.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
