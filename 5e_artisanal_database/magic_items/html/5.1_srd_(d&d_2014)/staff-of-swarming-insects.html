<h1>Staff of Swarming Insects</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> 5.1 SRD (D&amp;D 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>giant insect</em> (4 charges) or <em>insect plague</em> (5 charges).</p>
<p><strong><em>Insect Cloud</em></strong>. While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/5.1_srd_(d&d_2014)/staff-of-swarming-insects.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
