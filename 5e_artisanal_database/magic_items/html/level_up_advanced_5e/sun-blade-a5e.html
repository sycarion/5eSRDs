<h1>Sun Blade</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Weapon</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This weapon first appears to be nothing more than a sword hilt. While holding the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of sunlight appear or disappear. Being proficient in shortswords or longswords grants proficiency with this magic sword, which also has the finesse property as long as the blade is in existence.</p>
<p>While the blade is ignited, you gain +2 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  made with it, dealing 1d8 radiant damage on a hit (instead of slashing damage), or 2d8 radiant damage if your target is undead.</p>
<p>The blade shines with <em>bright sunlight</em>  in a 15-foot radius and dim sunlight for an additional 15 feet. You can use an action to increase or decrease the bright sunlight and dim sunlight radiuses by 5 feet, up to a maximum of 30 feet each or down to a minimum of 10 feet each.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/sun-blade-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
