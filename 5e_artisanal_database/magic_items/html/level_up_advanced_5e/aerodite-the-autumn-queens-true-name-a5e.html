<h1>Aerodite the Autumn Queen’s True Name</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name “Airy Nightengale” surrounded by shifting autumn leaves. While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this parchment to summon a vision of a powerful <em>archfey</em>  beside you for 1 minute. Airy acts catty and dismissive but mellows with flattery. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Perform minor acts of nature magic (as <em>druidcraft</em> ).</li>
<li>Whisper charming words to a target creature within 5 feet. Creatures whispered to in this way must make a DC 13 Charisma <em>saving throw</em> , on a failed save targets become <em>charmed</em>  by the vision until the end of their next turn, treating the vision and you as friendly allies.</li>
<li>Bestow a magical fly speed of 10 feet on a creature within 5 feet for as long as the vision remains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Aerodite in exchange for her direct assistance. When you do so the parchment disappears in a flurry of autumn leaves, and for the next minute the figment transforms into an alluring vision of the Dreaming at a point you choose within 60 feet (as __hypnotic pattern_ , save DC 13). Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Aerodite’s true name again.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/aerodite-the-autumn-queens-true-name-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
