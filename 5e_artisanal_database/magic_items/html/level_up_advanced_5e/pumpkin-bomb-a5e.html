<p>This pale white pumpkin is small enough to fit in the palm of a human hand. A macabre, grinning face is carved into one side, and a candle within burns an eerie purple flame. While its candle is lit, this pumpkin lantern shines <em>dim light</em>  in a 10-foot radius. The lantern’s candle burns for 1 minute, after which the pumpkin instantly rots and loses its magic.</p>
<p>Undead must make a DC 12 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  when entering the radius or when beginning their turn within the pumpkin’s light, taking 3d6 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Incorporeal undead have <em>disadvantage</em>  on this saving throw.</p>
<p>The pumpkin has AC 8 and 2 hit points. If the pumpkin is destroyed, all undead within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em> , taking 6d6 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a success.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/pumpkin-bomb-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
