<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword.</p>
<p>The sword has 1d8+1 charges. When you use the sword to score a critical hit against a creature that is not a construct or undead, if it has less than 100 hit points it makes a DC 15 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or it instantly dies as the sword rips the life force out of it. Each time a creature is killed in this manner the sword expends a charge. When all its charges are gone, the sword loses this property. </p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/nine-lives-stealer-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
