<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic maul. This weapon can only be attuned to when you are wearing a __belt of giant strength_ and __gauntlets of ogre power ._ The attunement ends if you remove or change attunement away from either of those items. </p>

<ul>
<li>Your Strength score increases by 4 (and can exceed 20, but not 30).</li>
<li>When you make an attack roll with this weapon against a giant and roll a natural 20, the giant makes a DC 17 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or dies.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the maul with a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet. On a hit, the maul unleashes a thunderclap heard from up to 300 feet away. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it make a DC 17 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or become <em>stunned</em>  until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>The maul has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/hammer-of-thunderbolts-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
