<p>After being held in your hand for 1 round, this scarab medallion shimmers with magical inscriptions. The scarab has 12 charges, crumbling into dust when it has no charges left. </p>
<p>This item has two benefits while it is on your person. First, you gain <em>advantage</em>  on <em>saving throws</em>  made against spells. Second, if you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or either an attack from or trait of an undead creature, you may instead succeed on the saving throw by using your reaction to expend a charge from the scarab.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/scarab-of-protection-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
