<h1>Perfume Vile</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a bonus action to spray perfume from this fashionable bottle, immediately dispelling any foul odors on a creature or object of Large size or smaller and leaving behind only the faint smell of peonies that lasts for 1d4 hours. The bottle has enough perfume in it for 20 sprays.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use an action to throw the bottle at a point within 30 feet, creating a 20-foot radius sphere of pink gas centered where it hits. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for 1d4 rounds. A creature that enters the area or starts its turn there makes a Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  (DC equal to the number of perfume sprays remaining) or it takes 1d4 poison damage and becomes stunned for 1 round. Creatures already wearing the perfume have <em>advantage</em>  on this saving throw.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/perfume-vile-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
