<p>This bow whispers its urgent desire for the quick defeat of your enemies in Elvish when you nock an arrow. When you use this bow to make a <em>ranged weapon attack</em>  against a creature, you can swear an oath against the target of your attack and make it your sworn enemy until its death or dawn seven days later. You may choose a new sworn enemy following the next dawn after your current sworn enemy dies. </p>
<p>Your ranged weapon attacks using this bow have advantage against your sworn enemy, and your sworn enemy cannot gain benefit from cover other than <em>total cover</em> . You do not have <em>disadvantage</em>  on ranged weapon attacks with the bow that are at long range as long as your sworn enemy is your target, and on a hit your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.</p>
<p>You have <em>disadvantage</em>  on attacks made with weapons other than this bow while your sworn enemy lives.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/oathbow-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
