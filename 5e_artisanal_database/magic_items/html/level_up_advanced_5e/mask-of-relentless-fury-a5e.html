<h1>Mask of Relentless Fury</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This cracked marble mask bears a toothy, unsettling grin. It perfectly fits over its wearer’s face, and though it lacks eyeholes an attuned wearer can see through it without issue.</p>
<p>While wearing this mask, you can’t be <em>blinded</em> , <em>charmed</em> , or <em>frightened</em> , and you are immune to any effect that could be avoided by averting your eyes, such as a <em>medusa’s</em> <em>Petrifying Gaze</em>. Insight checks against you are made with <em>disadvantage</em> .</p>
<p>Using a bonus action, you can enter a fury that makes you far more dangerous. While in a fury, you gain the following benefits for the next minute, until you go <em>unconscious</em> , or until you end your fury willingly (see below):</p>
<ul>
<li>You may take an additional action on each of your turns. This action can be used to make a single weapon attack, or to take the Dash or Use an Object action.</li>
<li>You gain a fury score, which starts at 0 and increases by 1 at the start of each turn. Whenever you take damage, you reduce the damage by your fury score after applying any <em>resistances</em> .</li>
<li>You ignore the effects of <em>fatigue</em> .</li>
</ul>
<p>At the start of any future turn, after increasing your fury score, you can choose to end this fury. When your fury ends, you are <em>stunned</em>  until the end of your turn. Roll 1d8. If the result is equal to or lower than your fury score, gain <em>fatigue</em>  equal to the result. Your fury score then resets to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> If you gain seven levels of fatigue while wearing this mask, you don’t die. Instead, the mask takes control of your body. You clear all <em>exhaustion</em> , then use your turn to move toward the nearest creature and attack. You continue in this rampage, seeking more foes until killed, at which point your attunement ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Escalation.</em></strong> Each time you achieve a fury score of 7 or higher and survive, you gain a new property from the following list. For each of these properties you gain, your starting fury score increases by 1.</p>
<p><em>Marble Flesh.</em> Each time you increase your fury score, your skin hardens, allowing you to ignore the first source of damage you take before the start of your next turn.</p>
<p><em>Unstoppable.</em> When you increase your fury score you can end one effect on yourself that causes you to become <em>incapacitated</em> .</p>
<p><em>Witchbane.</em> Choose a classical school of magic. You have <em>advantage</em>  on <em>saving throws</em>  against spells of that school and related magical effects.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/mask-of-relentless-fury-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
