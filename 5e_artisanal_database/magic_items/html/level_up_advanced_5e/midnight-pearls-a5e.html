<p>These lustrous black pearl earrings would look at home on a socialite but are rumored to have originated with a treacherous pirate captain. They always appear wet and give the air nearby the slightest taste of saltwater. You do not require pierced ears to wear the earrings and when placed against the lobe they naturally stick to your skin. In addition to being highly fashionable, they can also help escape a tough jam. </p>
<p>You can use an action to drop and stomp on one of these earrings, destroying it as a cloud of <em>darkness</em>  erupts in a 5-foot radius and extends 10 feet in every direction for 1d4 rounds.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/midnight-pearls-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
