<h1>Apparatus of the Crab</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Legendary</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>

</ul>
<p>This ingeniously crafted item (known by some as the crabaratus) is a tightly shut 500 pound iron barrel. Making a DC 20 Investigation check reveals a hidden catch which unlocks one end of the barrel—a hatch. Two Medium or smaller creatures can crawl inside where there are 10 levers in a row at the far end. Each lever is in a neutral position but can move up or down. Use of these levers makes the barrel reconfigure to resemble a giant metal crab.</p>
<p>This item is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>
<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 20</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 200</p>
<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (both are 0 ft. without legs and tail extended)</p>
<p><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> poison, psychic</p>
<p>The item requires a pilot to be used as a vehicle. The hatch must be closed for it to be airtight and watertight. The apparatus holds 10 hours worth of air for breathing, dividing by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
<p>The apparatus floats on water and may dive underwater down to 900 feet, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage at the end of each minute spent at a lower depth.</p>
<p>Any creature inside the apparatus can use an action to position up to two of the levers either up or down, with the lever returning to its neutral position upon use. From left to right, the Apparatus of the Crab table shows how each lever functions.</p>
