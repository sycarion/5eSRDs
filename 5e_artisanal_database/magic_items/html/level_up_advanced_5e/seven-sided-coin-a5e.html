<p>The origins of this dull gray coin are impossible to identify. Though when observed the coin has only two sides, flipping it yields one of 7 different results. You can flip the coin as an action. The effects of the flip last for 10 minutes or until you flip the coin again. Roll a d8 to determine the result: </p>
