<h1>Figurine of Wondrous Power</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>

</ul>
<p>These small, palm-sized figurines of various animals run the entire gamut of artistic skill—some sculpted down to the last hair of detail and some looking more like the product of carvings by a drunkard.</p>
<p>The specifics of these figurines vary but they all work in essentially the same way: if you use an action to speak the appropriate command word and throw the figurine at a point within 60 feet, it transforms into a living creature the color of its original material. If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.</p>
<p>The resulting creature is friendly to you and your companions, with a notable exception listed below. It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.</p>
<p>Each creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a duration specific to each creature, as detailed in its entry.</p>

<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>The goat of terror</em> becomes a Large goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a   <em>1 lance</em> , and the other becomes a   <em>2 longsword</em> . Removing a horn requires an action and the weapons disappear when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates terror in a 30-foot radius while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the area makes a DC 15 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  or becomes <em>frightened</em>  of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s terror for the next 24 hours. After this figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.</td>
