<h1>Staff of Charming</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>While holding this magical quarterstaff you can use an action and expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: <em>charm person</em>  (1 charge), <em>command</em> (1 charge), <em>comprehend languages</em> (1 charge).</p>
<p>Once per dawn, when you are holding the staff and fail a <em>saving throw</em>  against an enchantment spell, you can instead choose to succeed. When you succeed on a saving throw against an enchantment spell (with or without the staff’s intervention) you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster (targeting only them), as if you had cast the spell.</p>
<p>The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d8+2 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, it loses its magical properties.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/staff-of-charming-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
