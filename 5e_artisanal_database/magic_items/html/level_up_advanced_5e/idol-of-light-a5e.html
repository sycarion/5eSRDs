<p>This glass idol resembles a humanoid woman with a set of iridescent butterfly wings and a crystalline crown. The idol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet at all times. It has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges each day if exposed to the light of dawn. You can expend the idol’s charges to produce the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you take radiant or necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain <em>resistance</em>  to that damage type for the next minute or until you use this property again.</li>
<li>As an action, you can expend 2 charges to make the idol shed light, as if by the __daylight_ spell, for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast __dispel magic_ , targeting an illusion or necromancy spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.</li>
<li>As a bonus action, you can expend 4 charges to cause the idol to flare with blinding light. Creatures you choose within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or be <em>blinded</em>  until the end of your next turn. Undead make the save with <em>disadvantage</em> .</li>
