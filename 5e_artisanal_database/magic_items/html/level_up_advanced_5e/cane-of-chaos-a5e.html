<p>The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> (known by some by its fairytale name, the Little Silver Stick) is a gorgeous silver scepter etched with fractals, adorned with an eight-pointed star, and imbued with the power of chaos. A cunning historian may be able to track the cane’s origins to a certain mage under a certain authoritarian regime centuries ago, who supplied it to a figure widely known for their role in the regime’s downfall. Similarly, the cane seems to be drawn to those who march to their own drumbeat, directing them on behalf of its creator to sow disruption and turmoil.</p>
<p><strong>Legends and Lore</strong> Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Cane of Chaos</em>, used by a despot in times long past. It is also known as the Little Silver Stick.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> The cane stores and is able to cast spells linked to chaos, but randomly unleashes chaotic magical effects when used.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The cane can only be destroyed by a sovereign on the day of their coronation.</p>
<p><strong>Artifact Properties</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> has 1d4 lesser artifact benefits, 1d4 lesser artifact detriments, 1d4–1 greater artifact benefits, and 1d4+1 greater artifact detriments. </p>
<p>In addition, the cane has the finesse property and can be used as a double weapon which you become proficient with when you attune to it. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls and damage rolls made using the <em>Cane of Chaos</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>Magic</strong></h2>
<p>While you use this quarterstaff as a spell focus, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC. You know and have prepared all spells of the chaos school of magic (but not their rare versions). </p>
<p>The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> begins with a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus and regains 1d6 charges each dawn (to a maximum number of charges equal to your level + 1, or your CR + 1). You can expend any number of charges from the cane to cast a chaos spell, which costs a number of charges equal to the spell’s level. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).</p>
<p>When you expend charges from the <em>Cane of Chaos</em>, it unleashes another chaotic magical effect, either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined.</p>

<h2>Destroying the Cane</h2>
<p>The <em>Cane of Chaos</em> is born from the very essence of rebellion. To destroy it, you must offer the artifact as a gift to a sovereign on the day of their coronation or to a magical being with the Lawful alignment trait on the anniversary of their advent. If accepted as such a gift, the <em>Cane of Chaos</em> melts into a puddle of ordinary molten silver.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/cane-of-chaos-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
