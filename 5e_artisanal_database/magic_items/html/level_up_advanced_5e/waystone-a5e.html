<p>This rounded oval stone has a metallic gray luster. When one or more <em>waystones</em> are kept in contact for an hour or longer, they become paired and magnetically attracted to each other for 1 week per hour spent in contact. Paired <em>waystones</em> are ideal for use as trail markers, for tracking purposes, or to prevent yourself from becoming lost. You can use an action to speak its command word, making the <em>waystone</em> sense and be drawn toward the nearest <em>waystone</em> within 5 miles, or if it is paired to another <em>waystone</em> within range, the paired <em>waystone</em>. Paired waystones are only able to sense each other.</p>
<p>A <em>waystone</em> has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You may expend 1 charge when speaking its command word to increase the <em>waystone’s</em> range to 25 miles, or if the <em>waystone</em> is paired, to sense the nearest unpaired <em>waystone</em> within 5 miles. When used in either manner, the <em>waystone’s</em> attraction lasts until the next dawn. If you expend the last charge, the <em>waystone</em> becomes a mundane item.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/waystone-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
