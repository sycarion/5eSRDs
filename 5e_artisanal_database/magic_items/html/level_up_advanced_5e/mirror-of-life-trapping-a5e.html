<h1>Mirror of Life Trapping</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This elaborate 50 pound mirror hides an extradimensional prison beneath its smooth, silvery surface. </p>
<p>You can use an action to activate or deactivate the mirror by speaking its command word while within 5 feet. While active, when a creature other than you sees its reflection in the mirror while within 30 feet, it makes a DC 15 Charisma <em>saving throw</em> . Creatures that are aware of the mirror’s nature have <em>advantage</em> , and constructs automatically succeed. On a failure, the creature and all its possessions are trapped inside one of the mirror’s 12 extradimensional cells.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each extradimensional cell is an infinite plane filled with thick fog. Creatures trapped within do not need to eat, drink, or sleep, nor do they age.</li>
<li>Creatures can escape via planar travel, but are otherwise trapped until freed.</li>
<li>If a creature is trapped but the mirror’s cells are already full, a randomly determined trapped creature is freed so the new creature may be trapped.</li>
<li>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to call forth a trapped creature. The creature appears in the surface of the mirror, allowing you and the creature to communicate normally.</li>
<li>A trapped creature can be freed by using an action to speak a different command word. The creature appears in an unoccupied space near the mirror and facing away from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the mirror (AC 11, 10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage) is reduced to 0 hit points it shatters, freeing all trapped creatures. The creatures appear in unoccupied spaces nearby.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/mirror-of-life-trapping-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
