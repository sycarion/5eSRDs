<p>Composed of fire that has been kindled for five centuries since the death of Srasama, this weapon is pledged to defeat the infernal tieflings. You gain a +2 magical bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  made with this longsword. While wielding this longsword, you have <em>resistance</em>  to fire. On a successful hit against a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, this weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage. In addition, you can use an action to reshape this weapon into any other melee weapon that does not have the heavy property.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/vekeshi-blade-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
