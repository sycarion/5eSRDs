<h1>Candle of Invocation</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This golden candle is infused with raw divine magic. When attuned to by a cleric or druid, it takes on a color appropriate to the cleric’s deity. </p>
<p>You can use an action to light the candle and activate its magic. The candle can burn for a total of 4 hours in 1 minute increments before being used up. </p>
<p>While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within the area who worships the same deity as the attuned creature (or at the Narrator’s discretion, an allied deity) has <em>advantage</em>  on <em>attack rolls</em> , <em>saving throws</em> , and ability checks. If one of the creatures gaining the prior benefit is also a cleric, druid, or herald, they can cast 1st-level spells from one of those classes at that spell level without expending spell slots.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one of these candles that has not yet been lit can be used to cast the __gate_ spell. Doing so consumes the candle.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/candle-of-invocation-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
