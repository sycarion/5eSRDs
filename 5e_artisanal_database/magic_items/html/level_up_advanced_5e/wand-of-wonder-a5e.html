<h1>Wand of Wonder</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wand</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and choose a creature, object, or point in space within 120 feet. Roll d100 on the Wand of Wonder table to determine the effect.</p>
<p>Spells cast from the wand have a spell save DC of 15 and a range of 120 feet. Area effects are centered on and include the target. If an effect might target multiple creatures, the Narrator randomly determines which ones are affected.</p>
<p>This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand violently shakes and sparks with magic then disappears.</p>
