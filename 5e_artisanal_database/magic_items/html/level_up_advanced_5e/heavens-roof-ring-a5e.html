<p>Awarded to those who have performed some great service to the cloud elves, this silver band of this ring is set with a flat gray stone etched with a wing. Once a day, you can spend an action to gain fly speed of 50 feet for 10 minutes, and once per day, as a reaction, you can cast <em>feather fall</em>  on yourself. While attuned, you are also fully acclimated to great heights and automatically succeed on checks against the effects of the <em>Elsenian Span</em>.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/heavens-roof-ring-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
