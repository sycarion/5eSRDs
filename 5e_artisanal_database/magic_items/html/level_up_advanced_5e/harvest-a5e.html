<p>This seems like nothing more than a simple tool at first, rough at the handle and rusted at the edges, but the sickle’s impossibly sharp and shining crescent blade reveals its true nature.</p>
<p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sickle. It has the following additional properties. </p>
<p><em><strong>Red Reaping.</strong></em> Whenever you use <em>Harvest</em> to reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs that creature’s soul and stores it within. <em>Harvest</em> cannot store more than one soul in this way and the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit points while a creature’s soul is already contained within it are not affected by this property.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sow the Reaped.</strong></em> You can use an action to strike the ground with the sickle and produce a blood clone using a creature’s soul stored within <em>Harvest.</em> This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones formed in this way act immediately after you in initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to the best of their ability. Without such commands, the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed, a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10 minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever afterlife was intended for it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Only Life May Die.</strong> Harvest</em> has no effect on unliving creatures, and passes harmlessly through constructs and undead when it is used to attack them. </p>
<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong> Harvest</em> is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17. It sees and hears using your senses. <em>Harvest</em> communicates with only you telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is not attuned to.</p>
<p><em><strong>Personality.</strong></em> This sickle originally had a much more benign purpose, created by a halfling archdruid to bring forth a new plant for each one harvested. When its creator was killed by an orcish warchief it became a weapon, and in her hands it grew to find a new purpose. It eventually convinced its bearer to sow what she reaped, and caused the very spirit and blood of those she had cut down to slaughter its orcish captors. <em>Harvest</em> has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. <em>Harvest</em> tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its “culling”. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth’s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using Harvest to slay a sentient creature, you’ll be in conflict with <em>Harvest</em>. When in conflict, any time you use the Sow the Reaped property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into <em>Harvest</em>. </p>
<p><em><strong>Destroying Harvest.</strong></em> <em>Harvest</em> is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering <em>Harvest</em> an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/harvest-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
