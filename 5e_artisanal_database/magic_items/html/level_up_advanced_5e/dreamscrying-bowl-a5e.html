<p>This terra cotta pottery bowl has a glossy black band around the rim and is sized to be used as a nightstand washbowl. Most of it is covered in geometric shapes unique to each other. When you are attuned to the bowl and fill it with holy water, the reflection on its surface portrays your most recent dream, or the dream of a sleeping creature within your reach. If the water is disturbed the shown dream disappears and will not return. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can shatter the bowl and choose one sleeping creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the sleeping creature awakens naturally, its dream and sleep cannot be interrupted or effected by any other magic.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/dreamscrying-bowl-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
