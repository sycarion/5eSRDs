<p>While you are attuned to and wearing this necklace of serrated teeth, you gain a bite natural weapon attack that deals 1d6 magical piercing damage, and you cannot become <em>diseased</em>  or <em>poisoned</em>  from anything you eat or drink.</p>
<p>In addition, you may eat anything organic that can reasonably fit in your mouth without difficulty (or regard for taste) and gain sustenance from doing so as if you have consumed a normal meal. </p>
<p><strong>Curse.</strong> Your appearance and aura carries a hint of malice and despair. You have <em>disadvantage</em>  on Charisma checks and beasts are hostile towards you.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/necklace-of-hunger-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
