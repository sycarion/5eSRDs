<p>None living know who or what Dal was, only that the name is carved into this device. About half a foot in diameter, this flat disk resembles a sundial with many styles (time-telling edges), each of which can be moved on its own course, rotating on the flat of the disc on an undetectable groove. As these are moved, you receive a vision of events and emotions that have occurred in your current location.</p>
<p>As an action, you can use the dial of Dal to cast the __legend lore_  spell focused on your current location without the need for material components. Once used in this way, the dial cannot be used again until you finish a <em>long rest</em> .</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/dial-of-dal-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
