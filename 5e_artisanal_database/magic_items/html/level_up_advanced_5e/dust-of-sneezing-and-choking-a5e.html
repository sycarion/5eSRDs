<p>This fine gray dust is usually found in a vial and appears to be <em>dust of disappearance</em> , even when magic is used to <em>identify</em> it. Each vial contains enough for a single use.</p>
<p>You can use an action to throw the dust into the air. You and creatures within 30 feet of you that breathe make a DC 15 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or become wracked with violent coughing and sneezing, becoming <em>incapacitated</em>  and beginning to <em>suffocate</em> . While conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on a success. A <em>lesser restoration</em>  spell also ends the effects.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/dust-of-sneezing-and-choking-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
