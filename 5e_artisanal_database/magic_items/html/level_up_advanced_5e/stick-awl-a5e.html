<p>This simple, small, pointed leatherworking tool has a sturdy maple wooden handle and a superb steel point that never dulls. Used by crafters to make the finest armor, it has been known to pierce the toughest of hides. When used as a weapon the awl is treated as a dagger that deals 1 point of magical piercing damage. When you speak the command word while making a successful melee weapon attack with it against an object, the awl is destroyed after puncturing a hole. The awl is able to puncture any substance, and the hole it leaves behind is 3-inches deep with a diameter of 1/8th-inch. Unlike other enchanted trinkets, the awl can be used as a weapon without potentially being destroyed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/stick-awl-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
