<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>

</ul>
<p>Rumored to be crafted from the sailcloth of the notorious Black Opal, this heavy black canvas has been roughly sewn with human hair into a cloak.</p>
<p>As a bonus action you can expend one charge to call on the ship’s necromantic power and gain 1d4+4 temporary hit points. The sail has 3 charges and regains 1 charge for every hour spent submerged in seawater.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points while attuned to this item, you immediately become stable as the hair burns to ash, blowing away at the faintest breeze and leaving behind a mundane piece of bone-dry sailcloth.  </p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/sail-of-the-black-opal-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
