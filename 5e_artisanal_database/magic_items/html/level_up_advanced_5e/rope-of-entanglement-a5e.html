<p>This magical rope is 60 feet long, holds up to 3,000 pounds, and weighs only 3 pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can use an action to speak a command word that animates it. With a bonus action, you can make the other end move toward a destination you choose. </p>
<p>The other end moves 10 feet on each of your turns until it reaches the point, moves its maximum length away, or you command it to halt. You may also command the rope to coil itself, knot itself, unknot itself, or fasten or unfasten itself.</p>
<p>While knotted, the rope shortens to 50 feet as knots appear at 1 foot intervals along its length. Creatures have <em>advantage</em>  on checks made to climb the rope when it is used in this way.</p>
<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. When damaged the rope recovers 1 hit point every 5 minutes. The rope is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/rope-of-entanglement-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
