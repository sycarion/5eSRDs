<h1>Crafter’s Codex</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Artifact</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>Centuries ago, a famed artificer published her masterwork treatise on crafting magic items—humbly titled <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em>—and the work was so revolutionary that every serious library simply had to have a copy. The work still influences the art of crafting magic items to this day. </p>
<p>A regular copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> is a masterwork book about crafting magic items. Yet a fabled version of this tome is said to meander through literary circles—a copy annotated by a mad genius. Known as the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em>, this copy of the book is dog-eared throughout and stuffed to the brim with exceedingly peculiar, illegible marginalia. To the person approaching the book through the right means (such as refracting the text through a beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one’s own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step instructions which streamline and improve the enchantments described within. Alas, no owner seems to hold on to the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> for long. The book itself appears to hyperfixate on a given reader and then simply disappear, presumably in search of someone more suited to its talents and disposition.</p>
<p><strong>Legends and Lore</strong> Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em>, a legendary book containing secrets of crafting magical items that can unsettle even the strongest minds.</p>
<p><strong>DC 18</strong> This book is a unique annotated version of the more common <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em>.</p>
<p><strong>DC 21</strong> The Crafter’s Codex can only be destroyed by destroying every copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> that exists in the multiverse.</p>
<p><strong>Artifact Properties</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. While attuned to this book, you gain an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the usual requirements related to crafting a magic item aside from its cost.</p>
<p>In addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented around inventing, the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em>, or keeping the book safely in your possession.</p>
<p>Once between <em>long rests</em> , while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, choose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce research time by 75%.</li>
<li>Reduce component cost by 75%.</li>
<li>Reduce crafting time by 75%.</li>
<li>Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.</li>
<li>Reduce a crafting DC by 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>After three failures on the Intelligence check, th_e Crafter’s Codex_ moves on. You retain a copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> but the magic and marginalia of the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it. Any bonuses accrued remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first). </p>
<p><strong>Seekers of the Codex</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> is coveted by collectors and ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the Crafter’s Codex surely means encountering some of the following foes.</p>

<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The secret knowledge that permeates the Crafter’s Codex cannot simply be stricken from the world with ink, blade, or fire. When the artifact faces a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> is to eliminate every last copy of <em>Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things</em> that exists in the multiverse—if even one copy remains, even on another plane of existence, the <em>Crafter’s Codex</em> persists.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/crafters-codex-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
