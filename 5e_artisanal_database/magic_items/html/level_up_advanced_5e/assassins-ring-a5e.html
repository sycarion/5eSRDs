<p>This unassuming-looking signet ring comes with sinister features. The first is a four-chambered extradimensional space, each of which can hold one dose of poison. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to press part of its filigree to deploy one of the poisons and apply it to a weapon or piece of ammunition. You have <em>advantage</em>  on checks made to conceal this action from observers. </p>
<p>In addition, you can use a bonus action to whisper a command word that makes a garrote of shadowy force unspool from the ring. A creature <em>grappled</em>  using this garrote has <em>disadvantage</em>  on <em>saving throws</em>  made to escape the grapple.</p>
<p>This ring’s magic is subtle and creatures have <em>disadvantage</em>  on checks made to notice it is magical or determine its purpose.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/assassins-ring-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
