<h1>Zlick’s Message Cushion</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Common</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This small pink air bladder has a winking wizard emblazoned on the front. As a bonus action, you can whisper a phrase up to 10 words long into the cushion, which will inflate it. While inflated, any creature that accidentally sits on or applies pressure to the cushion deflates it. A creature can also use a bonus action to intentionally deflate the cushion. When the cushion deflates, it loudly repeats the phrase spoken into it along with somewhat humorous flatulence noise. This sound is clearly audible to a range of 50 feet.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can cast a cantrip or spell of 1st-level into the <em>Zlick’s message cushion</em> so long as the words laughter, mockery, or whisper are in the spell name. When the cushion is deflated it casts the spell, targeting the creature that deflated it, and afterward it becomes a mundane item.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/zlicks-message-cushion-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
