<p>A humanoid brain floats in formaldehyde within this glass and iron jar, the electrodes protruding from its lid sparking on occasion as the mass of tissue within twitches. You can use an action to gain a flash of insight by shocking your own mind with the jar’s electrodes, taking 1d6 lightning damage. You gain 5 expertise dice to use on Intelligence checks made in the next minute, either individually or up to as many as 3 at a time. Once the jar is used in this way the sparks recede and it cannot be used in this way again for the next 24 hours. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the brain can be wired up directly to the mind of another creature. This process takes 1 minute and allows a creature to consult the jarred brain about a specific course of action (as the spell __augury_ ), after which it malfunctions and shatters.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/jarred-brain-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
