<p>This miniature private correspondence, which smells of floral perfume, is proof of a particularly scandalous dalliance between two noble fey which you can exploit for a favor. While attuned to the letter you can whisper the command word to cast either __druidcraft_  or mending. You can’t do so again until you finish a <em>long rest</em> .</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use an action to summon a Tiny faerie (AC 15, HP 1, Speed fly 30 ft., spell save DC 12). The faerie is <em>charmed</em>  by you and acts immediately, casting one of the following spells as directed: __faerie fire , healing word ,<em> or __hideous laughter ,</em> after which it acts to preserve its own life and will only take the Dodge or Hide actions. If the faerie dies in your service the letter loses its power, but you retain the proof of their misconduct. Otherwise the faerie disappears after 1 minute, taking its love letter with it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/faerie-love-letter-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
