<p>This medium armor is made from the bones of several humanoids—ribs, shoulder, femurs and many others have been bound in leather and fused with necromantic magic—and while donned it imparts a touch of undeath to the wearer. While wearing this armor, you gain resistance to poison and necrotic damage, but also vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. As a bonus action, you can make the bones rattle to gain <em>advantage</em>  on the next Intimidation check you make this turn against a humanoid. It is in all other ways similar to chain mail, except that you don’t have <em>disadvantage</em>  on Stealth checks while wearing it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/osseous-plate-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
