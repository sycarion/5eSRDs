<p>This dagger cuts through space as easily as flesh. You gain a +3 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  made with this magic weapon.</p>
<p>Weapon attacks using <em>warpblade</em> deal an extra 2d6 force damage. While you are attuned to the dagger and take the Attack action, you can choose an object or surface within 60 feet, making one of your attacks against it (AC 10). On a successful hit, warpblade is embedded into the target. While <em>warpblade</em> is embedded, you can use a reaction to instantly teleport yourself to an unoccupied space adjacent to it and remove it from the target. In addition, on your turn you can instantly return <em>warpblade</em> to your hand (no action required).</p>
<p><em>Warpblade</em> has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast the following spells: __misty step_  (1 charge), __dimension door_ (2 charges), <em>teleport</em>  (3 charges).</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/warpblade-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
