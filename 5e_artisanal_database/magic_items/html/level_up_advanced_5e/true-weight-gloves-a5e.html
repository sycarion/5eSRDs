<p>This set of emerald green gloves are made from velvet with very fine silk stitching and function as a small scale. While wearing them, you can hold two objects in your hands and know the exact weight of the objects. The objects must be of a size and weight that allow you to hold your arms straight out with one in each open palm. While using the gloves to weigh objects, you can speak a command word that makes them disappear in a puff of green smoke if either object is counterfeit.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/true-weight-gloves-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
