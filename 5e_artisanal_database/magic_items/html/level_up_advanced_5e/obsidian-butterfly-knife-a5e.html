<h1>Obsidian Butterfly Knife</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Weapon</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>

</ul>
<p>Made of razor-sharp obsidian, this finely-balanced blade glows faintly with deep purple light. </p>
<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this dagger. </p>
<p>You can use an action to cause the dagger’s inner light to brighten, glowing like the corona of an eclipsed sun. This glow lasts for 1 minute or until you use it to deal damage to a creature. That creature makes a DC 12 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or it takes 3d6 necrotic damage and is unable to regain hit points for 1 minute. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target immediately dies and 1d4 rounds later its body explodes into a swarm of obsidian butterflies that completely eviscerate the corpse, leaving only the heart behind. The dagger can’t be used this way again until it is exposed to a new sunrise.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/obsidian-butterfly-knife-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
