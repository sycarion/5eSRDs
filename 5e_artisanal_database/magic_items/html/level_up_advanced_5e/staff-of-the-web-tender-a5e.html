<p>You gain a +2 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  with this magic quarterstaff. Additionally, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to <em>spell attack rolls</em> .</p>
<p>While holding this staff, natural and magical spider webs do not hamper your movement. In addition, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast <em>animal friendship</em>  (spiders only), using your spell save DC. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can affect one additional spider for each additional charge expended.</p>
<p>You can use an action to expend 5 charges to summon a <em>phase spider</em> , which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The spider is friendly to you and your companions and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. Without such commands, the spider only defends itself. The spider disappears when reduced to 0 hit points or 1 hour after you summoned it.</p>
<p>The staff has 8 charges and regains 1d6+2 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff transforms into hundreds of harmless Tiny spiders that wander away.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/staff-of-the-web-tender-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
