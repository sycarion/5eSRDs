<p>This suit of terrifying   <em>2 full plate</em> is engraved with Infernal runes that blaze with unholy power. You cannot attune to this armor if you have the Good alignment trait. While attuned to and wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your AC increases by 2.</li>
<li>You count as one size category larger when determining your carrying capacity.</li>
<li>Your Strength score increases to 20. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.</li>
<li>You have <em>advantage</em>  on Strength checks and <em>saving throws</em> .</li>
<li>You can use a bonus action and choose a creature that can see you, forcing it to make a Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become <em>frightened</em>  for 1 minute. Once you have used this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</li>
<li>Your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.</li>
<li>Celestials, elementals, fey, and creatures with the Good alignment trait have <em>disadvantage</em>  on <em>attack rolls</em>  made against you.</li>
