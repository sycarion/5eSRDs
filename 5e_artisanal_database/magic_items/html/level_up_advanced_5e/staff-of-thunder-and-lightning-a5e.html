<p>You gain a +2 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  with this magic quarterstaff. Additionally, while holding it you can activate one of the following properties, each of which can be used once per dawn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning.</em></strong> When you make a successful melee attack with the staff, you deal an extra 2d6 lightning damage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thunder.</strong></em> When you make a successful melee attack with the staff, you cause it to emit a thunderclap audible up to 300 feet away. The target makes a DC 17 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or it is <em>stunned</em>  until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><em><strong>Lightning Strike.</strong></em> You can use an action to fire a 120 feet long and 5 foot wide line of lightning from the staff. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em> , taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thunderclap.</strong></em> You can use an action to create a thunderous roar audible up to 600 feet away. Each creature other than you within 60 feet makes a DC 17 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes <em>deafened</em>  for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thunder and Lightning</strong>.</em> You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties simultaneously. This doesn’t expend the daily uses of those properties, only this one.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/staff-of-thunder-and-lightning-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
