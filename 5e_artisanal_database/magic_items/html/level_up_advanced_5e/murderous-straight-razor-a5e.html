<h1>Murderous Straight Razor</h1>
<ul>

<p>This otherwise gleaming implement has dark stains that cannot be polished or scrubbed off. You gain a +2 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  made with this razor. A number of times per day equal to half your proficiency bonus, when you hit with a melee attack you can use a bonus action to channel the inherent hatred of the razor, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage.</p>
<p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> Once attuned to this weapon, you are <em>cursed</em>  until you are targeted by <em>remove curse</em> or similar magic. Your appearance and manner have a hint of murderous rage at all times, giving you <em>disadvantage</em>  on Charisma checks and making beasts hostile towards you. Additionally, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with any other weapon and must make a DC 14 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  to willingly part with the razor, even temporarily.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/murderous-straight-razor-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
