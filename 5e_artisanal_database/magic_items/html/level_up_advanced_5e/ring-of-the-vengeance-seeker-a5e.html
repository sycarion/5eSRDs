<p>This silver ring is set with an exquisite emerald. As an action, you can rotate the ring three times on your finger, casting the __poison skin_  spell. When cast in this way, the effect of the bright colors gives the appearance of brilliantly-colored makeup, face paint, or hair dye, removing the <em>disadvantage</em>  to Stealth. Recognizing the coloring for what it is requires a DC 14 Arcana check. Once the ring has been used in this way, it cannot be used until the next evening.</p>
<p>You can also use an action to release the gem from its setting and drop it into a container of liquid no larger than a mug of ale. The liquid functions as a truth serum. Once the gem is removed, the ring becomes a mundane item.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/ring-of-the-vengeance-seeker-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
