<h1>Culdarath the Ninth Ring’s True Name</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Common</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name “Ozzacath’ta Culd” and is burned black at the edges. While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this parchment to summon a vision of a powerful efreet beside you for 1 minute. Ozzacath is haughty and impatient when conjured but seems to relish the chance to burn anything. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Light a bonfire, candle, or similar flammable object within 15 feet.</li>
<li>Burn brightly (or cease burning brightly) for the next minute providing bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for a further 15 feet.</li>
<li>Translate up to 25 words of spoken or written Ignan into Common.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on Culdarath in exchange for his direct assistance. When you do so the parchment burns to cinders and for the next minute the vision roars into a ball of fire within 5 feet of you (as __flaming sphere_ , save DC 13). On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally indicate where the ball of fire moves. Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke Culdarath’s true name again.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/culdarath-the-ninth-rings-true-name-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
