<p>While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one willing humanoid you can see within 30 feet. For the next hour, the target gains one of the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to read, speak, and understand one language you are proficient with.</li>
<li>Proficiency with one skill or tool with which you are proficient.</li>
<li>Knowledge of some piece of information you know that you could communicate in less than 1 minute, such as the contents of a book you have read or directions to a location familiar to you. The target gains this knowledge even if you do not share a language. When the effect ends, the target forgets the information you imparted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand fades from existence and you forget you ever owned it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/wand-of-erudition-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
