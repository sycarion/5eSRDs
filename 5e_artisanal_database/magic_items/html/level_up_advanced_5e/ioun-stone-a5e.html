<p>Some say these enchanted gems take their name from a deity of knowledge, others that they are named for the sound they make as they gently orbit their bearer’s head. Whatever the case, there are many types of <em>ioun stones</em>, each imbued with powerful beneficial magic.</p>
<p>The specifics of these stones vary but they all work in essentially the same way: once you have attuned to it you can use an action to set a stone in a gentle orbit around your head, 1d4 feet away from you. Another creature may use an action to try and take an orbiting stone, but must make a melee attack against AC 24 or make a DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. An <em>ioun stone’s</em> AC is 24, it has 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. While orbiting your head, it is considered a worn item. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive state.</p>

If there aren’t enough available levels to hold a spell, it cannot be stored. While the stone is orbiting you, you can cast any spell stored in it using the appropriate action. The spell uses the spell level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the creature that stored the spell, but you are considered to be the caster.
