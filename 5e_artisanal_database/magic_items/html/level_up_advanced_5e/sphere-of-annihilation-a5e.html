<h1>Sphere of Annihilation</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Legendary</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This floating sphere of darkness is a 2-foot-diameter hole in reality that eliminates all matter that it comes into contact with. Only artifacts can survive contact with the sphere, though some artifacts have a specific weakness to its properties.</p>
<p>Anything that the sphere touches or that touches it that is not instantly obliterated takes 4d10 force damage. The default state of the sphere is stationary, but should a creature be in the way of a moving sphere it makes a DC 13 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em>  or takes 4d10 force damage.</p>
<p>While within 60 feet of an uncontrolled <em>sphere of annihilation</em>, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check and take control of it. On a success, the sphere moves in the direction of your choice a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you instead. </p>
<p>If a sphere is controlled by another creature, you may wrest away control by using an action and making an Intelligence (Arcana) check opposed by the controlling creature. On a success, you take control of the sphere and can utilize it as normal. </p>
<p>A unique effect happens when a sphere comes into contact with a planar portal or extradimensional space (such as a <em>portable hole</em> ). In the case of such an event, the Narrator rolls d100 to determine what happens next: on 1–50 the sphere is destroyed, on 51–85 the sphere simply moves through the portal or into the space, and on 86–100 a rift forms that pulls in all creatures and objects within 180 feet. Each object and creature, including the sphere, reappears in a random plane of existence. </p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/sphere-of-annihilation-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
