<h1>Orb of Dragonkind</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Artifact</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>Long ago the souls of five evil dragons were ripped from their corporeal bodies and captured with arcana by mages that sought to end the tyranny of wicked winged serpents. Each is contained within an intricately inscribed crystal globe 10 inches across—though when the magic within is called upon, an orb swells to double its size and glows with a faint light revealing the color of the scales that once belonged to what little remains of the creature that now resides in it. </p>
<p>While you are attuned to and holding a_n Orb of Dragonkind,<em> you can use an action and speak a command word to attempt to control the draconic soul within by making a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, you can control the _Orb of Dragonkind,</em> or on a failure you are charmed by it. Both effects last until you are no longer attuned to the orb.</p>
<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you cannot choose to end your attunement to it. In addition, the orb can innately cast __suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18) to compel you to commit evil acts that serve its purposes—exacting revenge, attaining its freedom, spread suffering and ruin, encourage the worship of foul draconic deities, collect the other <em>orbs of dragonkind</em>, or whatever else the Narrator deems fit. </p>
<p><strong>Legends and Lore</strong> Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:</p>
<p><strong>DC 15</strong> This is an <em>Orb of Dragonkind,</em> an artifact with the power to control dragons. </p>
<p><strong>DC 20</strong> Five orbs were made, each containing the soul of an evil dragon.</p>
<p><strong>DC 25</strong> The orb can summon evil dragons, but does not actually control them.</p>
<p><strong>Artifact Properties</strong></p>
<p>An <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.</p>
<p><strong>Magic</strong></p>
<p>While you are controlling an <em>Orb of Dragonkind,</em> you can use an action to cast detect magic at will. You can also expend 1 or more charges to cast <em>detect magic</em> (no charge), __daylight  (<em>1 charge), __death ward</em>  (2 charges), <em>cure wounds</em>  (5th-level version, 3 charges), or __scrying_ (save DC 18; 3 charges). </p>
<p><strong>The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges each dawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call Dragons</strong></p>
<p>While you are controlling an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em>, you can use an action to send a telepathic message in a 40-mile radius. Evil dragons that are mortal and in the area are compelled to take the quickest and most direct route to the orb, though they may not be friendly or pleased with being forced to answer the call. Once this property has been used, you cannot use it again for 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>Destroying an Orb</strong></p>
<p>Despite its glass appearance, an <em>Orb of Dragonkind</em> is immune to most types of damage (including draconic breath weapons and natural attacks), but they can be destroyed by the __disintegrate_ spell or a single strike from a weapon with a +3 magical bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/orb-of-dragonkind-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
