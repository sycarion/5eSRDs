<p>This plain and rough old steel flask hides one's vices most inconspicuously. Any liquid poured into the flask instantly becomes intoxicating and remains so even if poured out of the flask. The flask has no effect on any form of magical liquids poured into it.</p>
<p>The flask has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge, spraying a 10-foot cone that empties the flask of its contents. Creatures within the area make a DC 10 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or are <em>poisoned</em>  by the potent alcohol. At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned by the flask can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the flask loses its potency and becomes a mundane item.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/flask-of-inebriation-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
