<h1>Sonic Staff</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Weapon</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This metal polearm has complex flanged baffles along its haft and ends with a faintly glowing two-tined cap not unlike a tuning fork. When struck it reverberates near-deafeningly and by adjusting its components you can tune it to the destructive resonance of an object.</p>
<p>You have a +1 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  made with this magic weapon. It constantly emits a high-pitched whine that is uncomfortable to animals. Animals do not willingly approach within 10 feet of the staff without a successful DC 22 Animal Handling check. </p>
<p>Attacks with this weapon deal double damage against doors and other objects.</p>
<p>Once per day, you can use an action to slam it against the ground and generate a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot radius or 30-foot cone. Creatures in the area take 3d6 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away. This effect cannot penetrate a <em>silence</em> spell (or any similar magical silence effect).</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/sonic-staff-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
