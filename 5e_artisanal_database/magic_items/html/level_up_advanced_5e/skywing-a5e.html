<p>Folding into a specially designed backpack, a <em>skywing</em> is part mechanical, part magical, and you can gain proficiency with it as though it were a tool. The apparatus can be deployed as a bonus action and gives you a glide speed of 20 feet, but reduces your walking speed by half. Gliding allows you to move horizontally 1 foot for every 1 foot it descends, falling if you move less than 5 feet each turn. In addition, you can spend an action to make a Dexterity check. On a success, you gain 5 feet of height. The DC of this check is set by the Narrator based on the weather conditions.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/skywing-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
