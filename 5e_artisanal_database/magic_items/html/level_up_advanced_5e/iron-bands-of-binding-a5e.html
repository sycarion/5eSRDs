<p>This smooth iron sphere conceals a formidable set of restraints that unfolds into metal bands when thrown. Once between long rests you can use an action to throw it at a creature within 60 feet, treating it as if it were a ranged weapon attack with which you are proficient. On a hit, if the creature is Huge-sized or smaller it becomes <em>restrained</em>  until you use a bonus action to speak a different command word and release it.</p>
<p>A creature can try to break the bands by using an action to make a DC 20 Strength Check. On a success, the bands are broken and the <em>restrained</em>  creature is freed. On a failure, the creature cannot try again until 24 hours have passed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/iron-bands-of-binding-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
