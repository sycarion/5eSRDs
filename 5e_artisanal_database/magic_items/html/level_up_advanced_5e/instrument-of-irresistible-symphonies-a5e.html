<p>Once per week, you can use an action to speak a command word that causes this instrument to play its own beautiful music for 1 minute. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of the instrument that is able to hear the music. The creature makes a DC 13 Charisma <em>saving throw</em>  at the start of each of its turns or it is forced to dance in place for as long as the music plays. While the creature dances, it is considered <em>grappled</em> .</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/instrument-of-irresistible-symphonies-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
