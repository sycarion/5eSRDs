<h1>Portable Hole</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>While not in use, this item appears as a cloth the color of darkness. When unfolded, it opens up into a circular sheet that is 6 feet in diameter. </p>
<p>You can use an action to unfold the <em>portable hole</em> on a stable solid surface. When unfolded, the item creates a hole 10 feet deep that leads to a cylindrical extra dimensional space which cannot be used to create open passages. Closing the hole requires an action and involves you taking a hold of the edges and folding it up. No matter its contents, the hole weighs next to nothing. </p>
<p>Food or water placed in a closed <em>portable hole</em> immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities—after being in the item, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the portable hole cannot be restored to life by __revivify , raise dead_ , or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside a closed <em>portable hole</em> can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to <em>suffocate</em> .</p>
<p>Creatures inside the hole while it’s open can exit the hole by simply climbing out. A creature still within the hole can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to escape as it is being closed. On a success, the creature appears within 5 feet of the item or creature carrying it.</p>
<p>Placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside another extradimensional storage device such as a <em>bag of holding</em> or __handy haversack_  results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/portable-hole-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
