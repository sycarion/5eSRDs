<p>This large, gleaming red ruby book contains the spirit of an elven archmage named Madam Yolanda. She lived a life of adventure and riches before eventually retiring in a vast mansion with a much younger elf. Identifying the ruby causes Madam Yolanda to appear—she uses the statistics of an <em>archmage</em>  fluent in Common and Elvish, and is vain, flirtatious, and mistrustful of almost everyone’s motives. The Narrator randomly determines her attitude towards her finders using the Madam Yolanda’s Prison table.</p>
