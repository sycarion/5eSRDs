<h1>Fizzy Rocks</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Common</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper packet bearing a winking wizard’s face contains a dozen brightly colored sugary pebbles that fizz when eaten. When you consume a piece of this candy, you can use a bonus action to throw your voice to any point you can see within 60 feet, and your voice emanates directly from that point until the start of your next turn. This effect lasts for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can consume all 12 <em>fizzy rocks</em> to cast __thunderwave_ as a 2nd-level spell (dealing 2d8 thunder damage; save DC 14). You are made an additional target of the spell when casting it in this way.</p>
<p>__Fizzy Lifter_ and __Fizzy Rocks_ </p>
<p>Ideally the combination of these two confections should be left ambiguous but indescribably bad. It should be a <em>“relative of a friend of a friend died from it”</em> sort of legend and the Narrator should create any mad reactions that they feel are interesting. However, if an adventurer ignores the warning and consumes both items at once this optional effect may be used:</p>
<p>When a creature consumes both <em>fizzy lifter</em> and <em>fizzy rocks</em> within a minute of each other, the arcane chemical reaction causes the effects of both items to end and a torrent of harmless foam to rocket out of the creature’s mouth, propelling it in the opposite direction. Determine a direction randomly by rolling a d8. The creature is pushed 100 feet in that direction. This movement does not provoke <em>opportunity attacks</em> . If it impacts a creature or object along this path it stops, is knocked <em>prone</em> , and takes 23 (5d8) bludgeoning damage, dealing the same amount of damage to whatever it impacts. </p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/fizzy-rocks-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
