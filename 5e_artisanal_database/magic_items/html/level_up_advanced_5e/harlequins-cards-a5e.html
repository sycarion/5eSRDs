<p>This deck of cards has a series of cut-outs within each card. As an action, you can make a DC 12 Performance check to send the cards flying through your hands, creating the appearance that the cut-outs are moving to tell a story of your choice. If you are standing near a light source, the story is cast on a nearby wall through shadowplay.</p>
<p>On a failed check, the story’s end is unsatisfying; if you fail by 5 or more, it takes a ghastly turn, ending in murder, betrayal, or gruesome death.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/harlequins-cards-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
