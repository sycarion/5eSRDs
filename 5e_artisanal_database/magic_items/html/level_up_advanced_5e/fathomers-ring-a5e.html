<p>This ring reeks of muck dredged from the ocean floor. While you wear it, you automatically know the depth of any body of water you can see.</p>
<p>As an action, you can cause one submerged, unattended object up to Huge size to rise to the surface of the water at a rate of 500 feet per round. You don’t need to be able to see the object you affect, but you must be familiar with it or at least possess a general description of it. Once the object reaches the water’s surface, it floats there for 1 hour or until you use another action to return it to its resting place. Once you’ve used the ring in this way, it loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/fathomers-ring-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
