<p>A convincing way to cover one’s tracks is to create the appearance that an area hasn’t been disturbed in a long time. This spindly wooden wand sheds a little dust whenever you touch it. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to conjure wispy cobwebs in a 1-foot cube within 30 feet of you that you can see. The cobwebs must be anchored to two solid masses or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. The ground beneath the cobwebs is covered with a layer of dust that suggests at least a year of disuse. The cobwebs and dust last until cleared away.</p>
<p>The wand has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 charges each dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the wand disintegrates into a mass of cobwebs.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/wand-of-cobwebs-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
