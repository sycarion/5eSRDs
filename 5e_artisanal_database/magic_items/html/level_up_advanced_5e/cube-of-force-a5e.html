<h1>Cube of Force</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This inch-long cube has a recessed button with a distinct marking on each face. It starts with 36 charges and regains 1d20 of them at dawn. </p>
<p>You can use an action to press one of the buttons, expending charges as shown on the Cube of Force table. If the cube has insufficient charges, nothing happens.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the cube creates a 15-foot cube of force that is centered on you and moves with you. It lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press another button, or the cube’s charges are depleted. </p>
<p>You can change the cube’s effect by pressing a different button. Doing so expends the requisite number of charges and resets the duration.</p>
<p>If moving causes the cube to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you cannot move any closer to that object while the cube is active.</p>
<p>The cube loses charges when targeted by effects from the following spells or magic items: <em>disintegrate</em> (1d12 charges), __horn of blasting_ (1d10 charges), __passwall_  (1d6 charges), __prismatic spray_  (1d20 charges), __wall of fire_  (1d4 charges).</p>
