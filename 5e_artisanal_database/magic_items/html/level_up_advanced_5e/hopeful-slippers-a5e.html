<h1>Hopeful Slippers</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>A wish made from the innocent heart of a scullery maid created these magical shoes, upon which she danced her way into a better life. You can only attune to these shoes if you are the first creature to do so. When you attune to the shoes, they resize to perfectly fit your feet and your feet alone. During the day they take the form of simple wooden clogs, and by night the shoes transform into beautiful glass slippers that somehow hold your weight without breaking. </p>
<p>While wearing these shoes as clogs, your Wisdom score increases by 2 and you gain an expertise die on Animal Handling checks. While wearing these shoes as glass slippers, your Charisma score increases by 2 and you gain an expertise die on Performance checks. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to shatter the glass slipper against the floor, sending shards exploding outward in a 10-foot radius. Creatures and objects in the area make a DC 15 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em> , taking 8d6 magical piercing damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Afterwards the area becomes <em>difficult terrain</em> , and the remaining shoe becomes a mundane item.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/hopeful-slippers-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
