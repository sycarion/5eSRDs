<p>This longsword has 5 runes inscribed along its blade that glow and burn fiercely in times of war but with a dim, calming light in times of peace. You gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. While <em>Angurvadal</em> is drawn, its runes glow with 5 feet of dim light when not in combat. As long as the weapon is drawn and you are conscious, you cannot be surprised and have <em>advantage</em>  on initiative rolls as the runes blaze to life. On your first turn, and for the duration of the combat, the runes emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. During this time, attacks with this sword also deal an additional 2d6 fire damage.</p>
<p><em>Angurvadal</em> has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges each dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast __burning hands_  (save DC 15). For each charge spent after the first, you increase the level of the spell by 1. When all charges are expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the fire of the runes dims and <em>Angurvadal</em> can no longer gain charges. Otherwise, <em>Angurvadal</em> acts as a mundane longsword until it regains charges. Each charge is represented on the blade by a glowing rune that is extinguished when it is used.</p>
<h3>Lore</h3>
<p>Little is known of <em>Angurvadal</em> beyond the glow of its iconic runes and its often vengeful bearers, including the hero Frithiof. Despite its rather imposing title, this sword has far less of a history of tragedy associated with it than the other swords presented here.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/angurvadal-the-stream-of-anguish-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
