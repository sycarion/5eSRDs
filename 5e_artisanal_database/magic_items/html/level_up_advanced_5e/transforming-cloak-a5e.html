<p>While you are attuned to and wearing a <em>transforming cloak</em>, you gain <em>resistance</em>  to a type of damage and you can use an action to activate an elemental form that lasts for 1 hour, until you fall <em>unconscious</em> , or you use a bonus action to end it. Once you have used the cloak to take on an elemental form, you cannot use that property again until you have finished a long rest. The resistance you gain and the type of your elemental form is listed on Table: Transforming Cloaks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gnome Cloak.</strong></em> This cloak appears to be made of vibrant earthy soil, yet it leaves no dirt where it touches. You have <em>advantage</em>  on <em>saving throws</em>  to resist being pushed, pulled, knocked prone, or otherwise involuntarily moved. While your earth form is active you gain <em>resistance</em>  to damage from nonmagical weapons, tremorsense to a range of 30 feet, and a burrow speed equal to half your Speed (leaving no tunnel behind). </p>
<p><em><strong>Salamander Cloak.</strong></em> This cloak appears to be made of living flames, though it does not burn. While your fire form is active you gain <em>immunity to fire</em>  damage, your weapon attacks deal fire damage, when a creature hits you with a melee weapon attack it takes 1d6 fire damage, you can fit through spaces at least an inch wide without squeezing, and you gain a climb speed equal to your Speed.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sylph Cloak.</strong></em> This cloak looks like iridescent dragonfly wings that appear to flutter when seen out of the corner of the eye. While your air form is active you gain a fly speed of 30 feet (hover), you do not need to breathe, you do not provoke <em>opportunity attacks</em> , and you can pass through spaces at least half an inch wide without squeezing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undine Cloak.</em></strong> This fine blue and green cloak always appears to be wet, yet it never drips. While your water form is active you gain <em>resistance</em>  to fire damage, a swim speed of 60 feet, the ability to breathe water, and you can pass through space at least half an inch wide without squeezing.</p>
