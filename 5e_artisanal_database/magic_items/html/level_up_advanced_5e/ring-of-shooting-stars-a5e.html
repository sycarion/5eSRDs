<h1>Ring of Shooting Stars</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Ring</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>While wearing this ring, if you are in <em>dim light or darkness</em>  you can use an action to cast <em>dancing lights</em> or <em>light</em>. The ring has 6 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Faerie Fire.</strong> You can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast <em>faerie fire .</em></p>
<p><strong>Ball Lightning</strong>. You can use an action and expend 2 charges to create up to four 3-foot-diameter lightning spheres. The number of spheres created determines each sphere’s intensity (see Table: Ball Lightning), each sheds light in a 30-foot radius, and they remain up to 1 minute as long as you <em>concentrate</em>  (as if concentrating on a spell). As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no further than 120 feet from you.</p>
<p>When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and then disappears. The creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em>  or takes lightning damage based on the sphere’s intensity.</p>
<p>Shooting Stars. You can use an action to expend 1 to 3 charges. For each expended charge, you shoot a glittering mote of light at a point you can see within 60 feet where it explodes in a 15-foot-cube of sparks. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em> , taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.</p>
