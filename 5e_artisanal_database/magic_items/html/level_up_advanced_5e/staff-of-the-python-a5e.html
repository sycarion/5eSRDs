<h1>Staff of the Python</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use an action to speak this staff’s command word and throw it at a point on the ground within 10 feet to transform it into a <em>giant constrictor snake</em> <strong>.</strong> During your turn, while you aren’t incapacitated and remain within 60 feet of it, you can mentally command the snake. The snake acts immediately after you. You decide its moves and actions, or you can issue a general command such as to guard a location.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can transform the snake back into a staff by repeating the command word. The staff appears in the space formerly occupied by the snake. If the snake has at least 1 hit point when it becomes a staff, it regains all its hit points.</p>
<p>If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, reverting to staff form before shattering into pieces.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/staff-of-the-python-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
