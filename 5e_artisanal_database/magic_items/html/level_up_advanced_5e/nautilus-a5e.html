<h1>Nautilus</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Artifact</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>

<p>This vessel at first appears to be a Gargantuan sea monster 230 feet long by 30 feet in height and width, its body covered in hard reflective scales. Along the top there is a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 23 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch revealing a cylinder wide enough for a Medium creature to crawl inside. The <em>Nautilus</em> is a Gargantuan object with the following statistics:</p>
<p><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 25<br />
<strong>Hit Points:</strong> 400 (damage threshold 20)<br />
<strong>Speed</strong> swim 200 ft. (can turn a maximum of 15 degrees in a round)<br />
<strong>Damage Immunities</strong> poison, psychic<br />
<strong>Crew Capacity</strong> 25; <strong>Passenger Capacity</strong> 600<br />
<strong>Travel Pace</strong> 58 miles per hour (460 miles per day)</p>
<p>To be used as a vehicle, the <em>Nautilus</em> requires one pilot at the helm. While the hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.</p>
<p>The steel submarine holds enough air for 15,000 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside (at most 625 for 24 hours). There are 2 decks of interior compartments, most of which are 6 feet high. Interior doors are airtight, have AC 20 and 50 hit points, and can be bypassed with DC 18 Dexterity (thieves’ tools) checks or DC 25 Strength checks.</p>
<p>The <em>Nautilus</em> floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 9,000 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>
<p>A creature at the helm can use an action to pilot the <em>Nautilus</em> by making a DC 18 Intelligence (vehicle [water]) check, with disadvantage if there are no other creatures controlling the ballasts, hydraulics, and sensors (each an action), or with <em>advantage</em>  if each position has a creature helping. On a success, the pilot can double the effects of any acceleration, deceleration, or turning they make with the <em>Nautilus</em> on their turn. In addition, the pilot can send the submarine careening into a creature or object, making an attack roll as usual.</p>
<p><em><strong>Prow.</strong> Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 34 (8d6+6) piercing damage. On a natural 1, the Nautilus takes 34 (8d6+6) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p>Any creature in the command room can pull a lever to activate its function, but the <em>Nautilus</em> only responds to the first 8 levers pulled in a round, and a lever only performs a function once per round. While traveling forward the lever to travel backwards does not function, and while traveling backward the level to travel forwards does not function. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position.</p>
