<p>This dessicated head of a fiend mumbles occasionally as if trying to speak but cannot, its eyes and mouth sewn shut with a rough black cord. The head longs to escape this prison and return to Hell, shaking violently and cursing whenever it is within 60 feet of an active portal. </p>
<p>Alternatively, as an action you can direct the head at a visible creature within 60 feet and cut the cord tying the imp’s lips, causing it to burst into flames and making the spirit inside lash out. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em> , taking 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/preserved-imps-head-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
