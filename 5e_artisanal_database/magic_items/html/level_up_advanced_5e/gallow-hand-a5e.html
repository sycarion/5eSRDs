<p>This grisly trophy is the hand of a person hung at the gallows, dipped in wax rendered from their own fat and wicked with their own hair. The fingers of this strange and complicated remnant of a malcontent can be lit just like a normal candle to shed <em>bright light</em>  in a 5-foot radius and dim light for a further 10 feet. The light shed by a <em>gallow hand</em> is only visible to its holder and is completely <em>invisible</em>  to all other creatures.</p>
<p>Alternatively, all five fingers of the hand can be lit as an action. If the hand is lit in this way, it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for a further 20 feet. This light is <em>invisible</em>  to the holder but visible to all other creatures. Any creature other than the holder that enters this area of light for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 13 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  or become <em>charmed</em> . While charmed, a creature’s Speeds are reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. Once lit in this way the <em>gallow hand</em> burns for 1 minute, after which it deteriorates into a molten nub.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/gallow-hand-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
