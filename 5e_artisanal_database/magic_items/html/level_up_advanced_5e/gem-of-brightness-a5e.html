<h1>Gem of Brightness</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first command word can be used as a bonus action to cause the gem to shed <em>bright light</em>  in a 30-foot radius and <em>dim light</em>  for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend any charges and lasts until you repeat the first command word or use one of the other two.</li>
<li>The second command word requires an action and expends 1 charge, causing the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet. The creature makes a DC 15 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or becomes <em>blinded</em>  for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li>The third command word requires an action and expends 5 charges, causing the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution <em>saving throw</em>  or becomes <em>blinded</em>  for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
</ul>
<p>When all of the gem’s charges are expended it loses all magical properties, becoming a mundane jewel worth 50 gold.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/gem-of-brightness-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
