<p>This quilted-patterned mug is perfect for cold winter nights or when caffeinated beverages are a morning necessity. Any liquid poured into the mug is instantly warmed to a piping hot temperature, remaining hot even when poured out. The mug has no effect on any form of magical liquids poured into it.</p>
<p>The mug has 3 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 charge, splashing the contents of the mug into a 5-foot square in a conflagration of flame. Creatures and objects in the area make a DC 10 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em> , taking 1d4 fire damage on a failure. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the mug loses its warming properties and becomes a mundane item.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/mug-of-warming-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
