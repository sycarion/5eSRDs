<p>This scrapbook contains the legacy of campaigns undertaken by adventurers in days past. When in need of advice, you can open the leather-bound tome and spend 1 minute looking for a similar situation. Roll a d10 and on a 7 or higher, you learn one fact relevant to the situation. On a failure, you instead learn one fact or piece of advice that is irrelevant to the situation (such as “<em>a group of tigers is called an ambush</em>,” or “<em>you should eat more leafy greens</em>”). Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a <em>long rest</em> .</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to rapidly find one tale of questing relevant to your situation and rip it out of the book. Choose one 1st-level spell that has a casting time of 1 action from any class spell list. Before the end of your next turn, you can cast this spell without the need for material components. After a page is torn from the tome in this way, it becomes a mundane scrapbook.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/family-scrapbook-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
