<p>This beautifully-filigreed bell can turn into a mundane bicycle of Small or Medium size (chosen at the time of creation) when you activate it as an action. Returning the bicycle to bell form also requires an action.</p>
<p>While riding this bicycle, you can ring its bell to gain a flying speed of 50 feet and the ability to hover. You can use the bike to fly for 2 hours, expending at least 10 minutes worth of time with each use. If you are flying when the time runs out, you fall at a rate of 60 feet and take no damage from landing. The bell regains 1 hour of flying time for every 12 hours it is not in use, regardless of which form it is in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> While far from malicious, the magic of the bell is exuberant to a fault. While you are using its flying speed it frequently rings of its own accord, giving you <em>disadvantage</em>  on Stealth checks.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/bicycle-bell-of-flight-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
