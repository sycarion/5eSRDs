<h1>That Which Spies From Infinity’s True Name</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>This slip of parchment contains the magically bound name “Holtrathamogg” surrounded by eldritch symbols that defy all translation. While you are attuned to it, you can use a bonus action to invoke the name on this parchment to summon a vision of a dark and tentacled elder evil beside you for 1 minute. Holtrathamogg is utterly alien and is disquietingly silent unless spoken to. Once a vision is summoned in this way, it cannot be summoned again for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>You can use an action to verbally direct the vision to do any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Instantly snuff out a bonfire, candle, or similar light source within 15 feet.</li>
<li>Translate up to 25 words of spoken or written Deep Speech into Common.</li>
<li>Whisper madness into the ears of a target creature within 5 feet. A creature whispered to in this way makes a DC 13 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  or becomes <em>frightened</em>  until the end of its next turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, as an action while the vision is summoned you can agree to revoke your claim on That Which Spies From Infinity in exchange for its direct assistance. When you do so the parchment melts away into nothing and for the next minute the vision transforms into an eldritch ethereal tentacle within 30 feet. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally instruct the tentacle to make a melee spell attack (+6 bonus to hit) against a target within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. Once you have revoked your claim in this way, you can never invoke That Which Spies From Infinity’s true name again.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/that-which-spies-from-infinitys-true-name-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
