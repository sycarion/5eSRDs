<p>This black iron axe is ice-cold to the touch and feels uncomfortable to hold. Its head has an iridescent blue tint to it, and frost gathers around it when it’s left to rest.</p>
<p>You have a +1 bonus to <em>attack and damage rolls</em>  with this weapon, and when you hit a creature that’s <em>frightened</em>  of you (as per the condition) with it, it deals an extra 2d6 cold damage. Additionally, you have <em>advantage</em>  on Intimidation checks while holding it, and when you score a critical hit with it, the target must make a DC 15 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em>  or be frightened of you for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> While attuned to this axe, a deep-seated fear comes to the fore. You develop a <em>phobia</em> based on a pre-existing fear (work with the Narrator to determine something suitable), however dormant, with the following alterations: when confronted with this object of this phobia, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom <em>saving throw</em> , becoming <em>frightened</em>  of it for 1 minute on a failure. On a success, you can’t be frightened by that phobia again for 1 hour. This does not affect a phobia gained in any other way.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/axe-of-chilling-fear-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
