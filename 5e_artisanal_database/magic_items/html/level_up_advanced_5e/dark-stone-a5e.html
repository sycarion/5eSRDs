<p>Five <em>dark stones</em> are usually found together. A <em>dark stone</em> is a black, round pebble that is cold to the touch. It can be used as sling ammunition or can be thrown up to 30 feet. If it is used as sling ammunition, a target hit by the stone takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. Whether it is fired or thrown, nonmagical fires within 10 feet of the stone’s point of impact are immediately extinguished, as are any magical lights or fires created with a spell slot of 2nd-level or lower.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/level_up_advanced_5e/dark-stone-a5e.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
