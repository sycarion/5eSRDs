<h1>Staff of Power</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Staff</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Level Up Advanced 5e</li>
</ul>
<p>You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. When you hit with a melee attack using this staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target. Additionally, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to AC, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: <em>magic missile</em>  (1 charge), __ray of enfeeblement_ (1 charge), __levitate_  (2 charges), __hold monster_ (5 charges), __lightning bolt_  (5th-level version, 5 charges), __wall of force_  (5 charges), __cone of cold_  (5 charges), __fireball_  (5th-level version, 5 charges), <em>globe of invulnerability</em>  (6 charges).</p>
<p>The staff has 20 charges and regains 2d8+4 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff immediately regains 1d8+2 charges. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties, apart from its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>
<p><em><strong>Retributive Strike</strong>.</em> You can use an action to destroy the staff, releasing its magic in a 30-foot-radius explosion. Roll a d6. On an even result, you teleport to a random plane of existence and avoid the explosion. On an odd result, you take damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity <em>saving throw</em> . On a failed save, a creature takes damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as on the Retributive Strike table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p>
