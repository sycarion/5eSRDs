<p>This round metal shield is painted bright blue with swirling white lines across it. You gain a +2 bonus to AC while you wield this shield. This is an addition to the shield's normal AC bonus. Air Bubble. Whenever you are immersed in a body of water while holding this shield, you can use a reaction to envelop yourself in a 10-foot radius bubble of fresh air. This bubble floats in place, but you can move it up to 30 feet during your turn. You are moved with the bubble when it moves. The air within the bubble magically replenishes itself every round and prevents foreign particles, such as poison gases and water-borne parasites, from entering the area. Other creatures can leave or enter the bubble freely, but it collapses as soon as you exit it. The exterior of the bubble is immune to damage and creatures making ranged attacks against anyone inside the bubble have disadvantage on their attack rolls. The bubble lasts for 1 minute or until you exit it. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn. Sanctuary. You can use a bonus action to cast the sanctuary spell (save DC 13) from the shield. This spell protects you from only water elementals and other creatures composed of water. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/zephyr-shield.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
