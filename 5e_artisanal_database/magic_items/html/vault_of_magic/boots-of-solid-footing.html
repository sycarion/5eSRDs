<p>A thick, rubbery sole covers the bottoms and sides of these stout leather boots. They are useful for maneuvering in cluttered alleyways, slick sewers, and the occasional patch of ice or gravel. While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action to speak the command word. If you do, nonmagical difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement when you walk across it wearing these boots. If you speak the command word again as a bonus action, you end the effect. When the boots' property has been used for a total of 1 minute, the magic ceases to function until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/boots-of-solid-footing.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
