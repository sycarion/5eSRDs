<p>While wearing this ring, your size changes to match the size of those around you. If you are a Large creature and start your turn within 100 feet of four or more Medium creatures, this ring makes you Medium. Similarly, if you are a Medium creature and start your turn within 100 feet of four or more Large creatures, this ring makes you Large. These effects work like the effects of the enlarge/reduce spell, except they persist as long as you wear the ring and satisfy the conditions.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/ring-of-giant-mingling.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
