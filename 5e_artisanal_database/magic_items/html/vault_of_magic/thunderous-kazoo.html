<h1>Thunderous Kazoo</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use an action to speak the kazoo's command word and then hum into it, which emits a thunderous blast, audible out to 1 mile, at one Large or smaller creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is pushed away from you and is deafened and frightened of you until the start of your next turn. A Small creature is pushed up to 30 feet, a Medium creature is pushed up to 20 feet, and a Large creature is pushed up to 10 feet. On a success, a creature is pushed half the distance and isn't deafened or frightened. The kazoo can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/thunderous-kazoo.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
