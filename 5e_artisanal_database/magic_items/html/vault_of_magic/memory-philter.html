<p>This swirling liquid is the collected memory of a mortal who willingly traded that memory away to the fey. When you touch the philter, you feel a flash of the emotion contained within. You can unstopper and pour out the philter as an action, unless otherwise specified. The philter's effects take place immediately, either on you or on a creature you can see within 30 feet (your choice). If the target is unwilling, it can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist the effect of the philter. A creature affected by a philter experiences the memory contained in the vial. A memory philter can be used only once, but the vial can be reused to store a new memory. Storing a new memory requires a few herbs, a 10-minute ritual, and the sacrifice of a memory. The required sacrifice is detailed in each entry below.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/memory-philter.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
