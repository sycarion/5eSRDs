<p>The deep blue pearls forming the core of these earrings come from oysters that survive being struck by lightning. While wearing these earrings, you gain the following benefits:
- You have resistance to lightning and thunder damage.
- You can understand Primordial. When it is spoken, the pearls echo the words in a language you can understand, at a whisper only you can hear.
- You can't be deafened.
- You can breathe air and water. - As an action, you can cast the sleet storm spell (save DC 15) from the earrings. The earrings can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/earrings-of-the-storm-oyster.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
