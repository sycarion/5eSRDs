<p>These prosthetic fangs can be positioned over your existing teeth or in place of missing teeth. While wearing these fangs, your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic bite. While you wear the fangs, a successful DC 9 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks conceals them from view. At the GM's discretion, you have disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) checks against creatures that notice the fangs.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/venomous-fangs.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
