<p>This potion's container holds a gritty liquid that moves and pours like water filled with fine particles of sand. When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. While in this gaseous form, your appearance is that of a vortex of spiraling sand instead of a misty cloud. In addition, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while in a sandy environment, and, while motionless in a sandy environment, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary swirl of sand.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/potion-of-sand-form.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
