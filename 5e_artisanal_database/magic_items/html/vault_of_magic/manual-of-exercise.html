<p>This book contains exercises and techniques to better perform a specific physical task, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 24 hours over a period of 3 days or fewer studying the tome and practicing its instructions, you gain proficiency in the Strength or Dexterity-based skill (such as Athletics or Stealth) associated with the book. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in ten years.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/manual-of-exercise.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
