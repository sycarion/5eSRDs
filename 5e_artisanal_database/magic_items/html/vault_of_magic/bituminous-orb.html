<h1>Bituminous Orb</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Very Rare</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> Yes</li>

</ul>
<p>A tarlike substance leaks continually from this orb, which radiates a cloying darkness and emanates an unnatural chill. While attuned to the orb, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. In addition, you have immunity to necrotic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal radiant damage. This orb has 6 charges and regains 1d6 daily at dawn. You can expend 1 charge as an action to lob some of the orb's viscous darkness at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the creature is blinded and takes 2d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and you can use a bonus action to move the grappled creature up to 20 feet in any direction. You can't move the creature more than 60 feet away from the orb. Alternatively, you can use an action to expend 2 charges and crush the grappled creature. The creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can end the grapple at any time (no action required). The orb's power can grapple only one creature at a time.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/bituminous-orb.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
