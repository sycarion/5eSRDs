<p>When wearing these cloth wraps, your forearms and hands swell to half again their normal size without negatively impacting your fine motor skills. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes while wearing these wraps. In addition, your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage and counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you hit a target with an unarmed strike and the target is no more than one size larger than you, you can use a bonus action to automatically grapple the target. Once this special bonus action has been used three times, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/swolbold-wraps.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
