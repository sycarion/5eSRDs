<p>These fierce yet regal war masks are made by shamans in the cold northern mountains for their chieftains. Carved from the wood of alpine trees, each mask bears the image of a different creature native to those regions. Cave Bear (Uncommon). This mask is carved in the likeness of a roaring cave bear. While wearing it, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, you can use an action to summon a cave bear (use the statistics of a brown bear) to serve you in battle. The bear is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the bear acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. It vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The mask can’t be used this way again until the next dawn. Behir (Very Rare). Carvings of stylized lightning decorate the closed, pointed snout of this blue, crocodilian mask. While wearing it, you have resistance to lightning damage. In addition, you can use an action to exhale lightning in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide Each creature in the line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This mask can’t be used this way again until the next dawn. Mammoth (Uncommon). This mask is carved in the likeness of a mammoth’s head with a short trunk curling up between the eyes. While wearing it, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can lift, drag, or push. In addition, you can use an action to trumpet like a mammoth. Choose up to six creatures within 30 feet of you and that can hear the trumpet. For 1 minute, each target is under the effect of the bane (if a hostile creature; save DC 13) or bless (if a friendly creature) spell (no concentration required). This mask can’t be used this way again until the next dawn. Winter Wolf (Rare). Carved in the likeness of a winter wolf, this white mask is cool to the touch. While wearing it, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you can use an action to exhale freezing air in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This mask can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/mask-of-the-war-chief.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
