<p>This cap is a simple, blue silk hat with a goose feather trim. While wearing this cap, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb, and the cap deflects the first ranged attack made against you each round. In addition, when a creature attacks you while within 30 feet of you, it is illuminated and sheds red-hued dim light in a 50-foot radius until the end of its next turn. Any attack roll against an illuminated creature has advantage if the attacker can see it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/grasping-cap.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
