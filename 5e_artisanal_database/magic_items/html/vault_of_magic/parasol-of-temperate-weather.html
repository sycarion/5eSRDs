<p>This fine, cloth-wrapped 2-foot-long pole unfolds into a parasol with a diameter of 3 feet, which is large enough to cover one Medium or smaller creature. While traveling under the parasol, you ignore the drawbacks of traveling in hot weather or a hot environment. Though it protects you from the sun's heat in the desert or geothermal heat in deep caverns, the parasol doesn't protect you from damage caused by super-heated environments or creatures, such as lava or an azer's Heated Body trait, or magic that deals fire damage, such as the fire bolt spell.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/parasol-of-temperate-weather.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
