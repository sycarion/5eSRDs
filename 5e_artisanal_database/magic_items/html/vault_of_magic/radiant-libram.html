<p>The gilded pages of this holy tome are bound between thin plates of moonstone crystal that emit a gentle incandescence. Aureate celestial runes adorn nearly every inch of its blessed surface. In addition, while you are attuned to the book, the spells written in it count as prepared spells and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. You don't gain additional spell slots from this feature. The following spells are written in the book: beacon of hope, bless, calm emotions, commune, cure wounds, daylight, detect evil and good, divine favor, flame strike, gentle repose, guidance, guiding bolt, heroism, lesser restoration, light, produce flame, protection from evil and good, sacred flame, sanctuary, and spare the dying. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. Once used, this property of the book can't be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/radiant-libram.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
