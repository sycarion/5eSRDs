<p>The iron scales of this armor have a green-tinged iridescence. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you have immunity to the petrified condition. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to imbue the hit with some of the armor's petrifying magic. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. The armor can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/gorgon-scale.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
