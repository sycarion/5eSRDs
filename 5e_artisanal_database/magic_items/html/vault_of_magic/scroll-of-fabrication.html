<h1>Scroll of Fabrication</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Scroll</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>You can draw a picture of any object that is Large or smaller on the face of this blank scroll. When the drawing is complete, it becomes a real, nonmagical, three-dimensional object. Thus, a drawing of a backpack becomes an actual backpack you can use to store and carry items. Any object created by the scroll can be destroyed by the dispel magic spell, by taking it into the area of an antimagic field, or by similar circumstances. Nothing created by the scroll can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you draw an object of greater value, such as a diamond, the object appears authentic, but close inspection reveals it to be made from glass, paste, bone or some other common or worthless material. The object remains for 24 hours or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. The scroll can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/scroll-of-fabrication.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
