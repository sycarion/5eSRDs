<p>This utilitarian, rectangular standing mirror measures 4 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Despite its plain appearance, the mirror allows creatures to quickly change outfits. While in front of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the mirror's command word to be clothed in an outfit stored in the mirror. The outfit you are currently wearing is stored in the mirror or falls to the floor at your feet (your choice). The mirror can hold up to 12 outfits. An outfit must be a set of clothing or armor. An outfit can include other wearable items, such as a belt with pouches, a backpack, headwear, or footwear, but it can't include weapons or other carried items unless the weapon or carried item is sheathed, stored in a backpack, pocket, or pouch, or similarly attached to the outfit. The extent of how many attachments an outfit can have before it is considered more than one outfit or it is no longer considered an outfit is at the GM's discretion. To store an outfit you are wearing in the mirror, you must spend at least 1 minute rotating slowly in front of the mirror and speak the mirror's second command word. You can use a bonus action to speak a third command word to cause the mirror to display the outfits it contains. When found, the mirror contains 1d10 + 2 outfits. If the mirror is destroyed, all outfits it contains fall in a heap at its base.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/quick-change-mirror.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
