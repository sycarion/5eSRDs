<p>When you drink this tangy, violet liquid, your mind opens to new forms of communication. For 1 hour, if you spend 1 minute listening to creatures speaking a particular language, you gain the ability to communicate in that language for the duration. This potion's magic can also apply to non-verbal languages, such as a hand signal-based or dance-based language, so long as you spend 1 minute watching it being used and have the appropriate anatomy and limbs to communicate in the language.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/cordial-of-understanding.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
