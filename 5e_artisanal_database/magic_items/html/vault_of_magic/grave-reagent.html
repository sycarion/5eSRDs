<p>This luminous green concoction creates an undead servant. If you spend 1 minute anointing the corpse of a Small or Medium humanoid, this arcane solution imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a zombie under your control (the GM has the zombie's statistics). On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to verbally command the zombie if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the zombie will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the zombie only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the zombie continues to follow it until its task is complete. The zombie is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/grave-reagent.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
