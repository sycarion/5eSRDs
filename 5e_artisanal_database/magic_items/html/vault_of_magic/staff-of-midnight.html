<p>Fashioned from a single branch of polished ebony, this sturdy staff is topped by a lustrous jet. While holding it and in dim light or darkness, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: circle of death (6 charges), darkness (2 charges), or vampiric touch (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the chill touch cantrip from the staff without using any charges. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dark powder and is destroyed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/staff-of-midnight.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
