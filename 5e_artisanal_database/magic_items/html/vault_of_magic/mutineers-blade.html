<p>This finely balanced scimitar has an elaborate brass hilt. You gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can use a bonus action to speak the scimitar's command word, causing the blade to shed bright green light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The light lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the scimitar. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target is overcome with the desire for mutiny. On the target's next turn, it must make one attack against its nearest ally, then the effect ends, whether or not the attack was successful.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/mutineers-blade.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
