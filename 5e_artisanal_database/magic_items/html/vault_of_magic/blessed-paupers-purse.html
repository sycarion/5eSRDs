<p>This worn cloth purse appears empty, even when opened, yet seems to always have enough copper pieces in it to make any purchase of urgent necessity when you dig inside. The purse produces enough copper pieces to provide for a poor lifestyle. In addition, if anyone asks you for charity, you can always open the purse to find 1 or 2 cp available to give away. These coins appear only if you truly intend to gift them to one who asks.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/blessed-paupers-purse.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
