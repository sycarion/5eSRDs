<p>You can use an action to place this 3-inch sandstone gazebo statuette on the ground and speak its command word. Over the next 5 minutes, the sandstone gazebo grows into a full-sized gazebo that remains for 8 hours or until you speak the command word that returns it to a sandstone statuette. The gazebo's posts are made of palm tree trunks, and its roof is made of palm tree fronds. The floor is level, clean, dry and made of palm fronds. The atmosphere inside the gazebo is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. You can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The gazebo's walls are opaque from the outside, appearing wooden, but they are transparent from the inside, appearing much like sheer fabric. When activated, the gazebo has an opening on the side facing you. The opening is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall and opens and closes at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action while within 10 feet of the opening. Once closed, the opening is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening. The gazebo is 20 feet in diameter and is 10 feet tall. It is made of sandstone, despite its wooden appearance, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. It has 100 hit points, immunity to nonmagical attacks excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. The gazebo contains crude furnishings: eight simple bunks and a long, low table surrounded by eight mats. Three of the wall posts bear fruit: one coconut, one date, and one fig. A small pool of clean, cool water rests at the base of a fourth wall post. The trees and the pool of water provide enough food and water for up to 10 people. Furnishings and other objects within the gazebo dissipate into smoke if removed from the gazebo. When the gazebo returns to its statuette form, any creatures inside it are expelled into unoccupied spaces nearest to the gazebo's entrance. Once used, the gazebo can't be used again until the next dusk. If reduced to 0 hit points, the gazebo can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/gazebo-of-shade-and-shelter.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
