<p>Carved from a single piece of solid crystal, this staff has numerous reflective facets that produce a strangely hypnotic effect. The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: color spray (1 charge), confound senses<em> (3 charges), confusion (4 charges), hypnotic pattern (3 charges), jeweled fissure</em> (3 charges), prismatic ray<em> (5 charges), or prismatic spray (7 charges). Spells marked with an asterisk (</em>) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. At the GM's discretion, spells from Deep Magic for 5th Edition can be replaced with other spells of similar levels and similarly related to light or confusion. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the crystal shatters, destroying the staff and dealing 2d6 piercing damage to each creature within 10 feet of it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/crystal-staff.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
