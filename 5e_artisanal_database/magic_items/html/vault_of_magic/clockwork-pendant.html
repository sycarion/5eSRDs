<p>This pendant resembles an ornate, miniature clock and has 3 charges. While holding this pendant, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the blur, haste, or slow spell (save DC 15) from it. The spell's duration changes to 3 rounds, and it doesn't require concentration. You can have only one spell active at a time. If you cast another, the previous spell effect ends. It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the pendant is destroyed (AC 14, 15 hit points) while it has 3 charges, it creates a temporal distortion for 1d4 rounds. For the duration, each creature and object that enters or starts its turn within 10 feet of the pendant has immunity to all damage, all spells, and all other physical or magical effects but is otherwise able to move and act normally. If a creature moves further than 10 feet from the pendant, these effects end for it. At the end of the duration, the pendant crumbles to dust.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/clockwork-pendant.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
