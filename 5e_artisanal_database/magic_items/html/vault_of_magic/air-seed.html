<p>This plum-sized, nearly spherical sandstone is imbued with a touch of air magic. Typically, 1d4 + 4 air seeds are found together. You can use an action to throw the seed up to 60 feet. The seed explodes on impact and is destroyed. When it explodes, the seed releases a burst of fresh, breathable air, and it disperses gas or vapor and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames within a 10-foot radius of where the seed landed. Each suffocating or choking creature within a 10-foot radius of where the seed landed gains a lung full of air, allowing the creature to hold its breath for 5 minutes. If you break the seed while underwater, each creature within a 10-foot radius of where you broke the seed gains a lung full of air, allowing the creature to hold its breath for 5 minutes.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/air-seed.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
