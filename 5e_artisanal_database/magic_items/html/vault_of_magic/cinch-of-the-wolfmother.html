<p>This belt is made of the treated and tanned intestines of a dire wolf, enchanted to imbue those who wear it with the ferocity and determination of the wolf. While wearing this belt, you can use an action to cast the druidcraft or speak with animals spell from it at will. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. If you are reduced to 0 hit points while attuned to the belt and fail two death saving throws, you die immediately as your body violently erupts in a shower of blood, and a dire wolf emerges from your entrails. You assume control of the dire wolf, and it gains additional hit points equal to half of your maximum hit points prior to death. The belt then crumbles and is destroyed. If the wolf is targeted by a remove curse spell, then you are reborn when the wolf dies, just as the wolf was born when you died. However, if the curse remains after the wolf dies, you remain dead.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/cinch-of-the-wolfmother.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
