<p>This intricately carved ivory clasp can be wrapped around or woven into braided hair 3 feet or longer. While the clasp is attached to your braided hair, you can speak its command word as a bonus action and transform your braid into a dangerous whip. If you speak the command word again, you end the effect. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip. When the clasp's property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, you can't use it to transform your braid into a whip again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/braid-whip-clasp.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
