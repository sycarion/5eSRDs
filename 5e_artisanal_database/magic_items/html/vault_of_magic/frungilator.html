<h1>Frungilator</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Uncommon</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wand</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This strangely-shaped item resembles a melted wand or a strange growth chipped from the arcane trees of elder planes. The wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dusk. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and point it at a target within 60 feet of you. The target must be a creature. When activated, the wand frunges creatures into a chaos matrix, which does…something. Roll a d10 and consult the following table to determine these unpredictable effects (none of them especially good). Most effects can be removed by dispel magic, greater restoration, or more powerful magic. | d10 | Frungilator Effect |</p>
<p>| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | Glittering sparkles fly all around. You are surrounded in sparkling light until the end of your next turn as if you were targeted by the faerie fire spell. |
| 2 | The target is encased in void crystal and immediately begins suffocating. A creature, including the target, can take its action to shatter the void crystal by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. Alternatively, the void crystal can be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 4; immunity to poison and psychic damage). |
| 3 | Crimson void fire engulfs the target. It must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 4 | The target's blood turns to ice. It must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 5 | The target rises vertically to a height of your choice, up to a maximum height of 60 feet. The target remains suspended there until the start of its next turn. When this effect ends, the target floats gently to the ground. |
| 6 | The target begins speaking in backwards fey speech for 10 minutes. While speaking this way, the target can't verbally communicate with creatures that aren't fey, and the target can't cast spells with verbal components. |
| 7 | Golden flowers bloom across the target's body. It is blinded until the end of its next turn. |
| 8 | The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it and all its equipment assumes a gaseous form until the end of its next turn. This effect otherwise works like the gaseous form spell. |
| 9 | The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become enthralled with its own feet or limbs until the end of its next turn. While enthralled, the target is incapacitated. |
| 10 | A giant ray of force springs out of the frungilator and toward the target. Each creature in a line that is 5 feet wide between you and the target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/frungilator.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
