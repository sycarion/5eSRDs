<p>A small, red sphere bobs up and down in the clear, effervescent liquid inside this bottle but disappears when the bottle is opened. When you drink this potion, your body becomes rubbery, and you are immune to falling damage for 1 hour. If you fall at least 10 feet, your body bounces back the same distance. As a reaction while falling, you can angle your fall and position your legs to redirect this distance. For example, if you fall 60 feet, you can redirect your bounce to propel you 30 feet up and 30 feet forward from the position where you landed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/potion-of-bouncing.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
