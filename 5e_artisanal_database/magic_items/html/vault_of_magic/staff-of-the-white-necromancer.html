<p>Crafted from polished bone, this strange staff is carved with numerous arcane symbols and mystical runes. The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: false life (1 charge), gentle repose (2 charges), heartstop<em> (2 charges), death ward (4 charges), raise dead (5 charges), revivify (3 charges), shared sacrifice</em> (2 charges), or speak with dead (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the bless the dead<em> or spare the dying spell from the staff without using any charges. Spells marked with an asterisk (</em>) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the bone staff crumbles to dust.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/staff-of-the-white-necromancer.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
