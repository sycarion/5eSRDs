<p>This finely crafted water pipe is made from silver and glass. Its vase is etched with arcane symbols. When you spend 1 minute using the sheeshah to smoke normal or flavored tobacco, you enter a dreamlike state and are granted a cryptic or surreal vision giving you insight into your current quest or a significant event in your near future. This effect works like the divination spell. Once used, you can't use the sheeshah in this way again until 7 days have passed or until the events hinted at in your vision have come to pass, whichever happens first.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/sheeshah-of-revelations.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
