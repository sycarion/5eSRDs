<p>This bone mace is crafted from a humanoid femur. One end is carved to resemble a ghoulish face, its mouth open wide and full of sharp fangs. The mace has 8 charges, and it recovers 1d6 + 2 charges daily at dawn. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic mace. When it hits a creature, the mace's mouth stretches gruesomely wide and bites the target, adding 3 (1d6) piercing damage to the attack. As a reaction, you can expend 1 charge to regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt. Alternatively, you can use your reaction to expend 5 charges when you hit a Medium or smaller creature and force the mace to swallow the target. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed into an extra-dimensional space within the mace. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the mace. The target can still breathe. As an action, you can force the mace to regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the mace. The mace automatically regurgitates a trapped creature at dawn when it regains charges.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/consuming-rod.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
