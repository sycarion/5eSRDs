<p>This stylized silver ring is favored by spellcasters accustomed to fighting creatures capable of shrugging off most spells. The ring has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that has only one target and the target succeeds on the saving throw, you can use a reaction and expend 1 charge from the ring to change the spell's target to a new target within the spell's range. The new target is then affected by the spell, but the new target has advantage on the saving throw. You can't move the spell more than once this way, even if the new target succeeds on the saving throw. You can't move a spell that affects an area, that has multiple targets, that requires an attack roll, or that allows the target to make a saving throw to reduce, but not prevent, the effects of the spell, such as blight or feeblemind.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/ring-of-arcane-adjustment.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
