<p>TThis scholar’s cap is covered in bright stitched runes, and the interior is rough, like bark or sharkskin. This cap has 9 charges. It regains 1d8 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC or save DC 15, whichever is higher: destructive resonance (2 charges), nether weapon (4 charges), protection from the void (1 charge), or void strike (3 charges). These spells are Void magic spells, which can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. At the GM’s discretion, these spells can be replaced with other spells of similar levels and similarly related to darkness, destruction, or the Void. Dangers of the Void. The first time you cast a spell from the cap each day, your eyes shine with a sickly green light until you finish a long rest. If you spend at least 3 charges from the cap, a trickle of blood also seeps from beneath the cap until you finish a long rest. In addition, each time you cast a spell from the cap, you must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or your Intelligence is reduced by 2 until you finish a long rest. This DC increases by 1 for each charge you spent to cast the spell. Void Calls to Void. When you cast a spell from the cap while within 1 mile of a creature that understands Void Speech, the creature immediately knows your name, location, and general appearance.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/skullcap-of-deep-wisdom.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
