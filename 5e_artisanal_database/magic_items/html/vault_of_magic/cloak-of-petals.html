While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in areas containing flowering plants. The cloak has 3 charges. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to release a shower of petals from the cloak.
