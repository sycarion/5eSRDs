<p>This heavy, gold ring is set with a round piece of carnelian, which is engraved with the symbol of an eagle perched upon a crown. While wearing the ring, you have advantage on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects. You can use an action to touch the ring to a creature—requiring a melee attack roll unless the creature is willing or incapacitated—and magically brand it with the ring’s crest. When a branded creature harms you, it takes 2d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature is immune to this property of the ring for the next 24 hours, but the brand remains until removed. You can remove the brand as an action. The remove curse spell also removes the brand. Once you brand a creature, you can’t brand another creature until the next dawn. Instruments of Law. If you are also attuned to and wearing a Justicar’s mask (see page 149), you can cast the locate creature to detect a branded creature at will from the ring. If you are also attuned to and carrying a rod of the disciplinarian (see page 83), the psychic damage from the brand increases to 3d6 and the save DC increases to 16.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/signet-of-the-magister.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
