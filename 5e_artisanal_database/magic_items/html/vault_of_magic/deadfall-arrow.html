<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic arrow. On a hit, the arrow transforms into a 10-foot-long wooden log centered on the target, destroying the arrow. The target and each creature in the log's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained under the log. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone or restrained. A restrained creature can take its action to free itself by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The log lasts for 1 minute then crumbles to dust, freeing those restrained by it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/deadfall-arrow.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
