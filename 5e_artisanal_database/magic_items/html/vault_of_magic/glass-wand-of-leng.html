<p>The tip of this twisted clear glass wand is razorsharp. It can be wielded as a magic dagger that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand weighs 4 pounds and is roughly 18 inches long. When you tap the wand, it emits a single, loud note which can be heard up to 20 feet away and does not stop sounding until you choose to silence it. This wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): arcane lock (2 charges), disguise self (1 charge), or tongues (3 charges).</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/glass-wand-of-leng.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
