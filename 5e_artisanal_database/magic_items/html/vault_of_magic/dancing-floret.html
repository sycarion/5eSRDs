<p>This 2-inch-long plant has a humanoid shape, and a large purple flower sits at the top of the plant on a short, neck-like stalk. Small, serrated thorns on its arms and legs allow it to cling to your clothing, and it most often dances along your arm or across your shoulders. While attuned to the floret, you have proficiency in the Performance skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on Charisma (Performance) checks made while dancing. The floret has 3 charges for the following other properties. The floret regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/dancing-floret.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
