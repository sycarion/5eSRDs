<p>This pungent perfume has a woodsy and slightly musky scent. As an action, you can splash or spray the contents of this vial on yourself or another creature within 5 feet of you. For 1 minute, the perfumed creature attracts nearby humanoids and beasts. Each humanoid and beast within 60 feet of the perfumed creature and that can smell the perfume must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the perfumed creature until the perfume fades or is washed off with at least 1 gallon of water. While charmed, a creature is incapacitated, and, if the creature is more than 5 feet away from the perfumed creature, it must move on its turn toward the perfumed creature by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/luring-perfume.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
