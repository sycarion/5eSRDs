<p>While wearing this steam-powered magic armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, your Strength score increases by 2, and you gain the ability to cast speak with dead as an action. As long as you remain cursed, you exude an unnatural aura, causing beasts with Intelligence 3 or less within 30 feet of you to be frightened. Once you have used the armor to cast speak with dead, you can't cast it again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/fellforged-armor.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
