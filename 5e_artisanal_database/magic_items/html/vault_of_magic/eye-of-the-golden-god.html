<p>A shining multifaceted violet gem sits at the center of this fist-sized amulet. A beautifully forged band of platinum encircles the gem and affixes it to a well-made series of interlocking platinum chain links. The violet gem is warm to the touch. While wearing this amulet, you can't be frightened and you don't suffer from exhaustion. In addition, you always know which item within 20 feet of you is the most valuable, though you don't know its actual value or if it is magical. Each time you finish a long rest while attuned to this amulet, roll a 1d10. On a 1-3, you awaken from your rest with that many valuable objects in your hand. The objects are minor, such as copper coins, at first and progressively get more valuable, such as gold coins, ivory statuettes, or gemstones, each time they appear. Each object is always small enough to fit in a single hand and is never worth more than 1,000 gp. The GM determines the type and value of each object. Once the left eye of an ornate and magical statue of a pit fiend revered by a small cult of Mammon, this exquisite purple gem was pried from the idol by an adventurer named Slick Finnigan. Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol. Due to this, and a bit of bad luck, this amulet has changed hands many times over the decades.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/eye-of-the-golden-god.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
