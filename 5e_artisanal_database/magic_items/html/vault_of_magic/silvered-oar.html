<p>This is a 6-foot-long birch wood oar with leaves and branches carved into its length. The grooves of the carvings are filled with silver, which glows softly when it is outdoors at night. You can activate the oar as an action to have it row a boat unassisted, obeying your mental commands. You can instruct it to row to a destination familiar to you, allowing you to rest while it performs its task. While rowing, it avoids contact with objects on the boat, but it can be grabbed and stopped by anyone at any time. The oar can move a total weight of 2,000 pounds at a speed of 3 miles per hour. It floats back to your hand if the weight of the craft, crew, and carried goods exceeds that weight.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/silvered-oar.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
