<p>This metal gauntlet has a steam-powered ram built into the greaves. It has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the gauntlet, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to force the ram in the gauntlets to slam a creature within 5 feet of you. The ram thrusts out from the gauntlet and makes its attack with a +5 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/clockwork-gauntlet.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
