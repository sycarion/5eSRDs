<p>Fashioned from mandrake root, this stake longs to taste the heart's blood of vampires. Make a melee attack against a vampire in range, treating the stake as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the stake attaches to a vampire's chest. At the end of the vampire's next turn, roots force their way into the vampire's heart, negating fast healing and preventing gaseous form. If the vampire is reduced to 0 hit points while the stake is attached to it, it is immobilized as if it had been staked. A creature can take its action to remove the stake by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. If it is removed from the vampire's chest, the stake is destroyed. The stake has no effect on targets other than vampires.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/living-stake.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
