<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This brightly-colored shortsword is kept in a wooden scabbard with eternally blooming flowers. The blade is made of dull green steel, and its pommel is fashioned from hard rosewood. As a bonus action, you can conjure a flowery mist which fills a 20-foot area around you with pleasant-smelling perfume. The scent dissipates after 1 minute. A creature damaged by the blade must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn. A creature can't be charmed this way more than once every 24 hours.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/blade-of-petals.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
