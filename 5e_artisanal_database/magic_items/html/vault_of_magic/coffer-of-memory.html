<h1>Coffer of Memory</h1>

<p>This small golden box resembles a jewelry box and is easily mistaken for a common trinket. When attuned to the box, its owner can fill the box with mental images of important events lasting no more than 1 minute each. Any number of memories can be stored this way. These images are similar to a slide show from the bearer's point of view. On a command from its owner, the box projects a mental image of a requested memory so that whoever is holding the box at that moment can see it. If a coffer of memory is found with memories already stored inside it, a newly-attuned owner can view a randomly-selected stored memory with a successful DC 15 Charisma check.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/coffer-of-memory.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
