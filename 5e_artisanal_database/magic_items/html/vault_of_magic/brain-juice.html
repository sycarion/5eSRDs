<p>This foul-smelling, murky, purple-gray liquid is created from the liquefied brains of spellcasting creatures, such as aboleths. Anyone consuming this repulsive mixture must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the drinker is infused with magical power and regains 1d6 + 4 expended spell slots. On a failed save, the drinker is afflicted with short-term madness for 1 day. If a creature consumes multiple doses of brain juice and fails three consecutive Intelligence saving throws, it is afflicted with long-term madness permanently and automatically fails all further saving throws brought about by drinking brain juice.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/brain-juice.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
