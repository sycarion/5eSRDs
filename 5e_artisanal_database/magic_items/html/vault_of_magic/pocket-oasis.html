<p>When you unfold and throw this 5-foot by 5-foot square of black cloth into the air as an action, it creates a portal to an oasis hidden within an extra-dimensional space. A pool of shallow, fresh water fills the center of the oasis, and bountiful fruit and nut trees grow around the pool. The fruits and nuts from the trees provide enough nourishment for up to 10 Medium creatures. The air in the oasis is pure, cool, and even a little crisp, and the environment is free from harmful effects. When creatures enter the extra-dimensional space, they are protected from effects and creatures outside the oasis as if they were in the space created by a rope trick spell, and a vine dangles from the opening in place of a rope, allowing access to the oasis. The effect lasts for 24 hours or until all the creatures leave the extra-dimensional oasis, whichever occurs first. Any creatures still inside the oasis at the end of 24 hours are harmlessly ejected. Once used, the pocket oasis can't be used again for 24 hours.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/pocket-oasis.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
