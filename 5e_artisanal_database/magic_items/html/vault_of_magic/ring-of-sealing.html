<p>This ring appears to be made of golden chain links. It has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with a melee attack while wearing this ring, you can use a bonus action and expend 1 of the ring's charges to cause mystical golden chains to spring from the ground and wrap around the creature. The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the magical chains hold the target firmly in place, and it is restrained. The target can't move or be moved by any means. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. However, if the target fails three consecutive saving throws, the chains bind the target permanently. A successful dispel magic (DC 17) cast on the chains destroys them.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/ring-of-sealing.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
