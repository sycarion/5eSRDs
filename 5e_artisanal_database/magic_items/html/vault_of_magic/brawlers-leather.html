<p>These rawhide straps have lines of crimson runes running along their length. They require 10 minutes of bathing them in salt water before carefully wrapping them around your forearms. Once fitted, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes. The straps become brittle with use. After you have dealt damage with unarmed strike attacks 10 times, the straps crumble away.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/brawlers-leather.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
