<p>Arcane glyphs decorate the spherical head of this tarnished rod, while engravings of cracked and broken skulls and bones circle its haft. When an undead creature is within 120 feet of the rod, the rod's arcane glyphs emit a soft glow. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's glyphs flare to life and the rod's magic activates. When an undead creature enters or starts its turn within 30 feet of the planted rod, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures that aren't undead until the start of its next turn. If a ghoul fails this saving throw, it also takes a –2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions. The rod's magic remains active while planted in the ground, and after it has been active for a total of 10 minutes, its magic ceases to function until the next dawn. A creature can use an action to pull the rod from the ground, ending the effect early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it was active in increments of 1 minute from the rod's total active time.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/ghoulbane-rod.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
