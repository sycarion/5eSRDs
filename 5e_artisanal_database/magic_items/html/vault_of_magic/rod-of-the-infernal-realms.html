<p>The withered, clawed hand of a demon or devil tops this iron rod. While holding this rod, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, and the save DC for your spells increases by 2. Frightful Eyes. While holding this rod, you can use a bonus action to cause your eyes to glow with infernal fire for 1 minute. While your eyes are glowing, a creature that starts its turn or enters a space within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until your eyes stop glowing. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, you can’t use this property again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/rod-of-the-infernal-realms.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
