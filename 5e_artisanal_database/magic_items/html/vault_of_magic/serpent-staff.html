<p>Fashioned from twisted ash wood, this staff 's head is carved in the likeness of a serpent preparing to strike. You have resistance to poison damage while you hold this staff. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the carved snake head twists and magically consumes the rest of the staff, destroying it. Spells. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: cloudkill (5 charges), detect poison and disease (1 charge), poisoned volley<em> (2 charges), or protection from poison (2 charges). You can also use an action to cast the poison spray spell from the staff without using any charges. Spells marked with an asterisk (</em>) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. Serpent Form. While holding the staff, you can use an action cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a serpent or snake that has a challenge rating of 2 or lower. While you are in the form of a serpent, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can remain in serpent form for up to 1 minute, and you can revert to your normal form as an action. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/serpent-staff.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
