<p>This band of tarnished silver bears no ornament or inscription, but it is icy cold to the touch. The patches of dark corrosion on the ring constantly, but subtly, move and change; though, this never occurs while anyone observes the ring. While wearing Voidwalker, you gain the benefits of a ring of free action and a ring of resistance (cold). It has the following additional properties. The ring is clever and knows that most mortals want nothing to do with the Void directly. It also knows that most of the creatures with strength enough to claim it will end up in dire straits sooner or later. It doesn't overplay its hand trying to push a master to take a plunge into the depths of the Void, but instead makes itself as indispensable as possible. It provides counsel and protection, all the while subtly pushing its master to take greater and greater risks. Once it's maneuvered its wearer into a position of desperation, generally on the brink of death, Voidwalker offers a way out. If the master accepts, it opens a gate into the Void, most likely sealing the creature's doom.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/voidwalker.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
