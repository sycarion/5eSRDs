<h1>Handy Scroll Quiver</h1>
<ul>

<li><strong>Type:</strong> Wondrous Item</li>
<li><strong>Attunement:</strong> No</li>
<li><strong>Source:</strong> Vault of Magic</li>
</ul>
<p>This belt quiver is wide enough to pass a rolled scroll through the opening. Containing an extra dimensional space, the quiver can hold up to 25 scrolls and weighs 1 pound, regardless of its contents. Placing a scroll in the quiver follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving a scroll from the quiver requires you to use an action. When you reach into the quiver for a specific scroll, that scroll is always magically on top. The quiver has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the quiver ruptures and is destroyed. If the quiver is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If a breathing creature is placed within the quiver, the creature can survive for up to 5 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the quiver inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/handy-scroll-quiver.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
