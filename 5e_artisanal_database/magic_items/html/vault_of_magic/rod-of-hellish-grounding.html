<p>This curious jade rod is tipped with a knob of crimson crystal that glows and shimmers with eldritch phosphorescence. While holding or carrying the rod, you have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. Hellish Desiccation. While holding this rod, you can use an action to fire a crimson ray at an object or creature made of metal that you can see within 60 feet of you. The ray forms a 5-foot wide line between you and the target. Each creature in that line that isn’t a construct or an undead must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures and objects made of metal are unaffected. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is desiccated. A desiccated creature is reduced to a withered corpse, but everything it is wearing and carrying is unaffected. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/rod-of-hellish-grounding.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
