<p>This unusual cloak is made of many overlapping, broad strips of thick cloth.
Crawling Cloak (Common). When you are prone, you can animate the cloak and have it pull you along the ground, allowing you to ignore the extra movement cost for crawling. You can still only move up to your normal movement rate and can’t stand up from prone unless you still have at least half your movement remaining after moving.</p>
<p>Sturdy Crawling Cloak (Uncommon). This more powerful version of the crawling cloak also allows you to use the prehensile strips of the cloak to climb, giving you a climbing speed of 20 feet. If you already have a climbing speed, the cloak increases that speed by 10 feet. When using the cloak, you can keep your hands free while climbing.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/crawling-cloak.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
