<p>This foot-long totem, crafted from the bones and skull of a Tiny woodland beast bound in thin leather strips, serves as a boon for you and your allies and as a stinging trap to those who threaten you. The totem has 10 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is expended, it can't regain charges again until a druid performs a 24-hour ritual, which involves the sacrifice of a Tiny woodland beast. You can use an action to secure the effigy on any natural organic substrate (such as dirt, mud, grass, and so on). While secured in this way, it pulses with primal energy on initiative count 20 each round, expending 1 charge. When it pulses, you and each creature friendly to you within 15 feet of the totem regains 1d6 hit points, and each creature hostile to you within 15 feet of the totem must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. It continues to pulse each round until you pick it up, it runs out of charges, or it is destroyed. The totem has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If it drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/hallowed-effigy.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
