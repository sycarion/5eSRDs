As an action, you can hold the lens to your eye, speak its command word, and expend 2 charges to cause one of the following effects: - *** Find Loved One.<strong> You know the precise location of one creature you love (platonic, familial, or romantic). This knowledge extends into other planes. - *** True Path.</strong> For 1 hour, you automatically succeed on all Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate in the wild.
