<p>This red and white flag adorned with a white anchor is made of velvet that never seems to fray in strong wings. When mounted and flown on a ship, the flag changes to the colors and symbol of the ship's captain and crew. While this flag is mounted on a ship, the captain and its allies have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. In addition, when the captain is reduced to 0 hit points while on the ship where this flag flies, each ally of the captain has advantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/captains-flag.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
