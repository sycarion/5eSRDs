<p>The scent of death and decay hangs around this grey ink. It is typically found in 1d4 pots, and each pot contains 2 doses. If you spend 1 minute using one dose of the ink to draw symbols of death on a dead creature that has been dead no longer than 10 days, you can imbue the creature with the ink's magic. The creature rises 24 hours later as a skeleton or zombie (your choice), unless the creature is restored to life or its body is destroyed. You have no control over the undead creature.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/necromantic-ink.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
