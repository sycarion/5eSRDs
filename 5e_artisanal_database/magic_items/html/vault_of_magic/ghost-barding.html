<p>This armor is blue-green and translucent. It weighs only 1 pound, and if the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, this version of the armor doesn't. The armor's base Armor Class applies only against attacks by undead creatures and doesn't provide protection against any other attacks. When a beast wears this armor, the beast gains a +1 bonus to AC against attacks by undead creatures, and it has advantage on saving throws against the spells and special abilities of undead creatures.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/ghost-barding.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
