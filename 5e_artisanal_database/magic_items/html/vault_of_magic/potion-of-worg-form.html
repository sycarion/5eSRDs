<p>Small flecks of brown hair are suspended in this clear, syrupy liquid. When you drink this potion, you transform into a worg for 1 hour. This works like the polymorph spell, but you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. While in worg form, you can speak normally, and you can cast spells that have only verbal components. This transformation doesn't give you knowledge of the Goblin or Worg languages, and you are able to speak and understand those languages only if you knew them before the transformation.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/potion-of-worg-form.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
