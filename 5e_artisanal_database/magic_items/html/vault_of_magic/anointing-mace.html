<p>Also called an anointing gada, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the ornately decorated head of the mace holds a reservoir perforated with small holes. As an action, you can fill the reservoir with a single potion or vial of liquid, such as holy water or alchemist's fire. You can press a button on the haft of the weapon as a bonus action, which opens the holes. If you hit a target with the weapon while the holes are open, the weapon deals damage as normal and the target suffers the effects of the liquid. For example,
an anointing mace filled with holy water deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage if it hits a fiend or undead. After you press the button and make an attack roll, the liquid is expended, regardless if your attack hits.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/anointing-mace.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
