<p>This silken scarf is a more powerful version of the Commoner's Veneer (see page 128). When in an area containing 12 or more humanoids, Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot you have disadvantage. You can use a bonus action to call on the power in the scarf to invoke a sense of trust in those to whom you speak. If you do so, you have advantage on the next Charisma (Persuasion) check you make against a humanoid while you are in an area containing 12 or more humanoids. In addition, while wearing the scarf, you can use modify memory on a humanoid you have successfully persuaded in the last 24 hours. The scarf can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/charlatans-veneer.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
