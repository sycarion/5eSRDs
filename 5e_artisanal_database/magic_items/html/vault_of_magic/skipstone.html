<p>This small bark-colored stone measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs 1 ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 1 skipstones are found together. You can use an action to throw the stone up to 60 feet. The stone crumbles to dust on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 5-foot radius of where the stone landed must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be thrown forward in time until the start of your next turn. Each creature disappears, during which time it can't act and is protected from all effects. At the start of your next turn, each creature reappears in the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space, and it is unaware that any time has passed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/skipstone.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
