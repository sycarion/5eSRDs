<p>This wool brocade cloak features a repeating pattern of squirrel heads and tree branches. It has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the legion of rabid squirrels spell (see Deep Magic for 5th Edition) from it. You don't need to be in a forest to cast the spell from this cloak, as the squirrels come from within the cloak. When the spell ends, the swarm vanishes back inside the cloak.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/cloak-of-squirrels.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
