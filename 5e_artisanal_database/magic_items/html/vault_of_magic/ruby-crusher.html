<p>This greatclub is made entirely of fused rubies with a grip wrapped in manticore hide A roaring fire burns behind its smooth facets. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can use a bonus action to speak this magic weapon's command word, causing it to be engulfed in flame. These flames shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While the greatclub is aflame, it deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop the weapon. When you hit a Large or larger creature with this greatclub, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away from you. If the creature strikes a solid object, such as a door or wall, during this movement, it and the object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10 feet the creature traveled before hitting the object.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/ruby-crusher.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
