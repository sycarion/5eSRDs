<p>Made of gold or silver, this spherical locket is engraved with two cresting waves facing away from each other while bound in a twisted loop. It preserves a memory to be reexperienced later. While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to speak the command word and open the locket. The open locket stores what you see and experience for up to 10 minutes. You can shut the locket at any time (no action required), stopping the memory recording. Opening the locket with the command word again overwrites the contained memory. While a memory is stored, you or another creature can touch the locket to experience the memory from the beginning. Breaking contact ends the memory early. In addition, you have advantage on any skill check related to details or knowledge of the stored memory. If you die while wearing the amulet, it preserves you. Your body is affected by the gentle repose spell until the amulet is removed or until you are restored to life. In addition, at the moment of your death, you can store any memory into the amulet. A creature touching the amulet perceives the memory stored there even after your death. Attuning to an amulet of memory removes any prior memories stored in it.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/amulet-of-memory.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
