<p>This razor-sharp blade, little more than leather straps around the base of a large tooth, still carries the power of a dragon. This weapon's properties are determined by the type of dragon that once owned this tooth. The GM chooses the dragon type or determines it randomly from the options below. When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of a type determined by the kind of dragon that once owned the tooth. In addition, you have resistance to the type of damage associated with that dragon. | d6 | Damage Type | Dragon Type |</p>
