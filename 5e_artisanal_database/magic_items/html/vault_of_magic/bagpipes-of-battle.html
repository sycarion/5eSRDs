<p>Inspire friends and strike fear in the hearts of your enemies with the drone of valor and the shrill call of martial might! You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these bagpipes. You can use an action to play them and create a fearsome and inspiring tune. Each ally within 60 feet of you that can hear the tune gains a d12 Bardic Inspiration die for 10 minutes. Each creature within 60 feet of you that can hear the tune and that is hostile to you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. A hostile creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it is within 5 feet of you or your ally. A frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, the bagpipes can't be used in this way again until the next dawn.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/bagpipes-of-battle.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
