<p>A large, orange cat's eye gem is held in the fittings of this ornate silver ring, looking as if it is grasped by scaled talons. While wearing this ring, your senses are sharpened. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and you can take the Search action as a bonus action. In addition, you are able to discern the value of any object made of precious metals or minerals or rare materials by handling it for 1 round.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/ring-of-dragons-discernment.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
