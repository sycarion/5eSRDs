<p>This plain, wooden staff has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. When you cast a spell while holding this staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges as part of the casting to increase the level of the spell. Expending 1 charge increases the spell's level by 1, expending 3 charges increases the spell's level by 2, and expending 5 charges increases the spell's level by 3. When you increase a spell's level using the staff, the spell casts as if you used a spell slot of a higher level, but you don't expend that higher-level spell slot. You can't use the magic of this staff to increase a spell to a slot level higher than the highest spell level you can cast. For example, if you are a 7th-level wizard, and you cast magic missile, expending a 2nd-level spell slot, you can expend 3 of the staff 's charges to cast the spell as a 4th-level spell, but you can't expend 5 of the staff 's charges to cast the spell as a 5th-level spell since you can't cast 5th-level spells.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/staff-of-channeling.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
