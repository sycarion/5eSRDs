<p>Most commonly used by assassins to strangle sleeping victims, this heavy, brass ball is 6 inches across and weighs approximately 15 pounds. It has the image of a coiled snake embossed around it. You can use an action to command the orb to uncoil into a brass snake approximately 6 feet long and 3 inches thick. You can direct it by telepathic command to attack any creature within your line of sight. Use the statistics for the constrictor snake, but use Armor Class 14 and increase the challenge rating to 1/2 (100 XP). The snake can stay animate for up to 5 minutes or until reduced to 0 hit points. Being reduced to 0 hit points causes the snake to revert to orb form and become inert for 1 week. If damaged but not reduced to 0 hit points, the snake has full hit points when summoned again. Once you have used the orb to become a snake, it can't be used again until the next sunset.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/brass-snake-ball.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
