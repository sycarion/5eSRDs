Yearn for the Tide. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the trident, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to force the target to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw.

A creature that can breathe underwater automatically succeeds on the saving throw. If no water is in the target’s line of sight, the target automatically succeeds on the saving throw.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/vault_of_magic/trident-of-the-yearning-tide.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
