<p>This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties: Cast Spell. You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast Charm Person, Command, or Comprehend Languages from it using your spell save DC. Reflect Enchantment.* If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell. Resist Enchantment. If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. Regaining Charges. The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.</p><p><a href="../../../licensing.html">Licensing</a> – <a href="../../md/5.2_srd_(d&d_2024)/staff-of-charming.md">Markdown Format</a></p>
