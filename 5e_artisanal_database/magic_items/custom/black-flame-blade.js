**Ignite.** A creature attuned to the Black Flame Blade can spend a bonus action to ignite the blade for one minute. While ignited, the blade inflicts 2d6 extra fire damage. This ability resets at the next dawn.

If the character ignites one of the Blackfire Braziers, the blade becomes a +2 weapon and the sword can be ignited at any time.

This ability resets at the next dawn.
