# Handy Haversack

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds regardless of its contents.

Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again.

Food or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualitiesâ€”after being in the bag, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored to life by __revivify , raise dead ,_ or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to _suffocate_ .

The bag cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky quality. 

If the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane.

Placing a _handy haversack_ inside another extradimensional storage device such as a _bag of holding_ or __portable hole_ results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.
