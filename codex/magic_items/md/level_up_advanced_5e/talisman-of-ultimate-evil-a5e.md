# Talisman of Ultimate Evil

- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This talismanâ€™s blasphemous nature harms creatures that do not have the Evil trait, dealing 6d6 necrotic damage when touched (or 8d6 necrotic damage to a creature with the Good trait). A creature carrying or holding this item takes the same damage at the end of each of its turns as long as it does so. 

A cleric or herald with the Evil trait can use this talisman as a holy symbol, which grants a +2 bonus to _spell attack rolls_  while held or worn.

In addition, the talisman has 6 charges. While wielded or worn, you can use an action to expend a charge and choose a target within 120 feet that is on the ground. If the creature has the Good trait, it makes a DC 20 Dexterity _saving throw_  or is destroyed by a flaming pit that appears beneath it. Once the pit closes no trace of it or the target remains. Once all charges are expended, the talisman melts into a puddle of ooze.
