# Horn of Blasting

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and blow it, emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the area makes a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_ . On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is _deafened_  for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take double damage.

Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20% chance of making it explode, dealing 10d6 fire damage to you and destroying it.
