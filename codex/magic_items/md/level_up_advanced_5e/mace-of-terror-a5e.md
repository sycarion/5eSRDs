# Mace of Terror

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. While you hold it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and emanate terror in a 30-foot radius. Each creature you choose within the area makes a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_  or it becomes _frightened_  of you for 1 minute, moving away from you as fast as possible on its turns (it can only use the Dash action, try to escape anything preventing it from moving, or use the Dodge action if it cannot move or attempt escape) and remaining at least 30 feet from you. The creature cannot take reactions. At the end of each of its turns, a frightened creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
