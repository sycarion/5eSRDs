# Heartbreak's Dagger

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This delicate dagger, not much larger than a hatpin, features a curling silver cross-piece and a hilt wrapped in soft red leather. You gain a +1 to _attack and damage rolls_  with this weapon. On a critical hit, the target must make a Constitution _saving throw_  versus your maneuver DC. On a failure, it begins to bleed heavily, taking an additional 2d4 damage at the start of each of its turns. It can make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This effect does not stack.
