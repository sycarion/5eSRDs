The broom can carry up to 200 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 400 pounds at a speed of 20 feet. It stops hovering if you land.

You can send the broom up to 1 mile from you by speaking its command word and naming a location you are familiar with. It can also be called back from up to a mile away with a different command word.
