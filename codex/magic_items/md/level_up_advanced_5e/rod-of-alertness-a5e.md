While holding this rod, you have _advantage_  on Perception checks and _initiative_  rolls, and as an action you can cast the following spells: __detect evil and good , detect magic , detect poison and disease ,_ see __invisibility ._

**Protective Aura**. Once per dawn, you can use an action to plant the rod in the ground and speak its command word, causing it to emit _bright light_  in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in the bright light, you and creatures friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and _saving throws_  and can sense the location of any _invisible_  hostile creature also in the bright light.

The rod stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or sooner if a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground.
