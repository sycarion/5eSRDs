A typical enchanted _crystal ball_ can be used to cast the __scrying_ spell (save DC 17) once between _short rests_  while touching it. 

Three legendary variations exist. In all cases, the legendary variants have an alignment (Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful). If you do not have an alignment trait that matches the _crystal ball’s_, after using it you take 6d6 psychic damage and gain a level of _strife_ .

**Crystal Ball of Mind Reading**. You can use an action to cast __detect thoughts_  (save DC 17) on a creature within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. This effect does not require concentration, but it ends when the _scrying_ does.

**Crystal Ball of Telepathy**. While the __scrying_ is active, you can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor, and you can use an action to cast sugges_tion_ (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of them. This effect does not require concentration, but it ends when the _scrying_ does.

**Crystal Ball of True Seeing**. In addition to the normal benefits of __scrying_ , you gain _truesight_ through the spell’s sensor out to a range of 120 feet.
