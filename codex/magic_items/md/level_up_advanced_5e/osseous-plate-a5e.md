# Osseous Plate

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This medium armor is made from the bones of several humanoids—ribs, shoulder, femurs and many others have been bound in leather and fused with necromantic magic—and while donned it imparts a touch of undeath to the wearer. While wearing this armor, you gain resistance to poison and necrotic damage, but also vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. As a bonus action, you can make the bones rattle to gain _advantage_  on the next Intimidation check you make this turn against a humanoid. It is in all other ways similar to chain mail, except that you don’t have _disadvantage_  on Stealth checks while wearing it.
