# Brighella's Guitar

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This guitar is brilliantly painted with triangles of bright color. While attuned, you gain an _expertise die_  on Performance checks made with this guitar. Additionally, once per day, you may use an action to cast __bestow curse_  as a 5th-level spell, without spending a spell slot. However, the curse is always _disadvantage_  on Dexterity _ability checks_  and _saving throws_  and each failure is followed by a slapstick sound effect.
