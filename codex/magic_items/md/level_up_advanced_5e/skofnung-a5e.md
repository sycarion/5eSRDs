This greatsword is etched with scenes of heroic battle. While you are attuned to it, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this magic sword.
* Objects hit with this sword take the maximum damage the weapon’s damage dice can deal.
* When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. The roll another d20\. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target’s limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the Narrator. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.
* After a long rest, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Hit Dice

Skofnung has 12 charges and regains 2d6 charges per week. As an action, you may expend 1 charge to summon a warrior spirit within 30 feet of you. It uses the statistics of a _champion warrior_  except they do not wear armor and possess the following additional abilities:

_**Unarmored Defense.**_ The warrior’s AC equals 10 + their Dexterity modifier + their Constitution modifier (total of 18).

_**Bloodied Frenzy.**_ While the warrior is _bloodied_ , they make all attacks with _advantage_  and all attacks against them are made with advantage.

You may also _concentrate_  for 1d4+1 rounds and expend 5 charges to summon a _berserker horde_  within 30 feet of you. Any creatures summoned by the sword obey your commands and remain for 1 hour or until they drop to 0 hit points.

### Lore

Skofnung was the blade of the legendary king Hrolf Kraki. It was renowned for its supernatural sharpness, the hardness of its steel, and for the fact it was imbued with the spirits of his 12 most faithful berserkers. It later showed up in multiple different sagas, usually as a result of some new hero plundering it from Hrolf’s tomb for one purpose or another.
