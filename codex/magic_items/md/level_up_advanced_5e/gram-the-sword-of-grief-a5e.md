### Lore

Sword of the legendary hero Sigurd Sigmundsson, it was originally won by his father Sigmund when the god Odin approached him in disguise at a wedding feast. Odin thrust the sword it into a tree and proclaimed that anyone who pulled it from the tree would receive the sword itself as a gift, and that none had ever borne a finer blade. Sigmund drew it, only for Odin to eventually break the blade after he had used it in several battles. The two halves were bequeathed to his son, Sigurd.

_Gram_ was reforged by the dwarf Regin for Sigurd in order to slay Regin’s brother, the wizard-turned-dragon, Fafnir, and reclaim a cursed treasure. Sigurd proofed the blade on Regin’s own anvil, breaking the blade again, and then again after a second forging. Finally, on the third time, it split the anvil in half with a single stroke. Sigurd later killed Fafnir by hiding in a ditch and thrusting upwards into the drake’s unprotected belly. The ditch carried away most of the dragon’s burning, poisonous blood but _Gram_, as well as Sigrud’s arm up to the shoulder, were bathed in it, and a portion of that venomous malice remains in the sword. Though Sigurd’s eventual tragic end had more to do with a cursed ring he stole from the dragon’s hoard than _Gram_, it is nevertheless known as the Sword of Grief.
