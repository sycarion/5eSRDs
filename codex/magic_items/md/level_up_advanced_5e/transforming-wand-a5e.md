# Transforming Wand

- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This wand has 13 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the __polymorph_  spell (save DC 16) from it, transforming one target humanoid into a beast. Unlike normal castings of the spell, the effect lasts for 24 hours, at which point a target can attempt a new save. After two failed saves, a polymorphed target is permanently transformed into its new form. The wand regains 2d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If the wandâ€™s last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
