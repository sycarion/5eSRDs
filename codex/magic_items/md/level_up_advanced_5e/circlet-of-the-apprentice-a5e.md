# Circlet of the Apprentice

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This simple circlet has the color of lightly rusted iron and is highlighted by a large violet gem in its center, which appears to contain a slowly-moving metallic fluid.

While attuned to this circlet, you gain a +1 bonus to all _saving throws_ . Additionally, when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can’t use this property again until the following dawn.

**Curse.** The true name of the creature who crafted this circlet is forever instilled within it, and it becomes aware of you upon attunement. If that creature forces you to make a _saving throw_ , you automatically fail, and you can’t use this circlet to succeed. You can learn the name of the creature with legend lore or similar magic. Short of powerful magic (such as __wish_ ), only the maker’s willing touch or death (yours or theirs) allows you to end your attunement to the circlet. If you willingly end your attunement after the maker’s death, the circlet loses all magical properties.
