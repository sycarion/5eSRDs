This dark wood box with nautical-themed carvings measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and always floats in water. Three command words control its functions as follows:

* The first command word turns the box into a 10-foot long boat that is 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep. It comes equipped with one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail, and can hold up to 4 Medium creatures comfortably.
* The second command word causes the box to unfold into a 24-foot long ship that is 8 feet wide and 6 feet deep. This ship has a deck, rowing seats, 5 sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. It can hold 15 Medium creatures comfortably.
* A third command word causes the folding boat to revert to its original shape, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that canâ€™t fit inside the box remain outside and any objects that can fit inside do.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.
