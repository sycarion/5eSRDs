While wearing and attuned to this robe of stimulating and lively colors, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and make the garment to emit _bright kaleidoscopic light_  for 30 feet and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light lasts until the end of your next turn. Creatures that can see you have _disadvantage_  on _attack rolls_  against you, and creatures within 30 feet that can see you when the light is emitted make a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_  or are _stunned_  until the end of your next turn.

The robe has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges at dawn.
