While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to force a creature within 60 feet to make a DC 15 Constitution _saving throw_  or become _paralyzed_  for 1 minute. The paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on success.

This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand shatters into hundreds of pieces.
