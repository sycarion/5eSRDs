You gain a +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  with this magic quarterstaff. Additionally, while holding it you can activate one of the following properties, each of which can be used once per dawn.

**_Lightning._** When you make a successful melee attack with the staff, you deal an extra 2d6 lightning damage.

_**Thunder.**_ When you make a successful melee attack with the staff, you cause it to emit a thunderclap audible up to 300 feet away. The target makes a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_  or it is _stunned_  until the end of your next turn.

_**Lightning Strike.**_ You can use an action to fire a 120 feet long and 5 foot wide line of lightning from the staff. Each creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

_**Thunderclap.**_ You can use an action to create a thunderous roar audible up to 600 feet away. Each creature other than you within 60 feet makes a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_  or takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes _deafened_  for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened.

_**Thunder and Lightning**._ You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties simultaneously. This doesn’t expend the daily uses of those properties, only this one.
