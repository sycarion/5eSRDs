- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Weapon
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Crafted with the ichor of a rust monster, this pale white mace looks and feels like bone, but has the heft of stone and consumes metal on impact. You gain +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this magical mace. However, if your Strength score is less than 16 you suffer _disadvantage_  on attack rolls made with the mace.

On a successful attack, you can use your reaction to expend a charge and attempt to consume non-magical metal armor or a shield worn by your target, in addition to your normal damage. Alternately, when an attack misses you, you can use your reaction to spend a charge to deflect the weapon and attempt to consume it. Finally, you can use your action to spend a charge and touch the mace to any unattended non-magical metal object of Medium size or smaller and consume it.

The wielder of an item you are trying to consume must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution _saving throw_ , otherwise the item is destroyed. Unattended objects are automatically destroyed. The mace has 4 charges and regains 1d4 charges each dawn.
