Composed of fire that has been kindled for five centuries since the death of Srasama, this weapon is pledged to defeat the infernal tieflings. You gain a +2 magical bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this longsword. While wielding this longsword, you have _resistance_  to fire. On a successful hit against a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, this weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage. In addition, you can use an action to reshape this weapon into any other melee weapon that does not have the heavy property.
