# Hair Fuses

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

These small wicks and glued strips powdered with gunpowder are worn in the hair, usually at the ends of long braids or in a voluminous beard. You can use an action or bonus action to light these fuses, rolling 1d12\. On a 12, the fuses all ignite at once and you take 1d6 fire damage. Otherwise they burn for 1 minute and give you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks, but _disadvantage_  on all other Charisma checks
