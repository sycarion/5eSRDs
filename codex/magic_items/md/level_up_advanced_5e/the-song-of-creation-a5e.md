- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This golden tome is a written record of the divine dance which brought the world into being. _The Song of Creation i_s eternal, meaning that it has always existed even before the words were wrought onto the page. One wonders—is the _Song of Creation_ the written word, the book, or the melody the gods sang? Somehow the _Song of Creation_ is more than this and yet they all are one. That means that in a way the _Song of Creation’s_ wielder holds the multiverse itself in their hands.

**Legends and Lore Success** on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:

**DC 15** This is the _Song of Creation_, a prayer book filled with the eternal melody which brought the world into being. 

**DC 18** The tome can break the minds of those who read it, but it can also grant access to powerful miracles.

**DC 21** The tome is completely indestructible.

**Artifact Properties**

The _Song of Creation_ has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.

**Mystical Tome**

This tome is written in a script that even the angels cannot decipher. While attuned to it, you can read it as though you are reading your first language. Reading the _Song of Creation_ reveals beautiful poetry about nature, light, and life, but structurally they do not make sense when read start-to-end. The poems cannot be perfectly translated, as each individual interprets the same poem differently. The pages cannot be counted, and various purported complete counts invariably disagree.  
When you first attune to this tome and when you read it, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom _saving throw_  or else become _stunned_  for 1 hour. If you succeed on this saving throw, you are not subject to it again for 1 week. If you consult this tome during a Wisdom or Intelligence check to recall lore, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll, and any natural d20 results of 2 through 9 count as a 10.

**Magic**

While you use this prayer book as a spell focus, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC, and you cast the spell without the need for any other material components that cost 1,000 gold or less. In addition, you know the following spells: __astral projection , demiplane , gate , maze , true resurrection ._

**Destroying the Song**

The _Song of Creation_ is made from a material that defies categorization, and it may well be indestructible. The best hope at banishing its power from the world is to return the tome directly into the hands of a god.
