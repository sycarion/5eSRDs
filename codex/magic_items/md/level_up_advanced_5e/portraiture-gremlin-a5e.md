# Portraiture Gremlin

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This Tiny ethereal white goblinoid sits within a small iron box and is surrounded by dabs of pigments. The box has a switch that when pressed strikes the gremlin on the head with a tiny hammer. Whenever the gremlin is hit by the hammer it rapidly paints whatever it sees out of the small porthole at the front of the box. The gremlin takes 1 minute to finish the picture and the result is a perfectly accurate painting, albeit miniature. The gremlin comes with enough pigments for 5 paintings and each subsequent painting requires paints worth at least 12 gold.
