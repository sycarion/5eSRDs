This boxed set of iridescent paints can be used to create inanimate objects, terrain features, doors, and even rooms with nothing but the stroke of a brush. When you touch the brush to a surface and concentrate on the image of the item you want to create, the paint flows from the brush, creating a painting. When complete, the object depicted becomes a real, three-dimensional object. 

* Small, simple objects take a single round. Larger objects, like doors or rooms, take more time. It takes 1 minute of concentration to cover 10 square feet of a surface, and 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet of a surface.
* Objects created by the pigment are real and nonmagicalâ€”a door painted on a wall can be opened into whatever lies beyond. A pit becomes a real pit (be sure and note the depth for your total area). A tree will bloom and grow.
* Objects created by the pigments are worth a maximum of 25 gold. Gemstones or fine clothing created by these pigments might look authentic, but close inspection reveals they are facsimiles made from cheaper materials.
* When found the box contains 1d4 pots of pigment.
* A pot of pigment can cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, creating a total area of 10,000 cubic feet of objects.
* Energy created by the paints, such as a burst of radiant light or a wildfire, dissipates harmlessly and does not deal any damage.
