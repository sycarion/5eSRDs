When you try to unfold this bed sheet-sized knot of spidersilk, you occasionally unearth a long-dead sparrow or a cricket that waves thanks before hopping away. Itâ€™s probably easier just to wad it up and stick it in your pocket. The interior of this ball of web is an extradimensional space equivalent to a 10-foot cube. To place things into this space you must push it into the web, so it cannot hold liquids or gasses. You can only retrieve items you know are inside, making it excellent for smuggling. Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside it. No matter how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.

A creature attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between _long rests_ .

Any creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world.
