# Arrow of Slaying

- **Rarity:** Very Rare

- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

A particular kind of creature is chosen when this magic arrow is created. When the _arrow of slaying_ damages a creature belonging to the chosen type, heritage, or group, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution _saving throw_ , taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one. Once the _arrow of slaying_ deals its extra damage to a creature, it loses its magical properties. 

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts meant for a crossbow, or bullets for a firearm or sling.
