Awarded to those who have performed some great service to the cloud elves, this silver band of this ring is set with a flat gray stone etched with a wing. Once a day, you can spend an action to gain fly speed of 50 feet for 10 minutes, and once per day, as a reaction, you can cast _feather fall_  on yourself. While attuned, you are also fully acclimated to great heights and automatically succeed on checks against the effects of the _Elsenian Span_.
