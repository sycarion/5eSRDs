# Talisman of Pure Good

- **Rarity:** Legendary
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This talismanâ€™s purity harms creatures that do not have the Good trait, dealing 6d6 radiant damage when touched (or 8d6 radiant damage to a creature with the Evil trait). A creature carrying or holding this item takes the same damage at the end of each of its turns as long as it does so.

A cleric or herald with the Good trait can use this talisman as a holy symbol, which grants a +2 bonus to _spell attack rolls_  while held or worn.

In addition, the talisman has 7 charges. While wielded or worn, you can use an action to expend a charge and choose a target within 120 feet that is on the ground. If the creature has the Evil trait, it makes a DC 20 Dexterity _saving throw_  or is destroyed by a flaming pit that appears beneath it. Once the pit closes no trace of it or the target remains. Once all charges are expended, the talisman collapses into golden specks of light.
