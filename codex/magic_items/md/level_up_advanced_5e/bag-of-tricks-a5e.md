# Bag of Tricks

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This seemingly empty cloth bag comes in several colors and has a small, fuzzy object inside. 

You can use an action to pull a fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. Upon landing, it becomes a creature determined by a roll on the Bag of Tricks table (depending on the bag’s color). 

The resulting creature is friendly to you and any companions you have. It acts on your turn, during which you can use a bonus action to give it simple commands such as “attack that creature” or “move over there”. If the creature dies or if you use the bag again, it disappears without a trace. After the first use each day, there is a 50% chance that a creature from the bag is hostile instead of friendly and obedient.

Once you have used the bag three times, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.
