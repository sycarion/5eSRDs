# Orb of the Dragon Breaker

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This iridescent glass sphere resembles a soap bubble tinted the color of the dragon scale used to create it. When used as an improvised weapon the orb breaks on impact. If the orb shatters against a creature, the creature’s immunity or resistance to a damage type associated with the dragon scale used in the orb’s creation (fire for a red dragon scale, acid for a green dragon scale, and so on) is either reduced from immunity to a damage type to resistance to the same damage type, or it loses its resistance. The orb’s effects last for 1d6+1 rounds, after which the creature’s defenses return to normal.
