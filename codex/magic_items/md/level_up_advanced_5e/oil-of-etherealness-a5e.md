This misty white solution has turned to vapor in its vial, becoming liquid again when shaken. You can spend 10 minutes applying the ephemeral substance to a Medium or smaller creature, as well as its gear. One additional vial is required for each size category above Medium. A creature covered in the oil becomes ethereal (as the __etherealness_  spell) for 1 hour.
