- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You gain a +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  with this magic quarterstaff. Additionally, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast pass without trace, or to expend charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: _animal friendship_  (1 charge), _speak with animals_  (1 charge), __barkskin_  (2 charges), _locate animals or plants_  (2 charges), __speak with plants_  (3 charges), __awaken_ (5 charges), __wall of thorns_  (6 charges).

_**Tree Form**._ As an action you can plant the staff in the earth and expend 1 charge, transforming it into a full-grown tree. The tree is 60 feet tall, has a 5-foot-wide trunk, and its highest branches fill a 20-foot radius. The tree looks ordinary but radiates faint transmutation magic if inspected with __detect magic ._ By using an action to touch the tree and speak the staffâ€™s command word, you can transform it back into a staff. Creatures in the tree fall when the staff reverts to its original form.

The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties.
