# Elemental Quiver

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

When you place one or more pieces of nonmagical ammunition into this bejeweled leather quiver, after 1 hour each is imbued with elemental power determined by the gem used in its construction. An elementally-imbued piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d4 elemental damage (see Table: Elemental Quiver). The enchantment begins to fade after the ammunition is removed from the quiver and vanishes entirely after 1 minute. Each piece of ammunition imbued with elemental power expends 1 charge from the quiver. The quiver has 20 charges and regains 1d4+2 charges each dawn.
