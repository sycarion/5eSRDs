While attuned to this stylish cap, you can cast __fly_ on yourself at will without the need for components. In addition, the cap has 2 charges. You can use an action to expend a charge to use Wild Shape as if you were a _druid_  of 10th level. While using Wild Shape, you always retain one distinctive visual characteristic no matter what beast you are transformed into. The cap regains all of its expended charges whenever you finish a _short or long rest_ .
