# Inkpot of the Thrifty Apprentice

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This appears to be nothing more than a mundane pot of ink. When you speak the command word and use a bonus action to expend 1 charge, it fills with enough high quality and particularly durable ink of the color of your choice to fill 50 pages of parchment. This ink is extremely hard to remove from any surface, including cloth or flesh, and often takes many days and washings to clean away. The ink cannot be used to inscribe spells, and when removed from the pot with anything but a quill the ink instantly dries. 

When you speak another command word and expend all 3 charges as an action, a 15-foot cone of ink erupts from the inkpot, coating anything and everything that it hits. Creatures in the area make a DC 10 Dexterity _saving throw_ . On a failure, a creature is _blinded_  until it spends an action cleaning the ink away from its eyes. 

The inkpot has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a 5 or less, the inkpot loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.
