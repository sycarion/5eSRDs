While wearing this amulet, you can use an action and name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence, making a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a success you cast the _plane shift_  spell, but on a failure you and every creature and object within a 15-foot radius are transported to a random location determined with a d100 roll. On a 1–60 you transport to a random location on the plane you named, or on a 61–100 you are transported to a randomly determined plane of existence.
