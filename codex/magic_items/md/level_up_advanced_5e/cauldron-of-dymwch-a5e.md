When you speak the command word this Medium-sized 50 pound cauldron glows red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage. You can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again. Liquid inside of the cauldron immediately comes to a roiling boil. If a creature is in the liquid, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution _saving throw_ or gain one level of _fatigue_ in addition to taking damage.
