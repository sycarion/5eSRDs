While wearing these boots, you can use a bonus action to click the heels together. You double your base Speed, and opportunity attacks made against you have _disadvantage_ . You can end the effect as a bonus action.

Once the boots have been used in this way for a total of 10 minutes (each use expends a minimum of 1 minute), they cease to function until you finish a _long rest_ .
