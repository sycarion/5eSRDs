# Angurvadal, the Stream of Anguish

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Weapon

- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This longsword has 5 runes inscribed along its blade that glow and burn fiercely in times of war but with a dim, calming light in times of peace. You gain a +2 to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. While _Angurvadal_ is drawn, its runes glow with 5 feet of dim light when not in combat. As long as the weapon is drawn and you are conscious, you cannot be surprised and have _advantage_  on initiative rolls as the runes blaze to life. On your first turn, and for the duration of the combat, the runes emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. During this time, attacks with this sword also deal an additional 2d6 fire damage.

_Angurvadal_ has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges each dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 or more charges to cast __burning hands_  (save DC 15). For each charge spent after the first, you increase the level of the spell by 1\. When all charges are expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the fire of the runes dims and _Angurvadal_ can no longer gain charges. Otherwise, _Angurvadal_ acts as a mundane longsword until it regains charges. Each charge is represented on the blade by a glowing rune that is extinguished when it is used.

### Lore

Little is known of _Angurvadal_ beyond the glow of its iconic runes and its often vengeful bearers, including the hero Frithiof. Despite its rather imposing title, this sword has far less of a history of tragedy associated with it than the other swords presented here.
