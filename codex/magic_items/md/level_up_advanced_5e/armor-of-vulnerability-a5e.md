# Armor of Vulnerability

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Armor
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This armor grants you resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The type of damage is determined when the armor is created.

**Cursed.** Once attuned to this armor, you are _cursed_  until you are targeted by __remove curse_ or similar magic; removing the armor does not end it. While cursed, you have vulnerability to the other two damage types this armor does not protect against.
