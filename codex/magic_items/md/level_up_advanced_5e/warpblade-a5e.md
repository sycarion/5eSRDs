- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This dagger cuts through space as easily as flesh. You gain a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with this magic weapon.

Weapon attacks using _warpblade_ deal an extra 2d6 force damage. While you are attuned to the dagger and take the Attack action, you can choose an object or surface within 60 feet, making one of your attacks against it (AC 10). On a successful hit, warpblade is embedded into the target. While _warpblade_ is embedded, you can use a reaction to instantly teleport yourself to an unoccupied space adjacent to it and remove it from the target. In addition, on your turn you can instantly return _warpblade_ to your hand (no action required).

_Warpblade_ has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast the following spells: __misty step_  (1 charge), __dimension door_ (2 charges), _teleport_  (3 charges).
