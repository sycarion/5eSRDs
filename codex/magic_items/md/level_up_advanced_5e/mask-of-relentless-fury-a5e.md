# Mask of Relentless Fury

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This cracked marble mask bears a toothy, unsettling grin. It perfectly fits over its wearer’s face, and though it lacks eyeholes an attuned wearer can see through it without issue.

While wearing this mask, you can’t be _blinded_ , _charmed_ , or _frightened_ , and you are immune to any effect that could be avoided by averting your eyes, such as a _medusa’s_ _Petrifying Gaze_. Insight checks against you are made with _disadvantage_ .

Using a bonus action, you can enter a fury that makes you far more dangerous. While in a fury, you gain the following benefits for the next minute, until you go _unconscious_ , or until you end your fury willingly (see below):

* You may take an additional action on each of your turns. This action can be used to make a single weapon attack, or to take the Dash or Use an Object action.
* You gain a fury score, which starts at 0 and increases by 1 at the start of each turn. Whenever you take damage, you reduce the damage by your fury score after applying any _resistances_ .
* You ignore the effects of _fatigue_ .

At the start of any future turn, after increasing your fury score, you can choose to end this fury. When your fury ends, you are _stunned_  until the end of your turn. Roll 1d8\. If the result is equal to or lower than your fury score, gain _fatigue_  equal to the result. Your fury score then resets to 0.

**_Curse._** If you gain seven levels of fatigue while wearing this mask, you don’t die. Instead, the mask takes control of your body. You clear all _exhaustion_ , then use your turn to move toward the nearest creature and attack. You continue in this rampage, seeking more foes until killed, at which point your attunement ends.

**_Escalation._** Each time you achieve a fury score of 7 or higher and survive, you gain a new property from the following list. For each of these properties you gain, your starting fury score increases by 1.

_Marble Flesh._ Each time you increase your fury score, your skin hardens, allowing you to ignore the first source of damage you take before the start of your next turn.

_Unstoppable._ When you increase your fury score you can end one effect on yourself that causes you to become _incapacitated_ .

_Witchbane._ Choose a classical school of magic. You have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against spells of that school and related magical effects.
