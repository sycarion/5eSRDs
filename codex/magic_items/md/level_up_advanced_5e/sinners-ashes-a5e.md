# Sinnerâ€™s Ashes

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This small stark urn contains the ashen remains of an unholy humanoid. As an action, you can throw the urn up to 30 feet away where it shatters and produces a 20-foot radius black cloud of ash. This area is _heavily obscured_  and any creature that ends its turn within the area must make a DC 13 Constitution _saving throw_  or take 2d4 necrotic damage. This ash cloud remains for 1 minute, until a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, or until a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

Alternatively, the ashes can be used as an ingestible poison. The urn contains enough ashes for a single dose, and any celestial that consumes them must make a DC 16 Constitution _saving throw_ , taking 5d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
