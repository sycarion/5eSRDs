# Hunter's Quiver

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You can pull an endless number of nonmagical arrows from this quiver. An arrow disappears when it is fired or if it leaves your possession for longer than 1 minute. While you carry the quiver, if no hostile creatures are within 30 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to aim, gaining _advantage_  on _ranged weapon attacks_  until the end of your turn.
