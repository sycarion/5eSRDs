This magic, sentient longsword grants a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with it. Once you have attuned to the weapon, while wielding it you gain the following features:

◆ Weapon attacks using the sword score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

◆ The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.

◆ You can use a bonus action to speak this sword’s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed _bright light_  in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d8 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

◆ You can use a bonus action to toss this sword into the air and speak a different command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover and the consciousness inside of it awakens, transforming it into a creature. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. You can transform the sword into a creature for up to 10 minutes, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. The sword regains 5 minutes of transforming capability for every 12 hours that feature is not in use.

When you act in a way that Asi finds contemptible (performing deeds that conflict with effecting the destruction of the enemies of the gods and restoring the Dharma), the sword acts under its own free will unless you succeed on an opposed Charisma check at the end of each minute.
