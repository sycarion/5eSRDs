This flask sloshes when shaken as if full of water. You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak a command word, causing undrinkable water to flow out of the flask. It stops at the start of your next turn. 

**Stream**. This command word produces 1 gallon of water.

**Fountain.** This command word produces 5 gallons of water.

**Geyser.** This command word produces 30 gallons of water that manifests as a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action, you can aim the geyser at a target within 30 feet, forcing it to make a DC 13 Strength _saving throw_  or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and be knocked _prone_ . Any object less than 200 pounds is knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away.
