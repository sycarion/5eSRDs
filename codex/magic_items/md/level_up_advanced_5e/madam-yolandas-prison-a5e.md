# Madam Yolanda’s Prison

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This large, gleaming red ruby book contains the spirit of an elven archmage named Madam Yolanda. She lived a life of adventure and riches before eventually retiring in a vast mansion with a much younger elf. Identifying the ruby causes Madam Yolanda to appear—she uses the statistics of an _archmage_  fluent in Common and Elvish, and is vain, flirtatious, and mistrustful of almost everyone’s motives. The Narrator randomly determines her attitude towards her finders using the Madam Yolanda’s Prison table.
