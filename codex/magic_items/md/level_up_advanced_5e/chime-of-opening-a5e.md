# Chime of Opening

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You can use an action to strike this foot-long metal tube while pointing it at an object that can be opened (such as a lid, lock, or window) within 120 feet. The chime sounds and one lock or latch on the object opens as long as the sound can reach the object. If no closures remain, the object itself opens. After being struck 10 times, the chime cracks and becomes useless.
