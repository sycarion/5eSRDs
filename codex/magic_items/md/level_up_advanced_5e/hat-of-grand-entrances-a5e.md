Step into the room and make a grand entrance! This top hat has embroidered figurines of trumpet players in full regalia. By speaking a command word, you can cause the figures to magically and loudly herald your arrival by trumpet blasts, followed by a speech announcing your name, titles, and any of your major accomplishments. You can alter this speech beforehand by giving any special instructions to the hat before speaking the command word. Once this hat has heralded an entrance it canâ€™t be used again for 10 minutes.
