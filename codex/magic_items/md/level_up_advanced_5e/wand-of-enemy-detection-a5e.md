# Wand of Enemy Detection

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

While holding this wand, you can use an action to speak its command word and expend 1 charge to extend your senses for 1 minute. You sense the direction (but not precise location) of the nearest creature hostile to you within 60 feet (this includes ethereal, _invisible_ , disguised, and hidden creatures, as well as those in plain sight). The effect ends early if you stop holding the wand.

This wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand disappears the next time it is unobserved.
