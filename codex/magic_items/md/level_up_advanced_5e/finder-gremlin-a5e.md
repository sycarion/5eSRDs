# Finder Gremlin

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This tiny ethereal silver goblinoid sits in a clamshell container along with a miniature cup of water and a single thin needle. When prompted with a bonus action, the gremlin uses the old cup and needle trick to try and find magnetic north, although it is not particularly good at this. Whenever the gremlin tries to find true north, roll a d10, and on a result of a 1 it gets confused, pointing in the exact opposite direction instead.
