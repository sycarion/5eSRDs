While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and touch it to one willing beast or humanoid. If the target is a humanoid, for the next hour it gains an expertise die on Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion checks, as well as on Performance checks made to act, orate, or otherwise speak in front of a crowd. If the target is a beast, it gains the ability to speak one language that you are proficient with for the next hour.

This wand has 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wand emits a cacophony of voices and animal noises audible within 100 feet for 1 minute then loses its magical properties.
