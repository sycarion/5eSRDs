| **d8** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | A small bonfire appears in the nearest unoccupied 5-foot cube and remains for 1 minute. All other sources of flame within 50 feet double in brightness.                                            |
| 2      | For the next minute you gain +1 bonus to ability checks, _attack rolls_ , damage rolls, and _saving throws_  using Strength.                                                                       |
| 3      | You summon a small, fiercely loyal armored _weasel_  into your service (with 7 hit points and Armor Class 14 thanks to its miniature mithral outfit) that obeys only your commands.                |
| 4      | A metal ball appears floating in your space and remains there until you say the command word, making it slam into the nearest hostile creature to deal 3d6 bludgeoning damage before disappearing. |
| 5      | For the next 1d6 hours your voice becomes higher by an octave.                                                                                                                                     |
| 6      | Until the next dawn you leave a trail of wildflowers wherever you walk.                                                                                                                            |
| 7      | A pair of __boots of elvenkind_ appear in the nearest unoccupied square. After this effect has appeared once, any further results of 7 are rerolled.                                               |
| 8      | All hostile creatures in a 30-foot radius are ensnared by ice. An ensnared creature is _grappled_  until it uses an action to make a DC 16 Strength check to break out.                            |
