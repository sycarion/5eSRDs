This dagger carves through minds as easily as flesh. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Weapon attacks using _mindrazor_ deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage against creatures. When you roll a natural 20 on an attack with this weapon, the target becomes _confused_  for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a confused creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence _saving throw_ , ending the effect on itself on a success.

You can use an action to work _mindrazor_ upon the memories of a _restrained_  or _incapacited_  creature within 5 feet (as __modify memory_ cast at 9th-level). Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until you have finished a _short rest_ .
