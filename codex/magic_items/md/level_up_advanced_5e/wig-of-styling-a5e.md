This wig has 2 charges and regains 1 charge each dawn. While wearing the wig, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to change the length, style, and color of the wig. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\. On a 1, the wig is fixed in its current length, style, and color, becoming a mundane item.
