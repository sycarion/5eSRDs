# Idol of Light

- **Rarity:** Very Rare
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This glass idol resembles a humanoid woman with a set of iridescent butterfly wings and a crystalline crown. The idol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet at all times. It has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges each day if exposed to the light of dawn. You can expend the idolâ€™s charges to produce the following effects:

* When you take radiant or necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain _resistance_  to that damage type for the next minute or until you use this property again.
* As an action, you can expend 2 charges to make the idol shed light, as if by the __daylight_ spell, for 10 minutes.
* As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast __dispel magic_ , targeting an illusion or necromancy spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.
* As a bonus action, you can expend 4 charges to cause the idol to flare with blinding light. Creatures you choose within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution _saving throw_  or be _blinded_  until the end of your next turn. Undead make the save with _disadvantage_ .
