You can use an action to throw this green vial at a point within 20 feet. The vial shatters on impact and creates a 5-foot-radius cloud of poison gas. A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution _saving throw_  or take 2d6 poison damage and become _poisoned_  until the end of its next turn. The area inside the cloud is _lightly obscured_ . The cloud remains for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.
