You gain a +2 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  with this magic quarterstaff. In addition, while holding it you gain a +2 bonus to _spell attack rolls_ .

While holding this staff, you can use an action to sense the direction of magnetic north (nothing happens if the staff is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) Alternatively, you can use an action to expend charges to cast one of the following spells (spell save DC 15): __feather fall_  (1 charge), __jump_ (1 charge), _levitate_  (2 charges), __telekinesis_  (5 charges), _reverse gravity_  (7 charges).

The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the staff loses its magical properties.
