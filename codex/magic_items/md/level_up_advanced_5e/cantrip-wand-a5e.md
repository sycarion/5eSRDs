# Cantrip Wand

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wand
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

This wand can be used as a spellcasting focus and allows you to cast one additional cantrip as if you knew it, as long as it is on your spell list. Each cantrip wand has a cantrip imbued within it upon creation, and will be known by its name (such as a _fire bolt_  wand or __light  wand_). 

Other implements exist for the storing of cantrips from other classes (like _cantrip holy symbols_ or _cantrip instruments_), and though these are wondrous items they function like wands.
