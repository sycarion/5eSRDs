# Contract of Indentured Service

- **Rarity:** Common
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

Necromancers occasionally act as apparent benefactors, offering loans to victims now in exchange for service after death. This contract details an account of a spirit that has become indentured to the contract’s holder. While holding the contract, you can speak the command word as an action to summon the _invisible_  undead spirit, which functions as the spell __unseen servant_ . You can’t do so again until you finish a _long rest_ .

Alternatively, you can use an action to tear up the contract and release the undead spirit. The spirit appears as a friendly **_specter_**  you can telepathically command (as a bonus action) for as long as you maintain _concentration_ . The specter acts immediately after your turn. If your concentration is broken, the specter attacks you and your companions. Otherwise the specter disappears 10 minutes after it is summoned, vanishing to whichever afterlife awaits it.
