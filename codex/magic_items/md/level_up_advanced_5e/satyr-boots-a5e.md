# Satyr Boots

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

You gain an expertise die on Performance checks made to dance while you wear these finely-crafted boots. As an action, you can transform your legs and feet into the furry haunches and cloven hooves of a goat. The transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you use another action to return to your normal form. While transformed, your base Speed becomes 40 feet, you gain an expertise die on Acrobatics checks, and you ignore _nonmagical difficult terrain_ . When the effect ends, the boots fall apart and become useless until a properly trained _satyr_  cobbler repairs them for you.
