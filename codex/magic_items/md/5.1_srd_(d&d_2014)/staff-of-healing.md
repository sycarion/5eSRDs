# Staff of Healing

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** No
- **Source:** 5.1 SRD (D&D 2014)

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: _cure wounds_ (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), _lesser restoration_ (2 charges), or _mass cure wounds_ (5 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
