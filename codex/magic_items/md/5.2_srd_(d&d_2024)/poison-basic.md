As a Bonus Action, you can use a vial of Basic Poison to coat one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from the poisoned weapon or ammunition takes an extra 1d4 Poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute or until its damage is dealt, whichever comes first.
