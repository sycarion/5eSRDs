While holding or wearing this talisman, you have Advantage on any Intelligence (Arcana) check you make to control a Sphere of Annihilation. In addition, when you start your turn in control of a Sphere of Annihilation, you can take a Magic action to move it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier. This movement doesn't have to be in a straight line.
