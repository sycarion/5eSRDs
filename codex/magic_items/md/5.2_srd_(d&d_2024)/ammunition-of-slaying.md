This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one. After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.
