You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC. Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
