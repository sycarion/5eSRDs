# Equipment

## Starting Equipment

Choices made during character creation provide a list of default gear, but there is also the option to forgo this standard list and select items that you feel better fit your character. Choose your class from the table below and spend the allotted amount of gold on equipment.

**TABLE: STARTING GOLD PER CLASS**

| CLASS | FUNDS |
| :---- | :---: |
| Adept | 30 gp |
| Bard | 135 gp |
| Berserker | 120 gp |
| Cleric | 125 gp |
| Druid | 115 gp |
| Fighter | 140 gp |
| Herald | 200 gp |
| Marshal | 200 gp |
| Ranger | 150 gp |
| Rogue | 125 gp |
| Sorcerer | 100 gp |
| Warlock | 110 gp |
| Wizard | 100 gp |

## Trading

While gold pieces and other coinage are used to describe the value of items, they are not the only way wealth manifests itself in the world. Gems, information, services, and exchanged goods are useful ways for the average person to acquire what they need. Working people of every stripe may find it easier to barter day-to-day, and many local governments accept taxes in valuable items that meet the amount due—whether that be poultry or fine wines. The wealthy may trade in the same way, albeit on a grander scale such as with deeds, parcels of land, or full bars of precious metal.

## Currency

The average day’s wage for a skilled artisan such as a tailor, carpenter, or armorer is a single gold piece.  
One gold piece is equivalent to 10 silver pieces. A silver piece is half a day’s wages for an unskilled laborer.  
One silver piece is equivalent to 10 copper pieces, the most common coinage amongst the lower-paid working class.  
Other coins of less common metals may be found while traveling. Electrum and platinum are not unheard of, but may not spend easily. Cautious merchants may avoid unfamiliar currency to avoid being duped by a forgery.  
On average, 50 coins of any value weigh 1 pound.

## Trading Valuables

### Used Weapons, Armor, and Equipment

Used equipment in good working order will usually sell, but it may be worth half (or even less) than a new item. This is not a hard-and-fast situation, and vendors may be swayed into offering more—how your character persuades someone to do that is up to them.

**TABLE: EXCHANGE RATES AND RELATIVE VALUE**

| CURRENCY | COPPER PIECE | SILVER PIECE | ELECTRUM PIECE | GOLD PIECE | PLATINUMPIECE |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Copper | 1 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/1,000 |
| Silver | 10 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/100 |
| Electrum | 50 | 5 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/20 |
| Gold | 100 | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1/10 |
| Platinum | 1,000 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 1 |
| Common Goods | Soap | One sheet of parchment | One day of rations (1 Supply) | Bedroll | A bottle of ink |

### Magic Items

The ease of selling magic items differs from place to place. If in a region where magic is commonplace, selling these items is relatively straightforward. In regions where magic is rare, vendors may not believe the item is genuine, let alone be willing to buy it. If they can be sold, magic items are valuable and often cost more gold than the average person would see in a lifetime.

### Treasure and Art

Items such as gems, precious metals, jewelry, and art are valuable because they are sought after across the world. For this reason they rarely diminish in price and may even gain value as time goes by. Lost relics or pieces by master crafters are especially likely to bring in vast amounts of gold, despite their lack of magical or practical utility.

### Basic Trade Goods

Trade goods such as grain, salt, and domesticated beasts are sought after everywhere and so are unlikely to diminish much in value from place to place.

**TABLE: TRADE GOODS**

| COST | GOODS |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 cp | 1 lb. of wheat |
| 2 cp | 1 lb. of flour |
| 5 cp | 1 lb. of salt |
| 1 sp | 1 lb. of iron |
| 5 sp | 1 lb. of copper |
| 1 gp | 1 lb. of ginger |
| 2 gp | 1 lb. of pepper |
| 3 gp | 1 lb. of cloves |
| 5 gp | 1 lb. of silver |
| 10 gp | 1 cow |
| 15 gp | 1 lb. of saffron |
| 50 gp | 1 lb. of gold |
| 500 gp | 1 lb. of platinum |
| 100 gp | 1 lb. of cold iron |
| 750 gp | 1 lb. of mithral |
| 1,000 gp | 1 lb. of adamantine |

# Armor, Shields, and Weaponry

## Weapons

You gain proficiency with certain weapons depending on your class, heritage, and other features. Different weapons deal different amounts of damage, have different properties, and can be used to attack from different ranges. Melee weapons are held or thrown, while ranged weapons propel ammunition great distances. When making an attack with a weapon, you add either your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the roll, depending on the weapon’s type, as well as your proficiency bonus, if applicable.  
**Simple Weapons.** All NPC humanoids are proficient with simple weapons, and adventurers are able to wield most of them (if not all). The list of simple melee weapons include the club, dagger, handaxe, greatclub, mace, quarterstaff, sickle, and spear, and simple ranged weapons include the blowgun, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and sling.  
In addition to being noted in its properties, a simple weapon is also marked with **S**.  
**Martial Weapons.** Martial weapons are more complicated to use and require training to be proficient with. You must be proficient with a weapon to gain your proficiency bonus on attack rolls made with it. Unless noted otherwise, weapons are considered martial weapons.  
**Rare Weapons.** Unless a trait or feature grants it, you can only gain proficiency with a rare weapon by training during downtime. Depending on the campaign setting and at the Narrator’s discretion, some rare weapons may be considered martial weapons or they may not exist at all.

## Weapon Attacks

All creatures are proficient with their natural weapons and unarmed strikes. Unless otherwise noted, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 \+ Strength modifier. Attacks made with natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered to be melee weapon attacks, and a thrown weapon is considered to be a ranged weapon attack. Creatures have a reach of 5 feet with their melee weapon attacks, though larger creatures may have greater reach.

### Melee Weapons

Adventurers use a wide variety of weapons in hand-to-hand combat. The table below indicates some of the most common melee weaponry, though different cultures name weapons differently, and some weapons are completely unique (see Cultural Weapons). If you want to use a weapon not listed here, see Customizing Armaments. A melee weapon uses your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls.

### Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons require ammunition to use. If you use a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, it is treated as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to be used in this way. A ranged weapon uses your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls.

### 

### Weapon Properties

All weapons may deal the same basic types of damage, but they also have special properties that make each unique. You can only benefit from properties marked with † if you are proficient with the weapon.  
**Breaker.** This weapon deals double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parentheses after this property.  
**Compounding†.** You can only use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  
**Defensive†.** This weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.  
**Dual-Wielding†.** This weapon is designed to be wielded in concert with another weapon. When wielding another weapon in your main hand that does not have the heavy property, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with this weapon.  
**Finesse.** You may choose to use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.  
**Hand-Mounted†.** This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage on saving throws made to resist being disarmed. You can’t use a hand that is wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket, using thieves’ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen components.  
**Heavy**. A small creature has disadvantage on attack rolls made with this weapon.  
**Loading**. This weapon must be loaded before it can be used. You can only make one attack with a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, even if you can normally make more attacks.  
**Mounted†.** This weapon deals the damage listed in parentheses when you are wielding it while mounted.  
**Parrying†.** When you are wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while incapacitated, paralyzed, rattled, restrained, or stunned.  
**Parrying Immunity**. Attacks with this weapon ignore the parrying property and Armor Class bonuses from shields.  
**Range**. This weapon fires ammunition. The range lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range.  
**Reach**. This weapon can be used to make attacks against targets within 10 feet. If a weapon has a longer reach, it is stated in parentheses after this property.  
**Simple**. This weapon can be used with very little skill or training, and all creatures gain proficiency with it.  
**Thrown.** This weapon can be thrown as a ranged weapon attack. The thrown property lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal thrown range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range. Additionally, when using this weapon to make a ranged weapon attack, you may choose to use your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage roll.  
**Trip†.** When used with a combat maneuver that trips a creature or the Knockdown maneuver, this weapon increases your Maneuver DC by 1\. If the target is mounted, your Maneuver DC is instead increased by 2\.  
**Two-Handed**. You must use two hands to wield this weapon.  
**Versatile**. This weapon can be wielded with one or both hands. If wielded with both hands, it deals the damage listed in parentheses.  
**Vicious.** A vicious weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20\. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17–20).

### Improvised Weapons

At the Narrator’s discretion, an improvised weapon that is similar to a weapon with the simple property may be treated as a simple weapon. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type determined by the Narrator. Improvised thrown weapons have a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet.

**TABLE: AMMUNITION**

| AMMUNITION | COST | WEIGHT |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Arrows (20) | 1 gp | 1 lb. |
| Blowgun needles (50) | 1 gp | 1 lb. |
| Crossbow bolts (20) | 1 gp | 1 ½ lbs. |
| Explosive arrows (4) | 80 gp | 1/2 lb. |
| Firearm bullets (10) | 10 gp | 1 ½ lbs. |
| Flaming arrows (4) | 60 gp | 1/2 lb. |
| Punching arrows (4) | 100 gp | 1 lb. |
| Sling bullets (20) | 4 cp | 1 ½ lbs. |

### Ammunition

Ranged weapons require ammunition to fire. Typically that ammunition is made from bone, bronze, iron, steel, or wood; sling pellets are usually stone or metal. However at the Narrator’s discretion, special ammunition may be available.  
**Explosive.** An attack made with explosive ammunition cannot benefit from expertise dice and can only hit targets within its normal range, but on a hit it deals an extra 1d6 thunder damage.  
**Flaming.** This ammunition can be lit as a bonus action. A weapon firing this ammunition can only hit targets within its normal range, but on a hit it deals an extra 1d4 fire damage.  
**Punching.** On a critical hit, this ammunition decreases an armored target’s Armor Class by 1\. This cannot reduce the target’s Armor Class to less than 10 \+ its Dexterity modifier.

### Cultural Weapons

Many weapons have equivalents in various cultures, both in the real world and in fantasy campaign settings. Below is a selection of weapons from different cultures you may choose to include in your game. Availability of these weapons is at the discretion of the Narrator.  
**Boomerang (Aboriginal, 5 sp).** There are many forms of boomerang. This club has the thrown property (range 100/300) and cannot be used as a melee weapon. A boomerang designed to flush out or distract prey flies a shorter distance (range 50/150), but on a miss it returns to the space it was thrown from at the end of the turn.  
**Butterfly Sword (Chinese, 20 gp).** These use the statistics of shortswords and are usually wielded in pairs. They have the dual-wielding property.  
**Chakram (Indian, 2 gp).** This circular, bladed throwing weapon uses the statistics of a ring blade.  
**Claymore (Scottish, 50 gp).** This cross-hilted weapon uses the statistics of a greatsword.  
**Dao (Chinese, 20 gp).** A curved broadsword that uses the statistics of a scimitar.  
**Hooked Hammer (Gnomish, 15 gp).** This uses the statistics of a small warhammer that does 1d6 bludgeoning or piercing damage and has the trip property.  
**Katana (Japanese, 60 gp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a fine bastard sword.  
**Khopesh (Egyptian, 1 gp).** This sickle-shaped sword uses the statistics of a scimitar.  
**Kusarigama (Japanese, 10 gp).** This is a sickle on a chain. It uses the statistics of a sickle that weighs 5 pounds and has the dual-wielding, parrying immunity, reach (10 ft.), and two-handed properties.  
**Labrys (Greek, 10 gp).** This ornate weapon uses the statistics of a battleaxe. It has two blades, one on each side of the haft.  
**Machahuitl (Aztec, 30 gp).** This club with embedded obsidian blades functions as a fine longsword.  
**Main-Gauche (European, 4 gp).** This parrying dagger may be used as a dagger or as a light shield.  
**Nine-Section Whip (Chinese, 15 gp).** This whip deals 1d6 slashing damage.  
**Ninjato (Japanese, 20 gp).** This uses the statistics of a straight-bladed shortsword with the storage property (often used to contain poison).  
**Nunchaku (Okinawan, 1 gp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a club but is considered a double weapon.  
**Rungu (Zambian, 3 sp).** This club has the thrown property (range 30/150).  
**Shuriken (Japanese, 3 sp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a throwing dagger. It deals only 1 damage if used in melee. It has the quickdraw property.  
**Slingstaff (Halfling, 1 gp).** This weapon can be used as a quarterstaff or as a sling.  
**Spiked Gauntlets (Any, 8 gp).** Spiked gauntlets function as brass knuckles but deal piercing damage.  
**Stonebow (Dwarven, 25 gp).** This weapon functions as a shortbow, but fires sling bullets that inflict bludgeoning damage.  
**Tessen (Japanese, 5 gp).** This war fan can be used as a light shield and as a dagger, and has the flamboyant property.  
**Thinblade (Elven, 50 gp).** This weapon uses the statistics of a rapier but is so sharp that it has the vicious property.  
**Tomahawk (Native American, 5 gp).** A tomahawk uses the statistics of a handaxe.  
**Urgosh (Dwarven, 20 gp).** This spear-and-axe double weapon can be used as either.  
**Wakizashi (Japanese, 15 gp).** This blade uses the statistics of a shortsword.  
**Wooden Stake (Any, 0 gp).** This simple weapon uses the statistics of a dagger, but any vampire reduced to 0 hit points with it is permanently destroyed. It is made of wood.

### Rare Melee Weapons

Most rare melee weapons are secretive, meant to be concealed or utilize a hidden advantage to take foes by surprise.  
**Assassin’s Gauntlet/Boot Dagger.** At a glance this item seems to be perfectly typical, but it conceals a spring-loaded blade deployed by pressing a switch when it is used to make an attack. A creature observing it only realizes that the item is a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the weapon is being worn at the time and not deployed). Once deployed, a bonus action is required to resheathe the blade. You gain an expertise die on your attack roll when you deploy this weapon as part of an attack against a target that is unaware you have it.  
**Double Weapon.** Wielded not unlike a quarterstaff, each side of this weapon has a blade, weighted head, or other injurious implement. Most double weapons are two-bladed swords or double-axes, but there have been gnome warriors known to wield hooked hammers and elvish clades specialized in swordspears. Double weapons use the statistics for whichever weapon is used to attack and are considered to have the dual-wielding and parrying properties.  
**Mercurial Maul.** The liquid metal inside of the shaft and head of this weapon makes it difficult to wield but all the deadlier in expert hands. The minimum result on a damage die rolled with this weapon is a 2\.  
**Ring Blade.** This metal hoop has sharpened edges that make it deadly whether thrown or used in hand. It costs only 1 exertion point to use the Ricochet combat maneuver with this weapon. In addition, when you throw this weapon, you can make the attack with disadvantage. If you do and the attack hits, the weapon returns to your hand.  
**Shields.** At the Narrator’s discretion, shields may be treated as rare weapons to gain proficiency with them for attack rolls.  
**Sword Pistol.** When this weapon is used to hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to fire the gun in the handle, gaining a 1d6 expertise die on an immediate ranged weapon attack against the same target.

### Rare Ranged Weapons

Ranged rare weapons require ammunition to use, although some firearms can hold multiple bullets at a time.  
**Geared Slingshot.** Constructed much like a crossbow, this shoulder-mounted weapon bears a striking resemblance to a miniature catapult. It is typically used to fire hand-sized rocks but any Tiny object can be used as ammunition instead.  
**Ratcheting Crossbow.** This crossbow has a large winding wheel affixed to its drawstring. The wheel feeds into extra machinery along the stock that catches and pulls the string back again after it is fired. Winding a ratcheting crossbow for a single bolt requires a bonus action or action, and it can be wound to prepare two bolts. Masterwork ratcheting crossbows can either be constructed to fire up to four bolts or made smaller (with statistics like a hand crossbow).  
**Revolver.** When a revolver is loaded, it holds up to 6 bullets. The revolver only needs to be loaded after all of its ammunition has been fired.  
**Shotgun.** When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with advantage, the attack becomes a critical hit if both d20 rolls would result in a hit. When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with disadvantage and only one attack roll would result in a hit, you instead deal 1d4 piercing damage (adding no bonuses to damage from ability score modifiers or enchantments).

## 

## Shields

Shields can range from a dueler’s fencing buckler to the tower shields of mercenary armies. You may wield two shields, but only gain the defensive benefits of one shield at a time. When it is used to attack, a shield is treated as an improvised weapon that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage.  
Donning a shield grants you no benefit to Armor Class if you are not proficient with shields, and you can’t take cover behind it, plant it on the ground, or sacrifice it.  
A creature one size category larger than the shield was designed for treats it as a shield that is one degree lighter, while a creature one size category smaller treats it as a shield that is one degree heavier. If that would make a light shield lighter or a heavy shield heavier, the shield cannot be used by that creature.  
The costs and weights in Table: Shields are for shields made from steel.  
**Light**. Light shields increase your Armor Class by 1\. You can throw this shield, treating it as an improvised weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.  
**Medium**. Medium shields increase your Armor Class by 2\.  
**Heavy**. Heavy shields increase your Armor Class by 2 and you gain an expertise die on Dexterity saving throws. When you take the Dodge action while wielding a heavy shield, you may instead take cover behind your shield, gaining an expertise die to your Armor Class until the start of your turn. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wielding a heavy shield, and you cannot squeeze through spaces smaller than your size category.  
**Tower**. Tower shields share the properties of a heavy shield. These shields cover the entire body and reduce your Speed by 10 feet. On your turn, you may use an object interaction to plant it in the ground, gaining half cover (+2 bonus to AC, Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks made to hide) and advantage on saving throws made to resist being shoved or knocked prone while you remain behind it. Unplanting a tower shield requires a bonus action.  
Tower shields are bulky items, and count as such even when donned.

### Improvised Shields

If you are proficient with shields, you can use an action to pick up a nearby object of your size category or larger to use as a shield. The size of the object determines the degree of shield it becomes: an object your size can be used as a light shield, or an object of one size category larger can be used as a medium shield.  
An improvised shield is destroyed when you take a critical hit (it cannot be sacrificed), it cannot be repaired or customized, and it becomes useless after 10 rounds of combat.

### Sacrifice Shield

When you are subjected to a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block the attack and sacrifice your shield, turning the critical hit into a regular hit. Afterwards, your shield is broken. If your shield is magical, it instead becomes mundane for 1 hour.

**TABLE: SHIELDS**

| SHIELD | COST | WEIGHT | AC BONUS |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Light | 10 gp | 4 lbs. | \+1 |
| Medium | 20 gp | 8 lbs. | \+2 |
| Heavy | 35 gp | 20 lbs. | \+2 |
| Tower | 75 gp | 25 lbs | \+2 |

## Armor

The durability of your armor is a combination of the style of armor and its material. Less durable materials, such as cloth and leather, are comfortable, lightweight, and inexpensive but struggle to turn a hit. Metals may turn a hit more easily, but they require more physical strength to wear and cost more coin. The different styles of armor are outlined below.  
While wearing armor you aren’t proficient with, you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws using Strength or Dexterity, and you are unable to cast spells.  
**Padded**. Layers of cloth or supple leather are quilted together to create a lightweight tunic and pair of trousers. Padded cloth tunics are worn under breastplates and suits of mail for comfort, and are already counted in their AC.  
**Brigandine**. A tunic made of cloth, leather, or hide with small panels of metal, scale, or bone stitched to the interior for extra protection. When the panels are external and overlap closely, the brigandine is termed scale mail.  
**Breastplate**. A fitted bone, leather, or metal plate that covers the chest, stomach, and vital organs.  
**Mail**. A suit made entirely of metal, though styles can differ greatly. A chain shirt is a shirt woven from small metal rings, while a full set of chain mail (a hauberk) is longer and includes a coiff. Half plate covers most of the body in shaped metal plates but offers minimal leg protection, while full plate covers the entire body and includes gauntlets, boots, and a helm. Splint mail is similar to half plate but covers the limbs in strips of mail bolted to leather, rather than shaped metal plates.  
**Bulky Armor.** Half plate and full plate are bulky, but while worn they do not count against the number of bulky items you can carry at once.

### Helms

Helms fit over your head to protect your skull, though in exchange they limit your vision and hearing. No proficiency is required to wear a helm.  
**Helm.** This hard leather or metal covering protects the head but not the face, with the exception of a strip over the nose. While wearing this helm you gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being stunned or rattled, and your passive Perception score is reduced by 2\.  
**Visored Helm.** This helm covers the entirety of the head, including the face; the visor can be moved out of the way of the face as by interacting with an object, in which case the visored helm functions as a standard helm. While wearing a visored helm you gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being charmed, rattled, or stunned, and your passive Perception score is reduced by 5\.  
Additionally, whenever you take damage from falling, you reduce that damage by 5\.

### Donning, Doffing, Sizing, and Sleeping in Armor

**TABLE: DONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR**

| CATEGORY | DON | DOFF |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Light Armor | 1 minute | 1 minute |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes | 1 minute |
| Heavy Armor | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield | 1 action | 1 action |

Armor is typically fitted to its wearer. When you first acquire a set of nonmagical armor, you must make or pay for alterations. Making the alterations yourself requires tool proficiencies as if you were repairing the armor. If the armor is not appropriately sized to you but is of your size category, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of each day you wear the armor, gaining a level of fatigue on a failure. You can alter armor that is a size category larger than you are, but you cannot fit into armor that is too small.  
It is assumed that cloth armor is worn under breastplates and suits of mail. Aside from cloth, leather, and hide, armor is too runcomfortable for a restful night’s sleep. If you sleep in medium or heavy armor other than hide, you are roughing it. You regain half the usual number of Hit Dice, and if you have any levels of fatigue or strife, neither is reduced upon finishing the long rest.  
An armor’s category determines how long it takes to don (put on) or doff (take off) that armor.  
**Don.** Your Armor Class is only increased by armor you have fully donned.  
**Doff.** If you have help, halve this time.

**TABLE: MATERIALS**

| DESCRIPTION | WEIGHT | COST | PROPERTIES | REPAIRABILITY |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | :---- | :---- |
| **Adamantine** |  |  |  |  |
| As weighty as iron, as flexible as steel, and harder than both, adamantine is the most durable material for weapons and armor, as well as the most expensive. | ×1.5 | ×4 | Hardy, low- maintenance (advantage), weighty (+2) | DC 25; smith’s tools, access to a forge |
| **Bone** |  |  |  |  |
| Bones can be shaped into points for arrows and spears or tied together, along with shells and scales, to form a durable but high-maintenance armor. Due to its brittleness, bone requires constant repairs and has a short lifespan. | ×1/2 | ×1/4 | Flaw, lightweight | DC 10; sewing kit Weapons are not repairable |
| **Bronze** |  |  |  |  |
| Bronze is durable but weighty, and tends to be more brittle than steel. | ×1.5 | ×3/4 | Weighty (+1) | DC 12; smith’s tools |
| **Cloth** |  |  |  |  |
| Cloth is the flimsiest of materials but also the lightest. Padded layers can be worn as independent armor or underneath metal armors to increase comfort. | — | — | Comfortable, flaw (piercing), underarmor | DC 5; sewing kit |
| **Cold iron** |  |  |  |  |
| Alloys of iron and phosphorus are called cold iron. Cold iron is a semi-magical material that many fey creatures are vulnerable to. | — | x2 | Feybane | DC 20; smith’s tools |
| **Hide** |  |  |  |  |
| Tanned animal hides offer more protection than cloth, but are still easily punctured by blades and arrows. Leather that is left untreated or with the fur or scales still on is known as hide. | — | — | Comfortable, wild | DC 10; sewing kit |
| **Iron** |  |  |  |  |
| Iron is weighty and brittle, typically alloyed with carbon (to form steel). | ×1.5 | ×1/2 | Rust, weighty (+2) Iron gear can rust if left unmaintained, particularly after exposure to water. | DC 15; smith’s tools |
| **DESCRIPTION** | **WEIGHT** | **COST** | **PROPERTIES** | **REPAIRABILITY** |
| **Leather** |  |  |  |  |
| Tanned animal hides offer more protection than cloth, but are still easily punctured by blades and arrows. | — | — | Flaw (piercing) | DC 10; sewing kit |
| **Mithral** |  |  |  |  |
| Lighter than steel, mithral is a prized material for its ability to be worked into light, comfortable, and beautiful armor or weapons. | ×1/2 | ×3 | High-quality, lightweight, low-maintenance (advantage) | DC 25; smith’s tools, access to a forge |
| **Silver** |  |  |  |  |
| Usually an iron-silver alloy rather than pure silver. |  | ×2 | Silvered | DC 20; smith’s tools |
| **Steel** |  |  |  |  |
| Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon that is lighter and sturdier than its counterparts, but it requires skill and intense heat to make. Steel is the basis of many sets of armor, including chain, plate, and the metalwork inside brigandine. | — | — | Low-maintenance (expertise die) | DC 15; smith’s tools, access to a forge |
| **Stone** |  |  |  |  |
| Hard and heavy. Stone is quite brittle and any object beyond a knapped short blade can be challenging to shape. | ×2 | Weapons ×1/2 Armor ×3 | Fortified, weighty (+2) | Not repairable |
| **Wood** |  |  |  |  |
| Wood is widely accessible and typically used for weapons. Weapons made of wood tend to be fire-hardened with special oils to increase their durability. | — | — | Flaw (armor only) | DC 15 woodworker’s tools |

## 

## Fine and Masterwork

Some weapons and armor are crafted with extreme skill, often as the crowning accomplishment of a craftsperson’s life. These pieces are visually distinctive and cost more than similar items of lower quality. Typically, only masterwork items are enchanted, as flimsier pieces tend to not be able to withstand the magical forces—a fine item can become a magic item of up to uncommon rarity, and a masterwork item can become a magic item of up to any rarity. When purchasing or commissioning a masterwork item, work with the Narrator to determine what it looks like, who made it, and how it could be enchanted in future.  
A fine item costs at least 25 gp or full price plus 50 percent, whichever is greater. A masterwork item costs at least 125 gp or full price plus 100 percent, whichever is greater.  
An item must be originally created as a fine or masterwork item; it cannot be upgraded to a higher quality level.

## Customizing Armaments

Many weapons and pieces of armor have slight differences across cultures and are referred to with different names (see Cultural Weapons). If you wish to use a weapon that is functionally similar to one on this table, work with the Narrator to determine how it changes visually. You may also use a combination of the weapon or armor properties and the additional properties listed here to create functionally distinct gear.  
As a rule of thumb, weapons should have no more than three properties unless one of those properties is a restriction. Shields and armor should have no more than two properties.  
Particularly skilled craftspeople may be able to include the following properties when crafting standard gear. Typically, such an addition costs a minimum of 50 gp or the full cost of the base item, whichever is higher.  
**Camouflaged (Armor Only).** The terrain type for camouflaged armor is chosen when it is crafted. You gain an expertise die on Stealth checks while wearing camouflaged armor crafted for the terrain you are in.  
**Flamboyant (Weapons Only).** Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist being distracted by this weapon, and you have advantage on Intimidation or Performance checks made with the use of it.  
**Quickdraw (Weapons Only)**. If you would normally only be able to draw one of these weapons on a turn, you can instead draw a number equal to the number of attacks you make.  
**Rebounding (Thrown Weapons and Shields Only)**. When you make a ranged attack with this weapon or shield, you can make the attack with disadvantage. If you do and the attack hits, the weapon returns to your hand. Piercing weapons cannot have this trait.  
**Spiked (Armor Only).** A creature that begins its turn grappling you takes 1 piercing damage while you are wearing spiked armor.  
**Stealthy**. This armor or weapon has been disguised to look like a piece of clothing or other normal item. A creature observing the item only realizes that it is armor or a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the armor is being worn at the time or the weapon is sheathed).  
**Storage**. This item contains a hidden compartment the size of a small vial. On weapons, this compartment might have a release that allows liquid placed in the compartment, such as poison, to flow out and coat the blade or head. You can use a bonus action to release the liquid stored in a weapon.

### Customizing Shields

Some shields have special properties to respond to specific situations.  
**Hands-Free (25 gp)**. This shield mounts to your arm, leaving your hand free. You cannot wield a weapon with this hand unless it has the hand-mounted property. Only light shields can be hands-free. Hands-free shields cannot be thrown.  
**Mirrored (50 gp)**. Only shields of fine or masterwork quality can be mirrored. This shield has been polished to a mirror-like finish capable of showing a reflection. When you would be targeted or affected by a gaze effect, you can use your reaction to cause the effect to instead target either the source of the effect or a creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. While wearing this shield you have disadvantage on Stealth checks.  
**Spikes (75 gp)**. Some shields are equipped with spikes. When you use your shield to make an attack, you deal 1d4 piercing damage instead of 1d4 bludgeoning damage. When you use your shield to shove or knock someone prone, but would not normally deal damage, you also deal 1d4 piercing damage on a success. Only light or medium shields can be spiked in this way.

## Maintenance

Like all gear, mundane weapons and armor wear out over time, and keeping them in good working order requires maintenance and repair. Regular day-to-day maintenance is assumed—your bowstring is oiled, your blade is sharpened, and your armor is polished. However, adventurers frequently encounter unusual events that are exceptionally hard on gear. In that case, the Narrator can call for a DC 10 maintenance check (or DC 15 if the stress was particularly severe). If you are proficient with the tools required to repair your gear (as listed in Table: Materials), add your proficiency bonus to the check. On a success, the gear is restored to full working order. On a failure or until the roll is made successfully, the gear is damaged.  
**Damaged.** An action is required to draw a damaged weapon or prepare a damaged spellcasting focus. Travel pace is halved for a damaged vehicle.  
Some examples of when the Narrator may call for a maintenance check include:

* After the party traverses difficult terrain, such as mud or water.  
* After the party has a particularly messy combat encounter.  
* After a party member fails a check that could result in damage to gear (like failing an Athletics check to climb and taking falling damage).  
* After a party member drops to 0 hit points (with one check per instance, if applicable).  
* After a party member is swallowed by a creature.

When you fail a maintenance check and your gear is already damaged, it becomes broken and cannot be used with its full effectiveness until repaired.  
**Broken.** A broken item is also damaged. A broken weapon deals half damage. The bonus to Armor Class granted by broken armor and broken shields is halved (minimum 1). The bonus to Armor Class granted by armor equals its AC – 10\.  
Repairing damaged or broken gear requires a tool check against the DC listed for the gear’s material. You can make one check to repair gear per short or long rest, or you can hire someone to repair the gear for you (which is an automatic success). The typical cost for hiring out the repair of broken or damaged gear is equal to 1/5th the item’s cost.

## 

## Material Properties

The materials a weapon or suit of armor is made from determines how best it protects the adventurer using it, as well as how it needs to be maintained.  
**Comfortable.** Armor with this property is comfortable enough to sleep in without penalty.  
**Feybane.** When using a feybane weapon, you have advantage on attacks made against fey. While you are wearing feybane armor, fey have disadvantage on attacks made against you.  
**Flaw.** A weapon with the flaw property breaks when you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll made with it. Armors break when you are subjected to a critical hit or roll a natural 1 on a Dexterity saving throw. If a damage type is noted in parentheses, the armor only breaks on a critical hit from that damage type, or the weapon only breaks if it does damage of that damage type.  
**Fortified.** Fortified armor increases the Armor Class it grants by 1\.  
**Hardy.** While wearing hardy armor, the first critical hit against you since your last short rest becomes a normal hit. You cannot use this feature again until you make adjustments to the armor during a short or long rest.  
**High-Quality.** These weapons and armor are considered one quality level higher (standard becomes fine, and fine becomes masterwork).  
**Lightweight.** If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the lightweight version of the armor doesn’t.  
**Low-Maintenance.** You gain advantage or an expertise die on maintenance checks made on low-maintenance gear.  
**Rust.** When exposed to water and not maintained, this gear cannot be repaired.  
**Silvered.** Weapons made from an alloy of silver are considered silvered for the purposes of damage resistances.  
**Underarmor.** This armor can be worn under medium and heavy armors.  
**Weighty.** The heaviness of some materials results in an increase to the armor’s Strength requirement, if the armor has one. The increase is noted in parentheses.  
**Wild.** While wearing wild armor, you cannot gain expertise dice on Deception and Persuasion checks made in urban environments.

# Adventuring Gear

## Medicinals

Not everyone has access to magical healing spells. The following herbal remedies and potions may be commonly available from apothecaries and herbalists, at the Narrator’s discretion.  
Drinking or administering a potion or remedy takes an action.  
Expertise dice granted by the use of a medicinal can be gained from that type of medicinal only once between long rests.  
**Adderwort Roots.** Chewing these dark roots bolsters your body’s natural defenses, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Constitution saving throws for 1 hour.  
**Antitoxin.** Consuming the dark bitter liquid in this vial removes the poisoned condition, and you gain advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour.  
**Bandage**. These strips of sterilized cloth stanch bleeding and cover wounds. You can use an action to apply a bandage to yourself or another creature to end ongoing piercing or slashing damage. When using improvised bandages, there is a 50 percent chance of exposure to a disease.  
**Dried Yewclaw Bark.** Eating strips of this dried yellow bark calms and clarifies the mind, and after consuming this bark you gain an expertise die on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour.  
**Fairy Cap**. Consuming this small red mushroom cap removes inhibitions and creates confidence, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Charisma saving throws for 1 hour.  
**Healer’s Satchel**. This leather pouch contains medical implements used to patch up wounds. As an action, you can expend one use of this item to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check.  
**Healing Potion**. These potions have auras of evocation magic invisible to mundane eyes.  
*Basic:* When you drink the bright red liquid in this flask, you regain 2d4 \+ 2 hit points.  
*Greater:* When you drink the pure red concoction in this flask, you regain 4d4 \+ 4 hit points.  
*Superior:* Requiring rare ingredients, the recipes for these potions are jealously guarded by master herbalists. When you drink the glowing crimson liquid in this vial, you regain 8d4 \+ 8 hit points.  
*Supreme:* Only a few herbalists every generation master the precise artistry required to brew these serums. When you drink the iridescent liquid in this vial you regain 10d4 \+ 20 hit points.  
**Ironwood Acorn**. This tough acorn must be swallowed whole to fortify your muscles and sinews, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Strength saving throws for 1 hour.  
**Jar of Leeches.** This jar contains bloodthirsty medicinal worms useful for curing many maladies. You can expend one use of this jar during a short rest to administer leeches to yourself or a willing creature. A creature that has leeches administered to them cannot regain hit points during this short rest due to blood loss, but it may repeat a saving throw to remove the poisoned condition or a blood-borne disease (DC equal to the original effect).  
Alternatively, as an action you can throw this jar up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the jar as an improvised weapon. On a hit, if the target is a Large or smaller creature it takes 1d4 ongoing damage. A creature can end this damage by using its action to remove the leeches.  
**Laudanum**. This mixture of ambergris, saffron, and other rare ingredients can calm the nerves and ease mental pain. Once between long rests, when you drink the bitter reddish-brown concoction in this vial, you recover a level of strife. Roll 1d10. On a 1, you gain a short-term mental stress effect.  
**Lavender Paste.** Mixing lavender petals with herbs creates a natural insect repellent. You can use an action to apply the paste to yourself or a willing creature, granting immunity to insect-based hazards in swampy terrain. In addition, the creature gains benefits equivalent to mosquito netting for the next 24 hours.  
**Medicinal Salve.** Made from herbal ingredients, this soothing salve can help mend grievous injuries. You can apply medicinal salve to your wounds or the wounds of a willing creature during a short rest. Once between long rests, a creature treated with medicinal salve rolls a bonus Hit Die and adds the result to the total number of hit points regained during the short rest. (If a creature has multiple types of Hit Dice, use the largest.) When used in combination with a bandage, the bonus Hit Die granted by medicinal salve restores the maximum number of hit points.  
**Pressed Spiderbulb.** Consuming this dried flower grants you energy and tightens your reflexes, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Dexterity saving throws for 1 hour.  
**Sycamore Petal Poultice.** Consumption of these pulped petals heightens your senses, and after you eat it you gain an expertise die on Wisdom saving throws for 1 hour.

## Spellcasting Foci

Many spellcasters rely on a magical focus, an item that allows them to channel their power. Using a spellcasting focus allows a spellcaster to forgo many material components for their spells. A wide variety of items can be turned into magical foci, which fall into three primary categories:

* **Arcane Focus:** These foci are soaked in arcane power and often engraved or painted with eldritch symbols and cosmic iconography. Orbs, crystals, grimoires, staves, or wands are often used as spellcasting foci by sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards.  
* **Divine Focus:** These foci (often called holy symbols) are representations of a deity, pantheon, or ideal. They usually depict the crest or icon of a specific god or are of symbolic importance to a particular faith. Reliquaries, censers, amulets, emblems, or tattoos are often used as spellcasting foci by clerics and heralds.  
* **Nature Focus:** These foci typically incorporate furs, feathers, living plants, sacred wood, or the bones or teeth of sacred animals. Staves, wands, wonders, fetishes, or totems are typically used as spellcasting foci by druids and rangers.

**Focus Tattoo**. Some spellcasters permanently mark their bodies with symbols of their deity, eldritch runes, or ritualistic symbols. You can apply a focus tattoo over the course of a long rest, after which it functions as a spellcasting focus. Focus tattoos draw on a bearer’s own magics and must be attuned like a magic item in order to function. Focus tattoos require an attunement slot. When you cast spells with a focus tattoo in this way, you must briefly touch your focus tattoo with your free hand.  
**Grimoire**. These large and imposing tomes can function both as a spellbook and as a spellcasting focus.  
**Staff**. In addition to its use as a spellcasting focus, a staff can also be used as a quarterstaff.  
**Wonder**. A wonder is an unusual spellcasting focus such as a sacred flower that never wilts, a prismatic crystalized skull, or a polished burl that whispers with the language of the trees. If you lose a wonder, you can replace it as a ritual that takes 10 minutes and requires 5 gp worth of rare materials. You must be able to cast ritual spells to restore a lost wonder in this way. When you do so, any previous wonders created this way are destroyed.

## Common Poisons

While some poisons require exotic or expensive ingredients, many effective concoctions can be obtained or made with little effort. The following poisons might be commonly available from apothecaries and herbalists, at the Narrator’s discretion.  
Applying a poison takes an action. A creature immune to the poisoned condition is immune to any effects from poisons.  
**Curare**. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.  
**Ether**. You can use the chemicals in this flask to soak a rag or other small cloth item. An open flask of ether or an ether-soaked rag retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with it. While you are grappling a creature, you can use the ether to make a special melee weapon attack against that creature. On a hit, the creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. The creature remains unconscious for 1 minute, until it takes damage, or until another creature uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.  
**Poison**. You can use the poison in these vials to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to three pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition.  
*Basic:* When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn.  
*Advanced:* When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

## Survival Gear

The following items are necessities when facing inhospitable environments and harsh journeys:  
**Bedroll**. This essential commodity provides insulation and comfortable sleep on rocky, wet, or uneven terrain.  
**Blanket**. Provides warmth while resting in cold environments.  
**Climbing Gear**. A set of climbing gear includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climbing gear as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the anchor point, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.  
**Cold Weather Gear**. Cold weather gear includes special boots, gloves, warm padding, and face protection. This gear can be worn over or under any armor and takes 5 minutes to don or remove. While wearing cold weather gear, you automatically succeed on saving throws against effects caused by an environment of extreme cold, but you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects from environments of extreme heat and spells or effects that deal fire damage. This gear can also be worn to provide warmth while resting in cold environments.  
**Compass**. This device has a free-turning needle that always points towards the magnetic north.  
**Fishing Trap**. Whenever you retrieve this arrangement of netting, wires, and weights from a body of water with aquatic life, roll a d20 and add a bonus equal to the number of hours the trap has been set. On a 21 or higher, the trap has captured fish or other aquatic animals totaling 1d4 Supply.  
**Hunting Snare**. This simple arrangement of stakes, wires, and ropes can be set for catching small game in woodlands, forests, or other hunting grounds. Whenever you retrieve the snare, roll a d20 and add a bonus equal to the number of hours the snare has been set. On a 21 or higher, the snare has captured and killed a Tiny game animal totaling 1d4 Supply.  
**Hunting Trap**. ou can set a hunting trap as an action by affixing its chain to an immovable object. If a creature steps on the trap, it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d4 piercing damage and stops moving. Until it escapes, the creature's movement is limited to the length of the trap's chain, which is usually 3 feet long. Freeing the trapped creature requires a DC 13 Strength check. On a failed check, the trapped creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. Hunting traps of higher quality are more complex and effective, increasing the DC of each saving throw and ability check (by 2 for fine hunting traps, or by 4 for masterwork hunting traps).  
**Map.** When using a map, you can travel at a fast pace without taking a penalty to your passive Perception while within the area the map depicts. If you use a compass in conjunction with a map, you gain an expertise die on checks made to avoid becoming lost.  
*Local:* This map depicts an area that is well known to its makers and includes the names of hamlets, villages, and towns, as well as roads, waterways, and other routes through the realm.  
*Distant:* This map depicts a region far-flung from those that made it. It depicts only the major geographical features and best-known routes within the realm.  
*Frontier:* This map depicts an area only recently explored by those that made it, and the information is often incorrect or incomplete. When consulting this map, the Narrator secretly rolls a d20. On a result of 5 or less, the outdated or false information wastes travel time, as those using the map only progress half as much distance towards their destination.  
**Marshland Gear**. Marshland gear includes special boots, gloves, and clothes designed to repel moisture and muck. This gear can be worn over light armor and takes 5 minutes to don or remove. While you are wearing marshland gear, you can move at a normal pace through nonmagical swamps and marshes, but you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws made on dry or rocky terrain.  
**Mosquito Netting**. This thin mesh cloth offers protection from small insects while sleeping in jungles, swamps, or similar environments.  
**Rations**. Rations can vary wildly depending on the culture, but they usually consist of a day’s worth of water and dry foods suitable for extended travel, such as jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, or nuts. One unit of rations provides 1 Supply.  
**Tent.** These stitched-together canvases, hides, or tarps offer protection from the elements so long as there is a flat space where they can be deployed.  
*One Person:* Suitable for a Medium-sized creature. Occupies a 5-foot by 10-foot space when set up.  
*Two Person:* Suitable for up to 2 Medium-sized creatures. Occupies a 10-foot by 10-foot space when set up.  
*Communal:* Suitable for up to 6 Medium-sized creatures. Occupies a 15-foot by 15-foot space when set up.  
**Torch**. Once lit, a torch sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. A torch burns for 1 hour. When you use a burning torch as a club to make a melee attack, it deals an extra 1 fire damage on a hit.  
**Torch (Alchemical)**. The rough, sticky tar at the end of this torch burns through even the most adverse conditions. An alchemical torch burns for 1 hour even in heavy rains, strong winds, and underwater (albeit poorly when submerged, shedding only dim light in a 5-foot radius). Dimmer than a normal torch, it sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

## Containers

Table: Containers details the most common types of containers, though many adventurers get by with just a backpack and a waterskin.

## Miscellaneous Adventuring Gear

The many essentials that make adventuring into the unknown possible include:  
**Acid**. You can use an action to splash the contents of this vial onto a target within 5 feet of you, or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 ongoing acid damage. This damage persists for 3 rounds. A creature ends all ongoing damage from mundane acid by using its action to wipe away the liquid.  
**Alchemist’s Fire**. This liquid ignites in air. You can use an action to throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against a target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 ongoing fire damage. This damage persists for 1 minute. A creature can end all ongoing damage being dealt by alchemist’s fire by using its action to either make a DC 14 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames or by dousing the target with at least 1 gallon of water.  
**Ball Bearings**. You can use an action to spill these metal spheres over a level, 10-foot square area. A creature moving through the area at greater than half speed must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failure.  
***Black Powder Charge**.* A pound of black powder inside a wooden shell with a fuse can make a simple but potent explosive. You can use an action to set and light one or more black powder charges, which explode at the start of your next turn. A creature or object within 10 feet of an exploding charge must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage and 1d6 fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Increase the explosion’s damage by 1d6 force and 1d6 fire for each doubling of the number of charges set beyond the first. For example, 4 black powder charges deal 3d6 force and 3d6 fire damage, 8 black powder charges deal 4d6 force and 4d6 fire damage, 32 black powder charges deal 6d6 force damage and 6d6 fire damage, and so on.  
Multiple charges increase the area of the explosion, as follows: 2 charges—20-foot radius, 4 charges—30-foot radius, 8 charges—40-foot radius, 16 charges—50-foot radius, 32 charges—60-foot radius.  
Black powder charges become useless and are destroyed when submerged in water or left exposed to rain.  
**Block and Tackle**. This is a set of pulleys attached to a hook, upon which heavy objects can be attached. Along with a length of rope, a block and tackle allows a creature to lift a weight four times heavier than they normally could.  
**Book**. A book might contain fiction, illustrations, or information about any subject. (Spellbooks contain magical spells and are described later.) A book of masterwork quality covers one subject in detail. You gain an expertise die on checks made regarding the specialty detailed in the last masterwork book you’ve read.  
***Cage.*** This metal cage can contain a creature of the size it is designed to hold. The cage has a simple door held with a latch that requires an Intelligence score of 5 or higher to open.  
*Medium:* The cage (AC 16, 25 hit points) can be burst open with a DC 22 Strength check.  
*Large:* The cage (AC 17, 40 hit points) can be burst open with a DC 24 Strength check.  
*Huge:* The cage (AC 18, 55 hit points) can be burst open with a DC 26 Strength check.  
**Caltrops**. You can use an action to spread these spikes over a level, 5-foot-square area. A creature that moves through the area at greater than half speed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or it stops moving this turn and takes 1d4 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s Speed by 10 feet until it regains at least 1 hit point.   
**Candle**. A lit candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. It burns for 1 hour.  
**Chain**. A chain (AC 16, 10 hit points) can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check.  
**Clothes (Any)**. Clothes of varying styles can be appropriate to any number of cultures or social situations and can be worn over light armor. A DC 14 Perception check is required to notice light armor hidden underneath clothes.  
**Component Pouch**. A component pouch is a belt pouch containing those spellcasting material components that don’t have an explicit cost.  
**Crowbar**. You have advantage on Strength checks made to force open doors and similar objects when you apply leverage with this hooked metal bar.  
**Eyepatch**. Eyepatches can be used to prepare one eye for lower-light conditions, such as when moving between the deck and relative darkness of a ship’s hold. When you are wearing an eyepatch and enter an area of darkness or dim light from a brightly lit area, you can use a bonus action to swap the patch from one eye to the other to gain an expertise die on Perception checks for the next 10 minutes or until you enter an area of bright light.  
**Fishing Tackle**. Fishing tackle typically includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.  
**Flash Bomb**. You can use an action to throw this glass bauble, making a ranged improvised weapon attack against a creature within 20 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or becomes blinded until the end of your next turn.  
**Holy Water**. You can use an action to splash the contents of this flask on a creature within 5 feet of you, or throw the flask up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against a creature. On a hit, a fiend or undead takes 2d6 radiant damage and becomes slowed until the end of your next turn.  
A cleric or herald can create holy water by performing a 1-hour ritual that costs 1 25 gp and the expenditure of a 1st-level spell slot.  
**Hook Hand**. Prosthetic hook hands are common replacements for missing hands. You cannot gain advantage or expertise dice on Sleight of Hand checks made with a hook hand. A hook is a natural weapon that you can use to make unarmed strikes, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d6 \+ your Strength modifier.  
**Lantern**. A lantern can burn for 6 hours on a pint flask of oil.  
*Standard:* Casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.  
*Bullseye:* Casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.  
*Hooded:* Casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can use an action to lower the hood, causing the lantern to instead cast dim light in a 5-foot radius.  
**Lock**. A creature without the lock’s key (included in the price) can pick the lock with a DC 15 thieves’ tools check. At the Narrator’s discretion, better, more expensive locks may exist.  
**Magnifying Glass**. When you use a magnifying glass, you gain an expertise die on ability checks to inspect an item that is Tiny or highly detailed. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires 5 minutes, tinder, and sunlight or similar light.  
**Manacles**. These metal cuffs (AC 16, 20 hit points) can restrain a Small or Medium creature. As an action, you can use the manacles to restrain an unwilling creature, which must either be restrained or both grappled and prone. Escaping the manacles requires a DC 20 Dexterity check, and breaking them requires a DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature can pick the lock with a DC 15 thieves’ tools check.  
**Merchant’s Scale**. This balance scale measures the exact weight of Tiny objects.  
**Mess Tin**. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan while the other is used as a plate or shallow bowl.  
**Oil**. You can use an action to throw a 1-pint flask of oil up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target is soaked in oil. The next time the creature takes fire damage in the next minute, it takes an extra 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on a level, 5-foot-square area and set it alight. The oil burns for 2 rounds, dealing 5 fire damage to a creature the first time on a turn that it enters the area or ends its turn there.  
**Paint Pot**. This small clay pot contains a pint of a single color of paint, enough to cover about 50 square feet. As an action, you can throw the paint pot up to 20 feet, shattering it. Make a ranged improvised weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target is covered in bright paint. Removing the paint requires at least 1 minute of vigorous scrubbing. While covered in paint, a creature has disadvantage on Stealth checks.  
**Portable Ram**. While using a portable ram, you gain a \+4 bonus on Strength checks made to break down doors. When another creature helps you use the ram, you gain an expertise die (as well as advantage, as normal).  
**Prosthetic**. Prosthetics are usually metal and custom made to replace whatever portion of a limb has been lost.  
*Arm or Hand:* You cannot gain advantage or expertise dice on Sleight of Hand checks made with this prosthetic. However, you can use the prosthetic defensively, treating it as a hands-free light shield when not holding a weapon or object in that hand.  
*Leg or Foot:* While you are standing on your prosthetic, you cannot gain advantage or expertise dice on saving throws made to resist being knocked prone, but you take half damage from caltrops, spikes, and difficult terrain that deals damage. Depending on how your prosthetic is constructed, you can use it to store up to one concealed Tiny item (DC 15 Investigation or Perception check to notice).  
**Rope**. Hemp or silk rope has an AC of 10, 2 hit points, and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.  
**Smoke Bomb**. This metal sphere’s casing is pockmarked with holes and capped with a thick fuse. As an action, you can light the bomb’s fuse and throw the bomb up to 20 feet. While lit, the bomb spews suffocating black smoke that heavily obscures a 10-foot cube for 1 minute. An air-breathing creature that starts its turn within the smoke must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage until it leaves the area. A wind of at least moderate speed suppresses the smoke effect for 1 round.  
**Spellbook**. A spellbook is a 100-page book in which wizards scribe their spells.  
**Spyglass**. Anything viewed through a spyglass appears to be twice its normal size. You can use a spyglass to make Perception checks to observe areas you can see that are more than a quarter mile away.  
**Tanglefoot Bag*.*** Unguents and adhesives fill this airtight sack. You can use an action to throw this bag, making a ranged improvised weapon attack at a target within 20 feet. On a hit, rapidly hardening sap covers the target. and it makes a DC 13 Strength check or becomes grappled. At the start of each of its turns, the target repeats the check, ending the effect on itself on a success. The sap can also be destroyed (AC 13, 6 hit points).  
**Tinderbox**. This box holds everything needed to start a fire, including flint, fire steel, and tinder. You can use a tinderbox to ignite wood in 1 minute, or a torch, paper, tinder, or other very flammable object in one action.   
**Travel Enclosure**. This fine, wire-mesh bag is reinforced with metal beams, making a durable but flexible enclosure. Creatures of an appropriate size can comfortably reside within the enclosure if provided with some appropriate substrate (soft bedding for rodents, loamy soil for toads, and so on).  
*Tiny:* A single Tiny creature residing within the enclosure has total cover while inside it and automatically succeeds on saving throws to resist area effects.  
*Small:* Up to 3 Tiny creatures or a single Small creature residing with the enclosure have total cover while inside it and automatically succeed on saving throws to resist area effects.  
**Unstable Arcanum (Vial)**. This small vial of unstable magical waste can make for a powerful explosive. You can set and light one or more vials of unstable arcanum as an action, causing each to explode at the start of your next turn. A creature or object within 10 feet of the exploding vial must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 force damage on a failure or half damage on a success. Increase this damage by 2d10 for each vial set beyond the first. Whenever a creature carrying unstable arcanum takes damage from a spell or cantrip, it must roll a d4. On a result of a 1, the unstable arcanum instantly explodes as if set and lit.  
**Wheelchair**. This durable device provides tactical mobility without requiring use of the legs. While mounted on a wheelchair you are considered to be wearing the wheelchair as a piece of gear. The wheelchair is mechanically complex and can ascend stairs and ramps slowly, or provide a boost of speed on the descent. You have a movement speed of 30 feet while mounted on a wheelchair. You treat inclines and stairs as difficult terrain, but while moving down slopes, stairs, or other significant declines you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. At the Narrator’s discretion, more advanced and tactical wheelchairs may be available.

***Bulky.*** A bulky item weighs 40 pounds or more (for example a bag with 2,000 or more gold coins) or is greater than 4 feet in any dimension (like a large ornate rug). A creature can carry one bulky item, plus additional bulky items equal to its Strength modifier (minimum 1). When a creature is not carrying any Supply, it can carry one additional bulky item.  
***Carrying Things.*** A Medium-sized creature’s carrying capacity equals its Strength score × 15 pounds. Aside from its gear, a Medium-sized creature can carry Supply equal to its Strength score.

## Tools

Many trades and crafts require special tools to do things like pick a lock, paint a portrait, or brew a potion.  
Any character can use a tool kit, but many characters also gain proficiency with specific tools. When you are proficient, you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks made with that tool.  
Tool use does not depend on any single ability score, and your Narrator may decide your work might require any sort of ability check.  
**Masterwork Tools*.*** When using tools of masterwork quality that you are proficient with, you gain an expertise die on checks made with them.

### 

### Trade Tools

Trade tools are divided into artisan’s tools, gaming sets, and musical instruments.  
**Artisan’s Tools.** These tools allow you to turn a specific type of raw material into generic trade goods using your time, effort, and skill. The type of tool determines the materials and amount of time needed. After spending the needed time and materials, you make a profession check with those tools, which determines the value of the resulting generic trade goods (on a result of 15 or lower, the materials used are wasted).  
**Gaming Sets**. These items can be played to simply pass the time or to win money through gambling. Gambling can potentially earn or lose money, depending on the amount you wager and the outcome of your check. You can also attempt to cheat opponents by making a Sleight of Hand check contested by the highest Perception check among observers. On a success, you gain advantage on your ability check using the gaming set, but on a failure your opponents might turn hostile. Not all opponents can cover all wagers, and most refuse to wager for more than a quarter of their net worth. For each hour spent gambling, make a check using your tool set and consult Table: Gambling Outcomes (though in most situations, there’s only so much money to be won, and usually a few sore losers when the house is cleaned out).  
**Musical Instrument.** Examples of some common types of musical instruments are found on Table: Musical Instruments, but any instrument can be played for coin. Doing so requires a public space with at least 10 people, or an official gig at an establishment with a musical venue, like a tavern or club. In either case, make a check using your instrument for each hour you spend performing, then consult Table: Performance Outcomes to determine the amount of gold you receive, though you may earn more or less at specific musical venues at the Narrator’s discretion. Bards can also use musical instruments as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

### Miscellaneous Tools

The following tools allow you to perform specific actions or have very specific uses.  
**Disguise Kit.** A creature observing you after you make a disguise kit check must make a Perception check against a DC equal to the result of your disguise kit check in order to see through your disguise.  
**Forgery Kit.** A creature examining a false document made using a forgery kit must make an Investigation check against a DC equal to the result of your forgery kit check in order to realize it is a fake.  
**Herbalism Kit.** This kit contains the tools needed to carefully harvest and process rare herbs into remedies. You can attempt to harvest rare herbs from areas with abundant flora by spending an hour searching and making an herbalism kit check. You randomly obtain one of the following medicinals on a result of 16–22: adderwort roots, dried yewclaw bark, fairy cap, ironwood acorn, pressed spiderbulb, sycamore petal poultice. On a result of 23–27, you instead obtain one rare herb, and on a result of 28 or higher you obtain 2 rare herbs. With 1 minute of preparation a rare herb can be quickly processed into a *basic healing potion*, 2 rare herbs can be made into an antitoxin, and 3 rare herbs can be made into a *greater healing potion*.  
**Navigator’s Tools.** These precision instruments allow you to relate your position to the position of the stars. So long as you are on the Material Plane and can freely observe the stars, once per night you can make a navigator’s tools check. On a result of 15–19, you learn one of the following pieces of information, or two pieces of information on a result of 20 or higher:

* The approximate time of year.  
* Your approximate distance from the equator (assuming the world has a known axis).  
* Your approximate distance from the place you last made this check.  
* Your current distance from a major landmark and the approximate amount of time it will take to reach it.

***Poisoner’s Kit.*** Everything necessary for carefully harvesting and processing natural poisons and venoms can be found in this kit. You can attempt to harvest poisons from areas with abundant flora by spending an hour searching and making a poisoner’s kit check. On a result of 1–14, you accidentally poison yourself and suffer the effects of a basic poison. On a result of 15–19, you obtain a vial’s worth of basic poison. On a result of 20–24, you obtain a vial’s worth of advanced poison, and on a result of 25 or higher you obtain a vial’s worth of potent poison.  
Alternatively, with 10 minutes of work you can use a poisoner’s kit to harvest poison from the fresh corpse of a creature that naturally contained poisons. Make a poisoner’s kit check against a DC equal to the DC of the creature’s poison (if the creature’s poison has no saving throw, use 8 \+ the creature’s CR). On a failed check, you suffer the effects of the creature’s poison, and on a success you harvest a vial’s worth of poison. As an action, you can use the creature’s poison to coat one slashing or piercing weapon, or up to 3 pieces of ammunition. The poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. Weapons or ammunition you coat in a creature’s poison inflict the same effects as shown in the creature’s statistics. Once you harvest poison from a creature, that corpse cannot be harvested again.  
**Sewing Kit.** This kit of threads, thimbles, buttons, and scissors is primarily used to mend clothing. With 1 hour of work you can use a sewing kit to mend clothing and some suits of armor. The DC of a sewing kit check is determined by the material being worked (as shown on Table: Materials).  
**Smith’s Tools.** These hammers and clamps are a poor replacement for a full forge but can be instrumental for repairing metal items. With 1 hour of work you can use smith’s tools to mend many weapons and armors. The DC of a smith’s tools check is determined by the material being worked (as shown on Table: Materials).  
**Thieves’ Tools**. This set of often sharp and slender metal instruments are needed to crack locks and carefully spy into mechanisms. You can use an action to open a lock by making a thieves’ tools check against a DC determined by the quality of the lock being picked.

## Mounts

This section concerns the cost, upkeep, and carrying utility of your mounts.  
In order to be used as a mount, a creature must be at least one size category larger than you, and must have an Intelligence score of 4 or lower. You may be able to convince creatures with a higher Intelligence score to let you ride them, but they are considered independent creatures (not mounts).  
You can use a mount as a pack animal instead of riding it. A pack animal can carry a number of Supply based on its size (see Tracking Supplies) in addition to its normal carrying capacity, and it can carry a number of bulky items equal to its Strength modifier \+ 1\. If you intend to ride a mount as well as carry items with it, it can only carry half as many Supply and bulky items.  
Many beasts commonly used as pack animals and mounts are especially adept at carrying heavy loads, and animals such as horses and mules have a much higher carrying capacity than their Strength score would normally provide, as shown on Table: Mounts.  
Multiply a creature’s carrying capacity by 5 if that creature is pulling a drawn vehicle. Creatures can add their carrying capacities together when pulling the same vehicle.  
The mounts listed here are available for purchase in most fantasy worlds. Other mounts may be common in your setting or may be rare creatures awarded for the completion of a quest. Many large pets could also be used as mounts.

### Feed

Mounts are living creatures, and they need to eat. Thankfully, most common mounts are herbivorous animals able to feed themselves if allowed to graze in grassy areas for at least 1 hour each day. Other mounts—especially carnivorous ones—may not be so easy to feed. Carnivorous mounts and herbivorous mounts without grazing areas must be fed Supply each day, or else they suffer fatigue just like characters. Medium mounts require 1 Supply each day, Large mounts require 2 Supply each day, and mounts that are Huge size or larger require an amount of Supply determined by the Narrator.  
If using the **casual supplies** rules, mounts are assumed to either feed themselves or carry enough feed to last any journey.  
If using the **desperate supplies** rules, feed for mounts must be tracked separately. Throughout the course of a day, Large-sized mounts must consume at least 4 pounds of food and 4 gallons (32 pounds) of water. Huge-sized mounts must consume at least 16 pounds of food and 16 gallons (128 pounds) of water. When a mount finishes a long rest without having consumed its required food and water, it gains a level of fatigue.

### Mount Traits

Every mount is different. For each mount, there is a chance of it having a special trait. Roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, roll 1d20 on the following table.

1. **Fleet.** The mount is unusually fast. Increase its Speed by 5 feet.  
2. **Loyal.** The mount always comes to you when called or whistled for.  
3. **Aggressive.** Increase the mount’s attack bonuses by 1\.  
4. **Skittish.** The first time each encounter the mount or its rider is attacked, roll 1d6. On a 1, the mount panics and flees in a random direction for 1 round.  
5. **Proud.** The mount will carry its rider but refuses to carry bags.  
6. **Kicks.** Unless it is being ridden, the mount attacks anyone that wanders close to it.  
7. **Protective.** Once per long rest, the mount will take a hit for its rider.  
8. **Dislikes barding.** The mount refuses to wear barding of any kind.  
9. **Bestial.** The mount is unusually bestial looking. The rider gains an expertise die on Intimidation checks.  
10. **Unusual color.** The mount is an unusual color for its species, making it somewhat unique.  
11. **Placid.** The mount is usually docile and friendly, and will not attack foes.  
12. **Devil-touched.** The mount has some devilish blood, given away by its red eyes. It has resistance to fire damage.  
13. **Vertigo.** The mount is afraid of heights. Taking the mount across high places (like a ledge with a 10-foot drop below it) requires coaxing with a DC 10 Animal Handling check.  
14. **Fey-touched.** The mount has some fey blood. It and its rider have advantage on saving throws against enchantment spells.  
15. **Greedy.** The mount chows down on unattended food, and requires double the normal Supply.  
16. **Fearful.** The mount is afraid of fire and will not move within 10 feet of it without a DC 10 Animal Handling check.  
17. **Willing.** The mount is eager to please, and lowers itself to assist when being mounted. Mounting this mount is a free action.  
18. **Jump-shy.** The mount will not attempt jumps of any kind.  
19. **Spirited.** The mount and its rider gain \+1 to initiative checks.  
20. **Protective.** The mount can stand watch and alert the party if it detects approaching creatures.

## Mount Gear

The following items are associated with keeping proper care of a mount.  
**Barding**. Barding is armor built for an animal. When purchasing barding, refer to Table: Armor but multiply the cost of the armor by 4 and the weight by 2\.  
**Saddles**. Saddles make for an easier ride and help prevent the rider from falling off. While using a saddle, you gain an expertise die on any check made to remain mounted. Saddles for particularly unusual creatures are more expensive and cost 5 times the price of a regular saddle.  
**Saddlebags**. Saddlebags allow you to pack items onto a creature beside the saddle. A mount can’t carry Supply or bulky items without saddlebags.  
**Stabling**. In a city, your mount will need lodging just like you do. The cost found on Table: Mount Gear is the average cost to house and feed a Large or smaller mount for 24 hours at most stables. Particularly exotic or larger mounts may cost more to stable.

**TABLE: MOUNT GEAR**

| ITEM | COST | WEIGHT |
| :---- | :---: | :---: |
| Barding | ×4 | ×2 |
| Saddle | 10 gp (50 gp for exotic saddles) | 25 lbs. |
| Saddlebags | 4 gp | 8 lbs. |
| Stabling (per day) | 5 sp (2 gp for Huge mounts) | — |

## Vehicles

All vehicles have the following properties:

* **Terrain:** Vehicles fall into three terrain categories: land vehicles, water vehicles, and air vehicles. Vehicles travel in the terrain of their category. Proficiency with a category of vehicles allows a creature to add its proficiency bonus to checks made with that type of vehicle.  
* **Size and Armor Class:** Just like creatures, vehicles have size categories, and each has an AC that determines how difficult it is to hit with attacks.  
* **Hit Points:** A vehicle is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. In addition, when a vehicle is reduced to 50 percent of its hit point maximum, it suffers a malfunction and must roll on Table: Malfunction.  
* **Speed:** Vehicles are listed with their movement speed, as well as their journey speed for traveling long distances.  
* **Crew:** Many vehicles only need a single creature as a driver, but larger vehicles often require dozens of people to properly operate. Drivers cannot perform actions using a vehicle unless the minimum crew requirement is met.  
* **Immunities:** As objects, vehicles are immune to poison and psychic damage. They are also immune to the blinded, charmed, confused, deafened, fatigued, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, slowed, strife, stunned, and unconscious conditions, as well as any other effect that would result from failing a Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throw.  
* **Havens:** A vehicle acts as a haven if it provides accommodation and shelter from the elements. At the Narrator’s discretion, the environment may not be suitable for it to act as a haven.

Unlike creatures, all vehicles have a “front.” In many situations this facing dictates the way the vehicle moves.  
In order to move, all vehicles require a driver. While at the steering (such as the reins of a wagon or the wheel of a ship) a creature can use a bonus action to make the vehicle perform one of the following actions:

* **Drive:** The vehicle moves half of its movement speed directly forward, then the driver may change the vehicle’s facing by up to 90 degrees (a full turn left or right) before moving up to the remaining movement speed. The vehicle gains momentum.  
* **Maneuver:** The vehicle moves half of its movement speed forward, and the driver may change the vehicle’s facing by up to 90 degrees (a full turn left or right) up to 2 times during this movement. This action cannot be performed while the vehicle has momentum.  
* **Ahead Full:** The vehicle moves one and a half times its movement speed directly forward. The vehicle gains momentum. If the vehicle would roll for a malfunction before it is used to take another action, it rolls twice on that table instead (reroll any duplicate results).  
* **Brake:** The vehicle moves half of its movement speed directly forward, then it loses momentum..

**Momentum.** At initiative count 20, all vehicles with momentum move half their movement speed directly forward. A vehicle’s momentum ends automatically after 1 minute if no actions are taken with it.  
**Saving Throws.** Unlike most objects, vehicles must make Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws as if they were creatures against effects that would call for them. All vehicles have a Strength and Constitution score based on their size (see below). A driven vehicle has a Dexterity score equal to its driver’s Dexterity score (a vehicle without a driver has a Dexterity of 0).

### 

### Size

The size of a vehicle determines many of a vehicle’s properties:  
**Strength, Constitution, and Carrying Capacity**. A vehicle’s Strength, Constitution, and carrying capacity are determined by its size.

* **Large:** A Large vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 14 (+2). It can carry up to 3 passengers along with the driver, up to 40 Supply, and up to 10 bulky items in addition to 2,000 pounds of carrying capacity.  
* **Huge:** A Huge vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 18 (+4). It can carry up to 6 passengers along with the driver, up to 80 Supply, and up to 20 bulky items in addition to 4,000 pounds of carrying capacity.  
* **Gargantuan:** A Gargantuan vehicle has a Strength and Constitution score of 22 (+6). It can carry a number of additional passengers equal to the minimum required crew, up to 800 Supply, and up to 200 bulky items in addition to 40,000 pounds of carrying capacity.

**Collisions**. If a vehicle has momentum and enters the space occupied by a creature or another object, a collision occurs. Both the vehicle and whatever it impacts take damage according to the vehicle’s size: Large—4d6 bludgeoning damage, Huge—8d6 bludgeoning damage, Gargantuan—12d6 bludgeoning damage.  
If the object or creature impacted is the same size as the vehicle or larger, the vehicle immediately stops and loses momentum. If the object or creature impacted is smaller than the vehicle, it is shunted into the nearest unoccupied space that allows the vehicle to complete its movement unimpeded.

### Malfunctions

When a vehicle is reduced to half its hit point maximum, roll 1d6 on Table: Malfunctions to determine what aspect of the vehicle breaks. Vehicle malfunctions are usually too extreme to repair quickly except by magical means. Malfunctions remain until the vehicle is restored to its hit point maximum.

**TABLE: MALFUNCTIONS**

| D6 | MALFUNCTION |
| :---: | :---- |
| 1 | **Movement.** Movement has been compromised, such as losing the sails, losing the animal team drawing the vehicle, or destroying an engine. The Drive, Maneuver, and Ahead Full actions cannot be taken until it is repaired. |
| 2 | **Integrity.** Some key component holding everything together has been lost and the vehicle immediately loses an additional 25 percent of its hit point maximum. |
| 3 | **Brakes.** The ability to stop has been lost. The Brake and Stop actions cannot be taken until repaired. |
| 4 | **Steering.** The driver’s ability to fully control the vehicle has been compromised. The Drive and Maneuver actions cannot be taken until repaired. |
| 5 | **Cargo.** Half of any Supply currently carried by the vehicle are destroyed. |
| 6 | **Superficial.** The damage looks bad but doesn’t cause any further issues. |

### Special Features

Vehicles may possess any number of fantastical features, but the following are the most common:  
**Armed**. Armed vehicles have one or more weapons in place on board (see Table: Siege Weaponry). A creature can use an action to fire or reload a siege weapon.  
**Drawn**. A drawn vehicle is pulled by one or more beasts of burden and its movement and travel speeds are determined by the animal (or animals) pulling it.  
**Personal**. Personal vehicles are designed for a single occupant and usually have far less space. Vehicles with this property can only ever carry a maximum of one person and have one-fourth the carrying capacity of a normal vehicle of the same size.  
**Three-dimensional**. Usually found on airships, a three-dimensional vehicle may also turn up or down when making turns.  
**Transport**. Transport vehicles are designed for cargo and crew, and have twice the carrying capacity and maximum number of passengers as normal for a vehicle of the same size.

### Repairing Vehicles

Repairing damaged or malfunctioning vehicles requires a tool check against the DC listed for the vehicle’s primary material, as shown on the Materials table. During a long rest you can make one check, ending any malfunctions it currently has on a success and restoring hit points equal to the result of your check. Alternatively you can hire someone to repair your vehicle for you (which is an automatic success and typically costs one-fifth of the vehicle’s total cost)

## Lifestyle Expenses

There are three general categories of lifestyle: poor, moderate, and rich.  
**Poor.** Dining and lodging in poor social circles is useful when seeking out underworld contacts, fences, and assassins. A poor lifestyle imposes a –1 Prestige penalty (to a minimum of 0).  
**Moderate.** Dining and lodging in moderate social circles is useful when seeking out professionals in legitimate services, guild members, and specialists.  
**Rich.** Dining and lodging in rich social circles is useful when seeking out nobility, heads of state, royalty, or any leader or high-ranking member of a major organization. A rich lifestyle grants a \+1 Prestige bonus.

# Spending Gold

The following sections provide three distinct ways to spend gold: shopping for material items, seeking out NPC services, and donating funds for city projects or factions an adventurer may be involved with.

## Shopping

There are three primary types of establishments where an adventurer may purchase goods: adventuring outfitters, magic item suppliers, and smithies.

### Adventuring Outfitters

In smaller settlements, these may be simple general stores with a limited stock. In larger settlements you are likely to find one or more well-stocked adventuring outfitters.

### Magic Item Suppliers

If you are in a large city or metropolis—or you find yourself in a world where magic is the norm—you may just be able to go shopping for magic items.  
Most magic item shops have a limited supply of uncommon and common magic items. Utility magic items are far more common in shops such as these. The Magic Items For Sale table gives you an idea of the typical stock of magic item suppliers.  
Magic item suppliers are also useful locations narratively, as they may be frequented by notable adventurers, politicians, healers, and villains. Additionally, these shops sometimes have spellcasters on their staff that can perform spellcasting services for a fee, as described in the next section.

### Smithies

Smithies are found in developed settlements of at least a few dozen people, with experienced smiths living in more populated areas. Here, adventurers can purchase any simple weapon. At the Narrator’s discretion, you might find martial weapons and regionally specific weapons when applicable. Smithies also have a selection of medium and heavy armors. Light armor can be found at a leatherworker’s shop.  
Smithies can also take custom orders. See the pricing guide for crafting items below for more details.

### NPC Services

Listed below are descriptions of various services NPCs can provide throughout your adventures, as well as their associated fees. 

### Ordering Crafted Items

To determine the cost of having an item crafted, you must add the cost of materials and the crafter’s fee to the standard price for the item, although when rare materials are involved you may have to provide them instead of just paying for them. At the Narrator’s discretion, the crafter’s fee may vary slightly based upon the crafter’s experience, settlement population, or some other variable. Refer to the Crafting Prices table to find the standard prices for crafter’s and materials fees. Use the storefront column to determine what kind of storefront said crafter is usually found in.

**TABLE: CRAFTING PRICES**

| ITEM TYPE | CRAFTER’S FEE | STOREFRONT |
| :---- | :---: | :---- |
| Common or uncommon potion | 5% | Apothecary, magic item supplier |
| Rare potion | 10% | Apothecary, magic item supplier |
| Wondrous item | 10% | Magic item supplier |
| Ammunition | 5% | Smithy |
| Simple weapon | 5% | Smithy |
| Martial weapon | 10% | Smithy |
| Light armor | 5% | Leatherworker |
| Medium armor | 5% | Smithy |
| Heavy armor | 10% | Smithy |

### Spellcasting

Powerful mages who advertise their services are only likely to be found in a magical metropolis.  
Refer to the Spellcasting Services table for a list of commonly performed spells and associated prices.

### 

### Renting a Demiplane

Occasionally you might find an eccentric wizard advertising the rental of a demiplane. These pocket dimensions are incredibly customizable and highly sought after.  
Most starting rates for such spaces are 1,200 gp per tenday or 3,000 gp per month.

## Donations

An adventurer may be moved to donate to charity or invest to the betterment of a settlement. There are boons and rewards for sponsoring a city project or helping develop a charitable organization. In order to benefit from a donation, you must contribute at least 1,000 gp.

### Infrastructure Rewards

#### Stone Bridge (1,500 gp)

Donating the money for the bridge gives you the privilege of naming it. If it is a toll bridge, you never have to pay toll at this bridge or at any other toll in the settlement. Additionally, you gain advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with common citizens of the settlement.

#### Improved Sewer System (4,000 gp)

When you donate money for a new or improved sewer system you gain exclusive access to the sewer blueprints, and you can order secret tunnels to be made between the sewers and any three buildings in the city. For an extra 3,000 gp, a small underground facility can be built inside the sewers. This facility does not count towards the other three buildings that have tunnel access.

#### City Buildings (2,500 gp)

When you fund the construction of a civic building, such as a town hall or police facility, you never have to make an appointment to see a city official. Additionally, you gain advantage on Insight and Intimidation checks when interacting with city officials.

### Philanthropic Rewards

#### Public Library (3,000 gp)

When you fund the building of a public library, you gain advantage on Investigation checks made to research using the library, so long as relevant information can be found there. Additionally, you may ask the scholar in residence to perform a research project on a specific topic. The project typically takes one week. The usefulness of the information produced by this research is left to the Narrator’s discretion.

#### Hospital (4,000 gp)

When you contribute to the building of a hospital, you gain free treatment by the medical staff. Medical staff immediately work to stabilize any dying character, regardless of whether they donated to the hospital. Common diseases can be treated in a week’s time. Treatment of rarer diseases and ailments are left to the Narrator’s discretion, and hospitals cannot treat magical ailments.

#### Orphanage (2,500 gp)

Characters who contribute to the building of an orphanage gain the trust of the youngsters of the street. You have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence orphans from this settlement. At the Narrator’s discretion, the staff of the orphanage may provide you useful information, such as the names of local gangs recruiting orphans or the identities of an orphan’s parents.

#### School (3,000 gp)

Schools increase the likelihood of literacy amongst children, teenagers, and young adults in the town. Additionally, characters can recruit recent graduates of the settlement’s school as hirelings.

#### Community Botanical Garden (3,000 gp

A community garden gives the settlement access to plants used for medicinal and magical purposes—as well as good old-fashioned cooking. After you build a garden, you have access to herbs and plants required for spell components, the brewing of potions, and the crafting of magical items. Additionally, you receive a 10 percent discount on all potions and food sold in this settlement.

#### Animal Sanctuary (10,000 gp)

An animal sanctuary is a great investment for any adventuring party, especially those that include rangers and druids. Animal sanctuaries provide an opportunity to learn about animals that you may not interact with every day. These institutions sell their creatures only to those they know will care for them, and when you invest in the building of such a property, you receive a 50 percent discount on the animals found there.

## Pets

While most pets are likely to be acquired over the course of an adventure, there is always the possibility of finding places with animals and magical beasts for sale. Use the Pets tables to determine the price for your party’s new furry (or scaly) friend.

### Eggs

Some creatures are easier to train from birth, while others simply must be trained from birth, such as dragons. Refer to the Egg Prices table when you are looking to raise dragons and other undomesticated creatures. Note that none of these creatures can be acquired in a common market and are almost always handled by auction houses or the occasional private collector of eccentricities.

**STARTING WEALTH**

## Starting Gear Past First Level

When starting at a higher level, you can choose to spend your starting gold on the following equipment packages, organized by tier (tier 2: 5th–10th level, tier 3: 11th–16th level, tier 4: 17th–20th level).   
The higher-tier gear packages presented here are based on the starting gold of that tier’s lowest level (5th, 11th, and 17th level). When beginning at a level other than these, you subtract the value of the suggested starting packages from your starting gold for that level and gain the difference. Note that sometimes leftover gold from your tier’s suggested package is enough to also buy a lower-tier equipment package.

## Building a Stronghold

**TABLE: STRONGHOLD SIZE**

| GRADE | BUILDING AREA | RURAL AREA |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 100–1,000 square ft. (about 25 feet × 25 feet) | 1–5 acres |
| 2 | 1,001–5,000 square feet (about 50 feet × 50 feet) | 5–10 acres |
| 3 | 5,001–10,000 square feet (about 85 feet × 85 feet) | 11–20 acres |
| 4 | 10,001–25,000 square feet (about 130 feet × 130 feet) | 21–60 acres |
| 5 | 25,001–50,000 square feet (about 195 feet × 195 feet) | 61–120 acres |
| 6 | 50,001–100,000 square feet (about 275 feet × 275 feet) | 121–250 acres |
| 7 | 100,001–250,000 square feet (about 420 feet × 420 feet) | 251–600 acres |
| 8 | 250,001+ square feet (more than 500 feet × 500 feet) | 601+ acres |

A stronghold offers benefits that are designed to be equal or superior to the equivalent expenditure in arms and equipment.   
**Haven.** Unless the Narrator deems otherwise, you are always able to use your stronghold as a haven.

## Stronghold Types

Choose your stronghold’s type from the list of stronghold types: castle, encampment, farm, guildhouse, house, laboratory, library, menagerie, sacred grove, shop, tavern, temple, training hall, or workshop. The type of stronghold you choose defines the nature of the benefits it grants you.

## Size

Choose a size for your stronghold. A stronghold’s basic cost is **1 gp per square foot for a building**, or **500 gp per acre for a rural stronghold**. Strongholds of grade 7 and higher are usually out of the reach of most adventurers.  
The size is the overall “footprint” or total space occupied by your stronghold. You can choose how much of it is physical structures and how much is external grounds such as gardens and courtyards.  
**Buildings.** These strongholds are primarily structures, although they may include land. You decide how much of the space you’ve paid for is part of the building and how much is external grounds and gardens. When purchasing a building use the Building Area column of Table: Stronghold Size.  
**Rural.** Some strongholds  are not primarily based upon a structure. These strongholds tend to be larger than those based upon buildings, with expanses of open land. When purchasing a rural stronghold, use the Rural Area column of Table: Stronghold Size.  
Rural strongholds may include frugal structures such as barns or tents, and a single dwelling such as a farmhouse. These structures do not cost extra and are not considered sub-strongholds.

## Unusual Strongholds

**TABLE: UNUSUAL STRONGHOLDS**

| FEATURE | COST MULTIPLIER | MINIMUM COST |
| :---- | :---: | :---: |
| Disguised/hidden (like a thieves’ guild disguised as a legitimate business) | ×2 | — |
| Garrison | ×2 | — |
| Income | ×2 | — |
| Island | ×3 | 1,000 gp |
| Mountaintop | ×3 | 1,500 gp |
| Underground | ×3 | 2,000 gp |
| Underwater | ×5 | 4,000 gp |
| Floating in the air | ×10 | 20,000 gp |
| Wondrous materials (such as adamantine) | ×10 | 30,000 gp |
| Pocket dimension | ×50 | 35,000 gp |

Now that you have the basics of your stronghold, you can apply large multipliers to your stronghold cost in order to give it unusual traits. This modifier applies to the base cost of the stronghold, before you apply furnishings.  
**Minimum Cost.** Note that there is a minimum cost for certain features. If your stronghold total cost is less than this minimum cost, its price is increased to the minimum cost. The minimum cost is applied before multipliers for furnishings and staff.  
**Income.** Shops, taverns, and other businesses are assumed to break even, and neither generate income nor lose money. However, you may choose to have your stronghold generate an income. This is generally a long-term option, and the stronghold generates one-tenth its value every year. You may choose how frequently you collect this income.

## Furnishings and Staff

Features include furnishings, staff, security elements, and so on. Furnishings are easy to do—you simply decide how much you wish to spend from the Stronghold Furnishings and Staff table and multiply the cost of your stronghold by the amount shown for its total cost. This multiplier applies to the entire stronghold.  
**Selling Items**. You cannot simply sell off individual items—it’s all part of a general cost—but if you are in desperate need of money you can downgrade your stronghold’s furnishings and recover half the money you spent.  
**Staff**. Staff come with the stronghold and include all household workers and laborers, but not soldiers or special hirelings. The number of staff you have is determined by the quality of the stronghold you’ve chosen and its size (as per the Stronghold Furnishings and Staff table), rounding down (minimum 0). If you change the quality or size of your stronghold, your staff levels increase or decrease accordingly.  
There is no expectation that all of your staff will be on duty or on the property at a given time.  
**Garrison.** Choosing the garrison feature gives your stronghold a number of **soldiers** equal to half the stronghold’s staff level. For every 30 soldiers, you also gain one **veteran**, and for every 200 soldiers you gain one **knight**. At the Narrator’s discretion, other NPCs (or monsters) may be part of your garrison. A garrison is used to defend a stronghold and cannot be taken adventuring.

**TABLE: STRONGHOLD FURNISHINGS AND STAFF**

| QUALITY | COST MULTI-PLIER | STAFF BY STRONG- HOLD SIZE (STRUCTURE) | RURAL |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Frugal | ×1/2 | 1 per 1,000 square ft. | 1 per 5 acres |
| Average | — | 1 per 500 square ft. | 1 per 2 acres |
| Luxurious | ×2 | 1 per 100 square ft. | 1 per acre |
| Legendary | ×5 | 1 per 100 square ft. | 1 per acre |

## Combining Strongholds

You can combine multiple strongholds. You must pay the cost for both. A sub-stronghold must be half the size or smaller in square feet than the stronghold in which it is placed, and must be of the same quality.

## Multiple Strongholds

You can have as many strongholds as you’re able to buy, but you only ever truly call one of them home. When you gain an additional stronghold, you may immediately choose to make it your permanent stronghold. Otherwise it takes a week of staying in a stronghold for it to become your permanent stronghold. You only gain the benefits granted by your permanent stronghold (including any sub-strongholds within it).  
**Stronghold Ability Score Increase.** The only increase to an ability score you gain is from the first stronghold that grants this benefit. Changing your permanent stronghold or purchasing sub-strongholds does not alter your ability scores.  
**Prestige Bonus.** Your Prestige bonus is determined by your most expensive stronghold, and you do not gain additional Prestige from having additional strongholds.  
**Prestige Center.** When you change your stronghold, you may also choose to make it your Prestige Center, though if you are purchasing an already constructed building it takes a week to take effect, as stories of your arrival and deeds circulate about the region.

## Prestige and Increasing a Stronghold

The final value of your stronghold (including any sub-strongholds) determines the amount of additional Prestige you gain. The prestige bonus granted by your stronghold is shown in Table: Stronghold Prestige. The cost to increase your stronghold’s size later is modified by its furnishings and any other

cost multipliers.

**TABLE: STRONGHOLD PRESTIGE**

| COST | PRESTIGE BONUS |
| :---- | :---: |
| 101–1,000 gp | \+0 |
| 1,001–25,000 gp | \+1 |
| 25,001–50,000 gp | \+2 |
| 50,001–100,000 gp | \+3 |
| 100,001–250,000 gp | \+4 |
| 250,001+ gp | \+5 |

## Stronghold Types

There are many different types of strongholds, from small townhouses to mighty castles and mysterious wizard’s towers.  
**Free Followers.** Each type of stronghold grants its owner a stronghold feat, as well as additional followers. For every 100 staff you have, you gain 1 free follower. You may choose the type of free follower from the list associated with your stronghold type. Followers granted by your stronghold start at inexperienced, increasing to seasoned when you reach 9th level, and expert at 17th level.  
**Stronghold Ability Score Increase.** When you acquire a stronghold of Grade 3 or higher or upgrade a stronghold to Grade 3, one of your ability scores increases by 1, determined by the type of stronghold (see Table: Stronghold Ability Score Increase).  
When you acquire a stronghold of Grade 6 or higher or upgrade a stronghold to Grade 6, your ability score increases by 2, and the maximum for that ability score increases by 2\.  
If you have a choice between ability scores, you choose which ability score to increase each time you gain this benefit.  
**Other Stronghold Benefits.** Most benefits from a stronghold only affect its owner—every member of an adventuring party might chip in for a castle, but there’s only one name on the deed.

**TABLE: STRONGHOLD ABILITY SCORE INCREASES**

| STRONGHOLD TYPE | ABILITY SCORE |
| :---- | :---: |
| Castle, workshop | Strength |
| Menagerie, sacred grove, temple | Wisdom |

# Followers

The maximum number of followers you may have is equal to your Prestige rating, increased by any bonuses you might have from owning a stronghold, or as a reward by the Narrator for accomplishing great deeds.  
Followers aren’t the same as the general staff that maintains your stronghold. Followers are loyal, dedicated to you and your cause, can accompany you on adventures, and provide benefits while out in the field.   
Followers never participate directly in encounters. They fade into the background and come to the fore occasionally when their particular skill is needed. Each follower grants a specific ability or benefit.

## Recruiting Followers

When you recruit a follower, you need to spend gold. In exchange, you get the follower for life. 500 gp recruits an inexperienced follower, 2,000 gp recruits a seasoned follower, and 5,000 gp recruits an expert follower. You only need to pay this once per follower; it is assumed that the amount paid is enough to accommodate the follower for the duration of the campaign. If you dismiss the follower, the Narrator might permit you to reclaim some of that money. If the follower dies, you do not get any money back. Note that not all followers have seasoned or expert versions—carrying a torch isn’t the purview of only experts.  
**Inexperienced.** Inexperienced followers are little more than commoners foolish enough to follow adventurers into a dungeon.  
**Seasoned.** Seasoned followers have either prior employment with adventurers or other experience that prepared them for adventuring.  
**Expert.** Expert followers are consummate professionals, rare individuals who have had their share of adventures but are comfortable in their role as assistant.
