# Condition

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

|            |               |             |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Blinded    | Grappled      | Poisoned    |
| Charmed    | Incapacitated | Prone       |
| Deafened   | Invisible     | Restrained  |
| Exhaustion | Paralyzed     | Stunned     |
| Frightened | Petrified     | Unconscious |

A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The Exhaustion condition is an exception to that rule.
