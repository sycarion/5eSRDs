# Long Rest

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.

During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.

**_Benefits of the Rest._** To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

**Regain All HP.** You regain all lost Hit Points and all spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal.

**Ability Scores Restored.** If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.

**Exhaustion Reduced.** If you have the Exhaustion condition, its level decreases by 1.

**Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.

**_Interrupting the Rest._** A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling Initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage
- 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. *See also* "Short Rest."

You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.
