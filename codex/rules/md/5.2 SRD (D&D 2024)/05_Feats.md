# Feats

## Feat Descriptions

The feats that follow are organized by category— Origin, General, Fighting Style, or Epic Boon—and alphabetized in each category.

### Parts of a Feat

The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat's name.

**Category.** A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you're instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin category, that category must appear under the feat's name. If you're instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any category.
