# Gods & Pantheons

## Fantasy Historical Pantheons

The Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical Earth religions. Mix and match these deities outside of a historical context to serve your game's needs.

### Egyptian Pantheon

These gods are a dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos. They maintain the universal forces of truth, justice, law, and order. As kings and queens lead their vassals, these gods guide their worshippers through mortality and beyond.

### Greek Pantheon

These gods rule from a sky-high mountain realm called Olympus, but they are far from removed from mortal affairs.

### Norse Pantheon

These gods hold court over harsh lands that can claim the lives of mortals not strong or clever enough to survive.

Their powers and bombastic personalities reflect the strong leadership and decisive action required to survive, while embracing life's pleasures.
