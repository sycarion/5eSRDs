You consult an otherworldly entity, risking your very mind in the process. Make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and suffer four levels of strife until you finish a long rest. A _greater restoration_ spell ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to 5 questions before the spell ends. When possible the entity responds with one-word answers: yes, no, maybe, never, irrelevant, or unclear. At the Narrator's discretion, it may instead provide a brief but truthful answer when necessary.
