You create an illusory image of a creature, object, or other visible effect within the area. The illusion is purely visual, it cannot produce sound or smell, and items and other creatures pass through it.

As an action, you can move the image to any point within range. The image's movement can be natural and lifelike (for example, a ball will roll and a bird will fly).

A creature can spend an action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC to determine if the image is an illusion. On a success, it is able to see through the image.
