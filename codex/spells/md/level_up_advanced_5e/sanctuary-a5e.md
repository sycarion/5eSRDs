You ward a creature against intentional harm.

Any creature that makes an attack against or casts a harmful spell against the target must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacking creature must choose a different creature to attack or it loses the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the target from area effects, such as an explosion.

This spell ends early when the target attacks or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature.
