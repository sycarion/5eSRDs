This spell ends a curse inflicted with a spell slot of 3rd-level or lower. If the curse was instead inflicted by a feature or trait, the spell ends a curse inflicted by a creature of Challenge Rating 6 or lower. If cast on a cursed object of Rare or lesser rarity, this spell breaks the owner's attunement to the item (although it does not end the curse on the object).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** For each slot level above 3rd, the spell ends a curse inflicted either by a spell one level higher or by a creature with a Challenge Rating two higher. When using a 6th-level spell slot, the spell breaks the owner's attunement to a Very Rare item.

When using a 9th-level spell slot, the spell breaks the owner's attunement to a Legendary item.
