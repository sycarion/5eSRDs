Oozes and undead have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist this spell. A beam of radiant sunlight streaks from your hand. Each creature in the area takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 round.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action on subsequent turns to create a new beam of sunlight and a mote of brilliant radiance lingers on your hand, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
