You touch a creature, causing its body to spontaneously heal itself. The target immediately regains 4d8 + 15 hit points and regains 10 hit points per minute (1 hit point at the start of each of its turns).

If the target is missing any body parts, the lost parts are restored after 2 minutes. If a severed part is held against the stump, the limb instantaneously reattaches itself.
