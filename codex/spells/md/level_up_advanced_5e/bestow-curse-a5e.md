Choose one of the following:

* Select one ability score; the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws using that ability score.
* The target makes attack rolls against you with disadvantage.
* Each turn, the target loses its action unless it succeeds a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn.
* Your attacks and spells deal an additional 1d8 necrotic damage against the target.

A curse lasts until the spell ends. At the Narrator's discretion you may create a different curse effect with this spell so long as it is weaker than the options above.

A _remove curse_ spell ends the effect if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or greater than the spell slot used to cast _bestow curse_.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When using a 4th-level spell slot the duration increases to 10 minutes. When using a 5th-level spell slot the duration increases to 8 hours and it no longer requires your concentration. When using a 7th-level spell slot the duration is 24 hours.
