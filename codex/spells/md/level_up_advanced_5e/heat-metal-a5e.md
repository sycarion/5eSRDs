The target becomes oven hot. Any creature touching the target takes 2d8 fire damage when the spell is cast. Until the spell ends, on subsequent turns you can use a bonus action to inflict the same damage. If a creature is holding or wearing the target and suffers damage, it makes a Constitution saving throw or it drops the target. If a creature does not or cannot drop the target, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
