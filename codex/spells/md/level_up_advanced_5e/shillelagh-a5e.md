You imbue the target with nature's magical energy. Until the spell ends, the target becomes a magical weapon (if it wasn't already), its damage becomes 1d8, and you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for melee attack and damage rolls made using it. The spell ends if you cast it again or let go of the target.
