Electricity arcs from your hand to shock the target. Make a melee spell attack (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal). On a hit, you deal 1d8 lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn as the electricity courses through its body.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
