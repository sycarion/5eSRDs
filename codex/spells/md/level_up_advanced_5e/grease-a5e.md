Grease erupts from a point that you can see within range and coats the ground in the area, turning it into difficult terrain until the spell ends.

When the grease appears, each creature within the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters or ends its turn in the area must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
