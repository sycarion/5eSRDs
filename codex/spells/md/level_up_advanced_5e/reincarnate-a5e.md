You return the target to life, provided the target's soul is willing and able to return to its body. If you only have a piece of the target, the spell reforms a new adult body for the soul to inhabit. Once reincarnated the target remembers everything from its former life, and retains all its proficiencies, cultural traits, and class features.

The target's heritage traits change according to its new form. The Narrator chooses the form of the new body, or rolls on Table: Reincarnation.
