You call upon your mastery of nature to produce one of the following effects within range:

* You create a minor, harmless sensory effect that lasts for 1 round and predicts the next 24 hours of weather in your current location. For example, the effect might create a miniature thunderhead if storms are predicted.
* You instantly make a plant feature develop, but never to produce Supply. For example, you can cause a flower to bloom or a seed pod to open.
* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect such as the sound of running water, birdsong, or the smell of mulch. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
* You instantly ignite or extinguish a candle, torch, smoking pipe, or small campfire.
