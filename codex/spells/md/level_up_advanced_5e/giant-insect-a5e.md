You transform insects and other vermin into monstrous versions of themselves. Until the spell ends, up to 3 spiders become giant spiders, 2 ants become giant ants, 2 crickets or mantises become ankhegs, a centipede becomes a giant centipede, or a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion. The spell ends for a creature when it dies or when you use an action to end the effect on it.

While it is within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command the insects. When you command multiple insects using this spell, you may simultaneously give them all the same command.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell's duration is 1 hour when using a 5th-level spell slot, or 8 hours when using a 6th-level spell slot.
