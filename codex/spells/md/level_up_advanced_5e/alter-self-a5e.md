You use magic to mold yourself into a new form. Choose one of the options below. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to choose a different option.

* **Amphibian:** Your body takes on aquatic adaptations. You can breathe underwater normally and gain a swimming speed equal to your base Speed.
* **Altered State:** You decide what you look like.  
    
None of your gameplay statistics change but you can alter anything about your body's appearance, including but not limited to: your heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, sound of your voice, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex, and any other distinguishing features. You cannot become a creature of a different size category, and your limb structure remains the same; for example if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become a quadruped. Until the spell ends, you can use an action to change your appearance.
* **Red in Tooth and Claw:** You grow magical natural weapons of your choice with a +1 bonus to attack and damage. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage of a type determined by the natural weapon you chose; for example a tentacle deals bludgeoning, a horn deals piercing, and claws deal slashing.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When using a spell slot of 5th-level, add the following to the list of forms you can adopt.

* **Greater Natural Weapons:** The damage dealt by your natural weapon increases to 2d6, and you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with your natural weapons.
* **Mask of the Grave:** You adopt the appearance of a skeleton or zombie (your choice). Your type changes to undead, and mindless undead creatures ignore your presence, treating you as one of their own. You don't need to breathe and you become immune to poison.
* **Wings:** A pair of wings sprouts from your back. The wings can appear bird-like, leathery like a bat or dragon's wings, or like the wings of an insect. You gain a fly speed equal to your base Speed.
