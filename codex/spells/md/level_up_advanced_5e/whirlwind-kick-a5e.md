You must be able to move in order to cast this spell. You leap into the air and spin like a tornado, striking foes all around you with supernatural force as you fly up to 60 feet in a straight line. Your movement (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity) must end on a surface that can support your weight or you fall as normal.

As part of the casting of this spell, make a melee spell attack against any number of creatures in the area. On a hit, you deal your unarmed strike damage plus 2d6 thunder damage. In addition, creatures in the area make a Dexterity saving throw or are either pulled 10 feet closer to you or pushed 10 feet away (your choice).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The extra thunder damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
