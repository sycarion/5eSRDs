You throw a mushroom at a point within range and detonate it, creating a cloud of spores that fills the area. The cloud of spores travels around corners, and the area is considered lightly obscured for everyone except you. Creatures and objects within the area are covered in spores.

Until the spell ends, you know the exact location of all affected objects and creatures. Any attack roll you make against an affected creature or object has advantage, and the affected creatures and objects can't benefit from being invisible.
