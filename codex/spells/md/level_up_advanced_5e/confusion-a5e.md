You assault the minds of your targets, filling them with delusions and making them confused until the spell ends. On a successful saving throw, a target is rattled for 1 round. At the end of each of its turns, a confused target makes a Wisdom saving throw to end the spell's effects on it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell's area increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
