Until the spell ends, flames envelop your body, casting bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can use an action to end the spell early. Choose one of the following options:

* **Chill Shield:** You have resistance to fire damage. A creature within 5 feet of you takes 2d8 cold damage when it hits you with a melee attack.
* **Warm Shield:** You have resistance to cold damage. A creature within 5 feet of you takes 2d8 fire damage when it hits you with a melee attack.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases to 1 hour when using a 6th-level spell slot, or 8 hours when using an 8th-level spell slot.
