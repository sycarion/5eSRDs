A swarm of insects fills the area. Creatures that begin their turn within the spell's area or who enter the area for the first time on their turn must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage. The pests also ravage any unattended organic material within their radius, such as plant, wood, or fabric.
