You magically hide away a willing creature or object. The target becomes invisible, and it cannot be traced or detected by divination or scrying sensors. If the target is a living creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation and stops aging.

The spell ends when the target takes damage or a condition you set occurs. The condition can be anything you choose, like a set amount of time or a specific event, but it must occur within or be visible within 1 mile of the target.
