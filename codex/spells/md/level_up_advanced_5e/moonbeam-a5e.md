A beam of moonlight fills the area with dim light.

When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn in the area, it is struck by silver flames and makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a shapechanger is forced to take its original form while within the spell's light.

On your turn, you may use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
