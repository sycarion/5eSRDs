Holy radiance emanates from you and fills the area. Targets shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on saving throws. Attacks made against a target have disadvantage. When a fiend or undead hits a target, the aura erupts into blinding light, forcing the attacker to make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
