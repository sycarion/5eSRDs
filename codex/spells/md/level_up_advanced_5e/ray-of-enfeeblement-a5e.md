A black ray of necrotic energy shoots from your fingertip. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target is weakened and only deals half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength.

At the end of each of the target's turns, it can make a Strength saving throw, ending the spell on a success.
