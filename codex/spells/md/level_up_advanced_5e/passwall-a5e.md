Until the spell ends, you create a passage extending into the target surface. When creating the passage you define its dimensions, as long as they do not exceed 5 feet in width, 8 feet in height, or 20 feet in depth.

The appearance of the passage has no effect on the stability of the surrounding environment.

Any creatures or objects within the passage when the spell ends are expelled without harm into unoccupied spaces near where the spell was cast.
