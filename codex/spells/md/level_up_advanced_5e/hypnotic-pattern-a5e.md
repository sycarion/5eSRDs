You conjure a swirling pattern of twisting hues that roils through the air, appearing for a moment and then vanishing. Creatures in the area that can perceive the pattern make a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed. A creature charmed by this spell becomes incapacitated and its Speed is reduced to 0.

The effect ends on a creature when it takes damage or when another creature uses an action to shake it out of its daze.
