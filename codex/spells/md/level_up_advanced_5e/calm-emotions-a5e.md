Strong and harmful emotions are suppressed within the area. You can choose which of the following two effects to apply to each target of this spell.

* Suppress the charmed or frightened conditions, though they resume when the spell ends (time spent suppressed counts against a condition's duration).
* Suppress hostile feelings towards creatures of your choice until the spell ends. This suppression ends if a target is attacked or sees its allies being attacked. Targets act normally when the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell area increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
