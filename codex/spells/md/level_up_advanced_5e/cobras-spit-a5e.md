Until the spell ends, you can use an action to spit venom, making a ranged spell attack at a creature or object within 30 feet. On a hit, the venom deals 4d8 poison damage, and if the target is a creature it is poisoned until the end of its next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
