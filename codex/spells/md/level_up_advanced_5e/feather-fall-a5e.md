Magic slows the descent of each target. Until the spell ends, a target's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round. If a target lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, ending the spell for that target.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When using a 2nd-level spell slot, targets can move horizontally 1 foot for every 1 foot they descend, effectively gliding through the air until they land or the spell ends.
