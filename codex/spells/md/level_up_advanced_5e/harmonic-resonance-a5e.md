You harmonize with the rhythm of those around you until you're perfectly in sync. You may take the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when a creature within 30 feet uses a Bardic Inspiration die, you may choose to reroll the die after it is rolled but before the outcome is determined.

You cannot cast another spell through your spellcasting focus while concentrating on this spell.
