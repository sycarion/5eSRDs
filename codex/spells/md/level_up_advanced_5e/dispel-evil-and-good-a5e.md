A nimbus of power surrounds you, making you more able to resist and destroy beings from beyond the realms material.

Until the spell ends, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using an action to do either of the following.

* **Mental Resistance:** Choose up to 3 friendly creatures within 60 feet. Each of those creatures that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead may make an immediate saving throw with advantage against the condition or possession, ending it on a success.
* **Retribution:** Make a melee spell attack against a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within reach. On a hit, the creature takes 7d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) and is stunned until the beginning of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Mental Resistance targets one additional creature for each slot level above 5th, and Retribution's damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
