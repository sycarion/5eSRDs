You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force that mimics the appearance and movements of your own hand.

The hand doesn't fill its space and has AC 20, Strength 26 (+8), Dexterity 10 (+0), maneuver DC 18, and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. The spell ends early if it is dropped to 0 hit points.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then choose one of the following.

* **_Shove:_** The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the hand pushes the creature in a direction of your choosing for up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to 5 times your spellcasting ability modifier, and remains within 5 feet of it.
* **_Smash:_** Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object within 5 feet of the hand. On a hit, the hand deals 4d8 force damage.
* **_Snatch:_** The hand makes a Strength saving throw against the maneuver DC of a creature within 5 feet of it, with advantage if the creature is Medium or smaller. On a success, the creature is grappled by the hand. You can use a bonus action to crush a creature grappled by the hand, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
* **_Stop:_** Until the hand is given another command it moves to stay between you and a creature of your choice, providing you with three-quarters cover against the chosen creature. A creature with a Strength score of 26 or less cannot move through the hand's space, and stronger creatures treat the hand as difficult terrain.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage from Smash increases by 2d8 and the damage from Snatch increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.
