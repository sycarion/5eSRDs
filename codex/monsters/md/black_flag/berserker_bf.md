- **Stalwart:** If the berserker starts its turn afflicted by an ongoing effect that allows for a repeated save to end the effect, such as the hold spell or the poison from an ettercap's Bite, the gladiator can make the save at the start of the turn instead of the end and has advantage on the save.

- **Greataxe:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (1d12+4) slashing damage.
