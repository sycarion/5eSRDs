### Bonus Actions

- **Throw:** One Large or smaller creature grappled by the ape is thrown up to 50 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 DEX save or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
