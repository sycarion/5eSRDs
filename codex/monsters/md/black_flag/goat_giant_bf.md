### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the goat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a Ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.

### Actions

- **Ram:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4+3) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

- **Terrifying Scream:** When the goat takes damage, it can release a high-pitched scream, frightening creatures within 10 feet of it. Each creature in that area that can hear the scream must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn. A creature frightened in this way can't be frightened by this goat's Terrifying Scream again for the next 24 hours.
