- **Death Burst:** When the magmin dies, it collapses into a Tiny cinder cone. On initiative count 20 after the magmin dies, the cinder cone erupts in a burst of fire and lava. Each creature within 10 feet of the cone must make a DC 11 DEX save, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried in that area are ignited.
- **Hardened Magma:** While the magmin isn't ablaze, it is resistant to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and it is vulnerable to thunder damage.
- **Molten Body:** While the magmin is ablaze, each creature that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.
