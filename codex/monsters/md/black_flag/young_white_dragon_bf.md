### Special Abilities

- **Ice Walk:** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. In addition, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.
- **Numbing Chill:** When the white dragon hasn’t unleashed its Cold Breath, the cold builds up within it and ripples outward from it. While the dragon’s Cold Breath is available, it emits a numbing chill, and each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or its speed is reduced by 10 feet.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d10+4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage.
- **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 CON save, taking 31 (7d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
