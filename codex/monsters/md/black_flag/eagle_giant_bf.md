- **Seabird:** The eagle can swim up to 40 feet on its turn, but it must start and end its movement either flying or on a solid surface, such as a ship or beach. If it is swimming at the end of its turn, it must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or it immediately begins to sink and suffocate. A suffocating eagle must succeed on a DC 13 STR check to fly out of the substance where it is sinking.
