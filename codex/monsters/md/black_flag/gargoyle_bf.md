If the target is prone, the gargoyle can make one Bite attack against it as a bonus action.
- **False Appearance:** While the gargoyle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue.

### Reactions

- **Fearsome Mien:** When a creature the gargoyle can see hits it with an attack, the gargoyle can shift its face to appear more monstrous. The attacker must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or be frightened of the gargoyle until the end of its next turn.
