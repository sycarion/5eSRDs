### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The dragon can breathe air and water.
- **Lightning Extraction:** After the bronze dragon uses its Lightning Breath, its body begins recharging with lightning, pulling electricity from nearby creatures. While the dragon's Lightning Breath is unavailable, each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must make a DC 15 CON save. On a failure, a creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Repulsion Breath, if available.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d10+5) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage.
- **Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 DEX save, taking 49 (9d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Repulsion Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 STR save or be pushed up to 15 feet away from the dragon.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The dragon magically transforms into a Beast or Humanoid that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Dragon. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
