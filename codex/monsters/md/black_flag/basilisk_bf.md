### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The basilisk is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Petrifying Gaze:** When a creature that can see the basilisk's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk, the basilisk can force it to make a DC 12 CON save if the basilisk isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the save at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the save at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If the basilisk sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the basilisk mistakes itself for a rival and is affected by its own gaze.
