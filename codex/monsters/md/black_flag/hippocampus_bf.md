### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The hippocampus can breathe air and water.
- **Shared Breath:** The hippocampus's gills pull more air from the water than the hippocampus needs, expelling the excess as bubbles down its neck and across its back. If an air-breathing creature is riding the hippocampus, these bubbles can provide that creature a supply of fresh air when the hippocampus isn't in combat or traveling at a fast pace.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hippocampus makes one Bite attack and one Tail Slap attack.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6+4) piercing damage.
- **Tail Slap:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8+4) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Rearing Kick:** The hippocampus rears up and kicks its forelegs at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone or pushed up to 10 feet away from the hippocampus (the hippocampus's choice).
