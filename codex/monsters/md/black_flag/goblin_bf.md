### Actions

- **Scimitar:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.
- **Shortbow:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) piercing damage.
- **Gang Up (1/Day):** The goblin moves up to half its speed toward a creature it can see. Each friendly goblin within 30 feet of the goblin can use its reaction to join the gang up and move up to half its speed toward the same target. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. If the initiating goblin is within 5 feet of the target, the target must make a DC 12 DEX save, taking 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For each goblin after the first that participated in the gang up and that is within 10 feet of the target, the damage increases by 1 as arrows, knives, sharp pocket scraps, and similar "weapons" fly at the target from all angles. Afterwards, each goblin after the first that participated in the gang up can't use Gang Up until it finishes a short or long rest.

### Bonus Actions

- **Nimble Escape:** The goblin takes the Disengage or Hide action.
