### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The bulette is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Standing Leap:** The bulette's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bulette makes two Bite attacks.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 20 (3d10+4) piercing damage.
- **Deadly Leap (Recharge 5-6):** The bulette leaps up to 30 feet, diving onto a point it can see or sense within that range and landing on its feet with a thunderous crash. It occupies a space of its choice within 5 feet of that point, and each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 15 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone. Any creature in the bulette's space is then pushed into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bulette. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's space.

### Bonus Actions

- **Seek Prey:** The bulette looks and sniffs around for new prey, releasing a satisfied, guttural chirp when it settles on one. One creature the bulette can see or sense within 30 feet of it and that can see or hear the bulette must make a DC 15 WIS save. On a failure, the target is frightened until the end of its next turn, and the bulette has advantage on the next attack roll it makes against the creature before the start of its next turn.
