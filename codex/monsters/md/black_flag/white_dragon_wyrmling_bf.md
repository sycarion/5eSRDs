### Special Abilities

- **Ice Walk:** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. In addition, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.
- **Pounce:** If the dragon moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the dragon can make one Claw attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) cold damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.
- **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 CON save, taking 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
