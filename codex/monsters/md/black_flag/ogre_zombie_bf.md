### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ogre zombie makes two Greatclub attacks.
- **Greatclub:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Lumbering Charge (Recharge 5-6):** The ogre zombie shoulders its weapon and charges forward, shoving into creatures on its way. It moves up to 20 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Medium or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a DC 14 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
