### Special Abilities

- **Freezing Fog:** After the silver dragon uses its Cold Breath, freezing fog surrounds it. While the dragon's Cold Breath is unavailable, each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 17 CON save or be restrained until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Paralyzing Breath, if available.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10+6) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d6+6) slashing damage.
- **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 CON save, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Paralyzing Breath (Recharge 6):** As the **silver dragon wyrmling**, except it is a 30-foot cone, and the save DC is 17.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The dragon magically transforms into a Beast or Humanoid that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Dragon. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
