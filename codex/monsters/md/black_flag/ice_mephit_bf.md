### Special Abilities

- **Death Burst:** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of viscous ice. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be restrained by ice for 1 minute. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 11 STR check. The ice melts immediately if the restrained creature takes fire damage, freeing the creature.
- **False Appearance:** While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary shard of ice.

### Actions

- **Claws:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Ice Shard:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Frost Breath (Recharge 6):** The mephit exhales freezing fog in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) cold damage and is restrained by ice until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained.

### Bonus Actions

- **Cloud of Snow (1/Day):** The mephit casts the fog cloud spell, requiring no material components and using CHA as the spellcasting ability.
