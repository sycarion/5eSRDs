## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The chuul can breathe air and water.

***Sense Magic.*** The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of itself. This trait otherwise works like the *Detect Magic* spell but isn't itself magical.


## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The chuul makes two Pincer attacks and uses Paralyzing Tentacles.

***Pincer.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 10 ft. 9 (1d10 + 4) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the Grappled condition (escape DC 14) from one of two pincers.

***Paralyzing Tentacles.*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 13, one creature Grappled by the chuul. *Failure:*  The target has the Poisoned condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically. While Poisoned, the target has the Paralyzed condition.
