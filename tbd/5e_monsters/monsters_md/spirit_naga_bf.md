### Special Abilities

- **Guardian Projection:** The spirit naga's skeletal form is covered with a magical illusion that makes it look like the guardian naga it was in life. The naga can use a bonus action to dismiss this illusion until the end of its next turn. The changes wrought by this illusion fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, a creature touching the spirit naga would feel its rough, dry scales and exposed bones instead of the smooth, cool scales of a guardian naga. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 INT (Investigation) check to discern the spirit naga's true appearance.
- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The naga is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.
- **Necrotic Strikes:** The naga's weapon attacks are magical. When the naga hits with any weapon attack, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 necrotic damage (included in the attack).
- **Rejuvenation:** If it dies, the naga returns to life in 1d6 days, regaining all its HP and becoming active again. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spirit naga makes two Bite or Spit Poison attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d4+4) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage and 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.
- **Spit Poison:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (3d4+3) poison damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.
- **Spellcasting:** The spirit naga casts one of the following spells, requiring only verbal components and using CHA as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14).<br>At will: _command_, _mage hand_, _minor illusion_<br>3/day each: _augury_ (as an action), _charm_, _sleep_<br>2/day each: _bestow curse_, _hold_<br>1/day: _dominate_

### Bonus Actions

- **Hidden Step:** The spirit naga magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see and takes the Hide action.
