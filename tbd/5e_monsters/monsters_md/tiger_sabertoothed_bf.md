### Special Abilities

- **Heightened Smell:** The tiger's Perception is 18 when perceiving by smell.
- **Pounce:** If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claws attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the tiger can make one Claws attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tiger makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 9 (1d10+4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 DEX save or suffer a puncture wound. A creature suffering a puncture wound loses 5 (1d10) HP at the start of each of its turns as the wound bleeds excessively. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 WIS (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
- **Claws:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (2d4+4) slashing damage.
