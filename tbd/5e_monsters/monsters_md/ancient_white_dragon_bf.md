### Special Abilities

- **Ice Walk:** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. In addition, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a save, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Numbing Chill:** When the white dragon hasn't unleashed its Cold Breath, the cold builds up within it and ripples outward from it. While the dragon's Cold Breath is available, it emits a numbing chill, and each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 CON save or its speed is halved.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 19 (2d10+8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d6+8) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d8+8) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 WIS save or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 CON save, taking 63 (14d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon automatically detects every creature and trap within 30 feet of it, pinpointing the current location of each.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Elemental Roar (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon roars at up to two creatures of its choice within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 17 CHA save or be vulnerable to cold damage until the end of its next turn. A target resistant to cold damage isn't resistant to it for the duration. A target immune to cold damage is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 DEX save or take 15 (2d6+8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
