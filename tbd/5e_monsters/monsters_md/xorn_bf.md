- **Stone Camouflage:** The xorn's Stealth is 18 while in rocky terrain.
- **Treasure Sense:** The xorn can pinpoint, by scent, the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The xorn makes one Bite attack and three Claw attacks, or it makes three Lob Stone attacks.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (3d6+3) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage.
- **Lob Stone:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d8+3) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shard Belch:** The xorn belches a mixture of stomach gas and crystalline shards in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 DEX save or be coated in miniscule, crystalline shards until the end of its next turn. A creature coated in shards suffers bouts of pain each time it moves, reducing its speed by 10 feet and imposing disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.
