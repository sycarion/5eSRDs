### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The harpy is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The harpy makes two Claw or Screech attacks. If both Screech attacks hit one Giant or Humanoid, the target has disadvantage on the next save it makes against the harpy's Luring Song before the start of the harpy's next turn.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage.
- **Screech:** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (2d6+1) thunder damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Luring Song:** The harpy sings a magical melody. Every Humanoid and Giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must use a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.<br>While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the save. A charmed target can also repeat the save at the end of each of its turns. If the save is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.
