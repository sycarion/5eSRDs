## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.

***Corrosive Form.*** Nonmagical ammunition is destroyed immediately after hitting the ooze and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the ooze and coming into contact with it. The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches -5. The penalty can be removed by casting the *Mending* spell on the weapon.
The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal or wood in 1 round.


## Actions
