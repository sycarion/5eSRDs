<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The dragon turtle can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Siege Monster:</strong> The dragon turtle deals double damage to objects and structures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The dragon turtle makes one Bite attack, two Claw attacks, and one Tail attack. If it is latched onto a vehicle, it can instead make four Claw attacks and one Tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 33 (4d12+7) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. Instead of dealing damage, the dragon turtle can choose to latch onto the target, if the target is a vehicle, such as a ship or wagon. If the vehicle is Huge or smaller, its speed is reduced to 0, and it can't be moved until the dragon turtle is killed or ends this effect. If the vehicle is Gargantuan, the vehicle's speed is halved, and the turtle moves with it when it moves. While latched onto a vehicle in this way, the turtle can make Bite attacks against only the vehicle and such attacks automatically hit. The turtle can end this effect at any time (no action required).</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (3d8+7) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tail:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 29 (4d10+7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 STR save or be pushed up to 15 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 CON save, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Siege Follow-Through:</strong> If the dragon turtle destroys an object or structure with an attack, it can make a Bite or Tail attack against a creature it can see within 5 feet of that object or structure.</li>
</ul>
