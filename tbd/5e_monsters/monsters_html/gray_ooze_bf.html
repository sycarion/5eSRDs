<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amorphous:</strong> The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</li>
<li><strong>Corrode Metal:</strong> Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance:</strong> While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from ordinary fresh or curing mortar.</li>
<li><strong>Ooze Nature:</strong> The ooze doesn't require sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Ooze Resilience:</strong> The ooze is resistant to the grappled and restrained conditions, and it is immune to exhaustion and to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, and prone conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pseudopod:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 3 (1d4+1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage, and if the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, the armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solidify:</strong> When the ooze is hit by an attack, it can partially solidify its body, reducing the damage it takes by 2 (1d4). If it has taken fire damage since the start of its last turn, the damage it takes is reduced by 3 (1d6) instead. The ooze can't use this reaction if it has taken cold damage since the start of its last turn.</li>
