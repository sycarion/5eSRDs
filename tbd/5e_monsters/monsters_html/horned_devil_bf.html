<h3>Actions</h3>

<li><strong>Fork:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (3d8+6) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tail:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (3d10+6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 17 CON save or lose 10 (3d6) HP at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 10 (3d6). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 WIS (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.</li>
<li><strong>Hurl Flame:</strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +7 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (5d6+3) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.</li>

<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>

<li><strong>Headbutt:</strong> The horned devil slams its horned head into a creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 STR save. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.</li>
