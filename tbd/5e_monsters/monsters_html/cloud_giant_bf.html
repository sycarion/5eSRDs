<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloudsight:</strong> The cloud giant can see through areas obscured by clouds, fog, smoke, and steam without penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Giant Attributes:</strong> The cloud giant is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition.</li>
<li><strong>Heightened Smell:</strong> The cloud giant's Perception is 22 when perceiving by smell.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The cloud giant makes three Cloud-Coated Mace attacks, or it makes two Wind Burst attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud-Coated Mace:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (3d6+8) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.</li>
<li><strong>Wind Burst:</strong> <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +8 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 31 (5d10+4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 STR save or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the cloud giant and knocked prone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Cover:</strong> The cloud giant creates a 20-foot cube of clouds centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. The cube spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until the cloud giant dies, or until the cloud giant uses this bonus action again.</li>
<li><strong>Condense:</strong> The cloud giant causes a 20-foot-radius sphere of cloud, fog, smoke, or steam centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it to become as thick as mud, making the area difficult terrain for creatures moving through it. A creature that starts its turn in the hardened cloud must succeed on a DC 15 STR save or be restrained until the start of its next turn. The cloud remains condensed for 1 minute, until the cloud giant dies, or until the cloud giant uses this bonus action again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cirrus Deflection:</strong> The cloud giant creates a bit of hardened cloud between it and an attacker, increasing the giant's AC by 4. To do so, it must be able to see the attacker.</li>
</ul>
