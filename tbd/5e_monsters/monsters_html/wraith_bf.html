<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporeal Movement:</strong> The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, and its Perception is 7 when perceiving by sight.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Nature:</strong> The wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Undead Resilience:</strong> The wraith is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The wraith makes two Life Drain attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Life Drain:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (4d6+4) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or its HP maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0.</li>
<li><strong>Create Specter:</strong> The wraith targets one Humanoid it can see within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a <strong>specter</strong> in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The <strong>specter</strong> is under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trail of Death (Recharge 4-6):</strong> The wraith moves up to 30 feet in a straight line. This distance is not reduced by moving through creatures or objects, and this movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 DEX save or be afflicted with wasting doom. While afflicted with wasting doom, a creature takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Wasting doom ends if a creature starts its turn in sunlight or regains HP.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unravel Life:</strong> When a creature the wraith can see within 30 feet of it and that isn't a Construct or Undead regains HP, the wraith can corrupt the healing energies, halving the amount of healing that creature receives.</li>
</ul>
