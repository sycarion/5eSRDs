RPG tip: Instead of thinking about a boss encounter as strictly tactical combat, ask what big story element will be revealed during the confrontation.
RPG tip: Smart villains know the devastation caused by splitting the party. How can they use that to their advantage?

RPG tip: Be careful with character manipulation at the end of a campaign. Let the player drive their character's actions and desires. Don't tug too hard. 
RPG tip: Drive the final boss battle from the story. It doesn't need to be a perfectly well designed combat encounter. The story of the battle matters more than the mechanics. 
RPG tip: Defeating a boss doesn't always mean killing it in combat. It could be destroying the boss's plans with a single word, act, or deed.

RPG tip: Sometimes what players say they want out of their D&D games, and what they ACTUALLY want aren't the same things. Observe their behavior as much as listening to their feedback.
RPG tip: Campaigns don't have to be long affairs, build fun and focused campaigns that last about five to ten levels.

RPG tip: As anxious as we feel about running our next game, we can remember that we're with friends and all of us want to have a good time.

RPG tip: Go easy at level 1 and get them to level 2 fast. This is the most deadly level for characters of any.  
RPG tip: In the right circumstances, kobolds can always be deadly.  
RPG tip: Beautiful fantasy maps can draw your players into the world their characters inhabit. . 
RPG tip: Improvise NPCs from your favorite movie or TV characters.

RPG tip: At low levels, even a battle against rat swarms becomes a fight to remember. (artist unknown) 
RPG tip: If a scene start to feel boring, feel free to jump forward to the next interesting path you can see.  
RPG tip: Not all fantastic items need be magical. A clockwork fish in a bowl can be well loved and remembered.  
RPG tip: Instead of copying monster stat blocks down, simply use the actual monster manual at the table. This helps you avoid railroading towards certain monsters if the story ends up in a different direction. 
RPG tip: There is little need to build your own NPC stat blocks. Simply reskin one of the NPC stat blocks in the Monster Manual or Volo's Guide. Close enough is just fine.  
RPG tip: Battle maps and terrain need not only serve combat but also as visual guides for exploration and roleplaying.
RPG tip: The world does not conform to the level of the characters but that doesn't mean the characters don't have a chance to see when they're outmatched.  
RPG tip: Monsters aren't always standing guard waiting for the characters to rush in. Sometimes they have other problems.  
RPG tip: Weather and celebrations are a great way to add another dimension of life to your adventure.  
RPG tip: Players love to have a base of operations to call their own. A dwelling, lair, fortress, or ship make fantastic rewards.  
RPG tip: Give players an expectation of the types of gameplay they might expect in a particular session. If they don't seem interested, consider a pivot.  
RPG tip: Mix in upward beats with your downward bits of terror in a suspence or horror session or it will seem like a slog the whole time. Give them some fun breaks.  
RPG tip: Offer inspiration to those willing to step foward into obvious danger to keep the game moving smoothly.  
RPG tip: Build murder mysteries by laying out what happened and writing down potential clues the characters can discover that might reveal the true story.  
RPG tip: Feel free to change the result of a mystery if the players went down a different and more interesting road.  
RPG tip: Two mysteries wound together can add fun complications to an investigation.  
RPG tip: Keep the madness effects on hand. Madness is a wonderful universal mechanic for horror in D&D.  
RPG tip: Spend less time talking and more time listening. Enjoy the banter of the players and step in when guidance and direction is needed.  
RPG tip: Describe the failed special attacks of monsters as you would the successes so the characters recognize how close they came to the edge of doom.  
RPG tip: Build situations, not plots or solutions. Let the players choose how to approach the challenges in front of them.  
RPG tip: Give chracters a cool home base they can call their own. Let them customize it how they want and refer to it often.  
RPG tip: Tap into the reactions of players to fill in the details of NPCs. If their nickname is cool or funny, let it stick.  
RPG tip: Break up travel with a fantastic spooky monument and the monsters to which it calls. 
RPG tip: Generate random NPCs to break away from stereotypes or cliches.  
RPG tip: Base in-game events to real-world events. On the night of a supermoon in real life, have them fight the beasts of the supermoon!
RPG tip: We don't need to write down the stats of our reskinned monsters. Make the changes in your head and use the base statistics at the table.  
RPG tip: Keep the pace of the adventure moving fast. Don't linger in one scene when it starts to get stale; leap forward.  
RPG tip: This is our monthly reminder to write down NPC names when they appear in our games. Players feel them break apart into ethereal mist when even we can't remember their names.  
RPG tip: Let the players plan their approach to invading a small fort, pirate ship, defended keep, tower, or villa. We need not railroad them into one approach. Set the situation and let them choose the approach.  
RPG tip: Write down the hooks that seem to resonate to the players. Let those guide where the game moves forward.  
RPG tip: Watch the movies that fit the theme of the adventure you're running to fill your head with ideas you can improvise as you run the game. 
RPG tip: Offer advantage on attacks for those willing to perform a skill check to gain an advantageous position in combat. It's an easy mechanic for an infinite range of awesome flavorful situations and attacks.  
RPG tip: Monsters don't always make optimal moves. Let them make bonehead mistakes for the fun of the story and the game.  
RPG tip: Help players break away from counting squares by letting them move more squares than they normally could so they can actually engage an enemy other than waste a whole turn.  
RPG tip: Tell small bits of the story, history, and situation through small bits of lore the characters learn with skill checks as they investigate the world around them.  
RPG tip: Use video game soundtracks for background music during your game. My personal favorite? Witcher 3! 
RPG tip: Keep your group's size down to four or five players so each player gets enough screen time.  
RPG tip: Never worry about putting piles of low challenge rating monsters in front of your higher level characters.  
RPG tip: We can get away with just about anything for monster miniatures on a map but players really love to have nice miniatures for their characters.
RPG tip: Keep a set of generic pogs or tokens for monster minis when running unexpected improvised combat and keeping the flow of the game moving smoothly. 
RPG tip: For a truly lethal game, remember that damage to a character at zero hit points inflicts a death save. An assassin can use all three attacks to kill a downed character outright.  
RPG tip: Offer multiple lines of investigation and let the players follow those that they discover, choose, or enjoy.  
RPG tip: Player's don't all seek the same thing from our games. Take their feedback, consider it, and make small changes to improve your game carefully.  
RPG tip: Though a player cannot pull the punch on a ranged attack or spell to knock out an opponent, nothing prevents you from asking the player whether the shot or blast killed the character by sheer circumstance.  
RPG tip: When planning your game, build sitiuations and have the NPCs act as they would act even if the characters aren't there. Let the characters interact with the situation.  
RPG tip: If your characters find a creative way to circumvent a long plot line you had planned, let them! They will find their way to new and interesting adventures. . 
RPG tip: If the actions of your characters have a big impact in the world they may not see, break away from their PoV and describe the impact from another character's view.  
RPG tip: Reskin scenes and situations you had planned to fit the unexpected direction your characters took. A scene in a ball might turn into a carnival.  
RPG tip: When thinking about your game, seed your brain by repeating the names of the characters over in your head.  
RPG tip: Give the players clues that villains may be scrying upon them. Let them worry about it or use it for their own advantage.  
RPG tip: Put hard choices in front of the players and don't pre-suppose the answers. Give them reasonable options instead of death behind two of three doors.   
RPG tip: Drop clues and lore in random encounters to tie them to the main story.  
RPG tip: Keep inspirational art at hand to help you imagine and enrich fantastic locations.  
RPG tip: Encourage the narrative descriptions of attacks and killing blows from your players to draw them into the story.  
RPG tip: Use the tools and accessories that help you run your game smoothly and with the flexibility to change as the story changes. (pic from @newbiedm) 
RPG tip: Ask your players to describe interesting sights, sounds, smells, and situations instead of droning through long descriptions of travel.  
RPG tip: The limitless age and experience of hags are their ultimate weapon. How will they thwart your heroes from afar?  
RPG tip: Go big with fantastic features. Nothing creates awe like sheer size.  
RPG tip: Monsters might not be simply motivated to kill the characters. Sometimes they just hate fire and want to put it out...or start one.  
RPG tip: Focus the spotlight on the NPCs the players find the most interesting.  
RPG tip: Select the number and type of monsters by the story and situation. Check to see if the encounter is deadly with Kobold Fight Club.  
RPG tip: Bring back NPCs from previous campaigns to reward your players for their past stories.  
RPG tip: Throw easy encounters into the mix so the players don't feel like they've had a whole night of getting the crap kicked out of them.  
RPG tip: Not all players enjoy or loathe the same things in our games. Survey regularly and take note of who likes what.  
RPG tip: Vary the damage of traps so they don't feel too vanilla. Don't put too many traps in a row.  
RPG tip: Pondering how to start a new campaign or fork into a new one from an existing one? Have a new session zero and bring the players into the discussion. Ask them what they want out of it.  
RPG tip: Scenes with antagonistic NPCs might or might not turn into a fight. Don't force them one way or the other. Let the scenes evolve as the characters interact.  
RPG tip: Printing 11x17 maps from published adventures is a great way to squeeze a lot of the production value of published adventures into our game without breaking the bank. (map by Mike Schley) 
RPG tip: Learn from everywhere. Read books. Watch movies. Watch #dnd streams. Take a break from social media and read an actual D&D sourcebook.  
RPG tip: Instead of having a high-level NPC save the party, give the stat block to one of the players and let them RUN the high-level NPC in a big battle.  
RPG tip: Re-use interesting combat encounter areas by having the characters return to the scenes of old battles to face new foes.  
RPG tip: Did the characters suddenly come into unexpected wealth (say slaying a dragon)? Don't find ways to steal all their money. Let them change the world with it.  
RPG tip: Make sure the scope of the story matches the level of the characters. Rat swarms are suitable for level 1. Demon princes are suitable for level 20. The scope and scale of the characters' actions should increase proportionally.  
RPG tip: Use loaded questions to guide character creation "Why does your character want to travel into the jungles of Chult with the rest of the party to stop the death curse?"  
RPG tip: Make sure to write down what the players bring to your session zero. It's your best chance to understand what the characters are bringing to the campaign.  
RPG tip: A big 36" by 48" sheet of acryllic is a perfect tabletop accessory. You can slide maps, pictures, and handouts underneath. It's perfectly flat and miniatures feel great on it. 
RPG tip: Old characters can become the patrons of new characters in a new campaign. Let previous characters have a background impact in the new campaign.  
RPG tip: When running a published adventure, make sure to have one or more strong threads that help the players make choices and navigate open worlds.  
RPG tip: Want to paint a Reaper Bone in a hurry and on a budget? Paint it with gray gesso and use an ink wash on it for a nice-looking table-ready gray-scale mini. 
RPG tip: Do you have a great idea for an action-packed scene? Don't force the story to lead them there, just start them right in the middle of it! "How did you end up riding a Triceratops in the Unchained dinosaur race?" 
RPG tip: Jot down a list of interesting locations in towns or cities in published adventures so you have a quick index and don't have to flip pages. 
RPG tip: When running a published adventure, spend time reviewing the next section even if you've already read it. A refresher is always handy. 
RPG tip: Even if you have piles of miniatures, keep some generic monster tokens on hand for improvised battles or small fights that don't demand you dig through the vaults looking for the perfect mini.
RPG tip: Adding a daily spell to a magic item is a great way to make it both thematic and mechanically useful.  
RPG tip: A strong start is very important. So is knowing where things might go AFTER the strong start. What's next when that scene is done?  
RPG tip: Choose the tools for running your D&D game that help you stay flexible and improve your improvisation. Less is more. 
RPG tip: Outline important locations in a city and offer these options to players so they don't feel completely lost when exploring this large city. 
RPG tip: The soundtrack to Darkest Dungeon makes for some excellent D&D background music. 
RPG tip: Give magic items a name, a history, and a once-per-day spell effect to make them unique, powerful, and exciting.  
RPG tip: Keep small dungeons on hand when the players want some fun exploring lost ruins, ancient temples, forgotten cellars, and other unexplored locations.  
RPG tip: Dark dreams and strange portents are great ways to drop hard clues in on characters.  
RPG tip: Zombies are harder to kill than you'd think for a challenge 1/4 monster. Be prepared for a hard slog if it keeps making it's constitution save.  
RPG tip: Need some dinosaur minis for your Tomb of Annihilation game? Pick up a sheet of dinosaurs from @TrashMobMinis and @JohnPuhCreation. 
RPG tip: Spend some time describing the grandeour of the characters' location including sights, sounds, and smells.  
RPG tip: Keep a careful eye on the challenge of improvised threats. Two CR 5 creatures are definitely too hard for five level 3 characters.  
RPG tip: Describe situations and observations by the context of the characters. The assassin's killer instinct tells her that invisible eyes are upon her.  
RPG tip: Sometimes a list of ten secrets and clues the characters might discover during the adventure is all you need to run a fun game.  
RPG tip: Use weather, potential random encounters, the results of exploration skill checks, and interesting ancient monuments to build a rich scene during your exploration adventures.  
RPG tip: Start your preparation by running through the characters to put their stories firmly in your head before you prep anything else.  
RPG tip: Make dungeons seem mysterious and real by adding the sound of large wheels, running water, and dropping counterweights behind the walls of the halls they explore.  
RPG tip: Spend a quick moment reading up on the story of a monster before throwing them at your group. You might glean some interesting story hooks from the monster's background.  
RPG tip: Low challenge monsters like koblds and goblins can still harass higher-level characters by setting off traps, stealing goods, or alerting larger foes.  
RPG tip: Interesting scenes have a lot going on in them. Goblins stealing canoes and blowing a horn to call a t-rex right after the characters left a dungeon. 
RPG tip: Some of the most interesting magical items have no combat value but lots of roleplay value.  
RPG tip: Only have a few minutes to prepare for your game? Write down a strong start and ten secrets and clues the characters might discover.  
RPG tip: In dungeon delves, keep note when the players are rolling like crap and find a way to add some upward beats to keep them motivated to go forward.  
RPG tip: Mix in a good bit of non-combat encounters into your random encouters while traveling. Let the characters learn about the world through the creatures they meet.  
RPG tip: Give big monsters names that will follow the characters throughout an adventure. Ambereyes the ancient crocadile seeks revenge.  
RPG tip: Use the right combat system for the right situation. Theater of the mind works well for quick skirmishes. An elaborate map and miniatures work well for large cinematic and complicated situations. 
RPG tip: Did the characters run into a lot of money or rescue a bunch of prisoners? Use the followers and loyalty rules in the DMG to establish a home base or sailing ship full of hirelings.  
RPG tip: Add interesting monuments to random encounters so the place as as much character as the monsters.  
RPG tip: Battles aren't always about killing all of the enemies. Sometimes the goal is to stop the goblins from stealing canoes while avoiding a zombie T-rex. (miniature by Ryan Harris) 
RPG tip: Ask players to define interesting physical characteristics of monsters to draw them into the story and help you identify targets in combat.  
RPG tip: Tie interesting spell effects to magical items that make sense for the origin of the item. For example, a dwarven elemental breastplate that casts Stoneskin named Mountainhide.  
RPG tip: Tie secrets and clues to enemies with things like strange tattoos or decorative symbols on weapons or armor.  
RPG tip: Evil doesn't always wear a black hood and cloak. Evil can lurk in the hearts of the "righteous" lords who send thousands to their deaths based on ego.  
RPG tip: Sometimes, instead of straight victory, a battle instead gives the players something to learn about the story or the characters something to discover. It's not all about combat victory, sometimes it's about information.  
RPG tip: Low challenge battles are a great way for the characters to feel powerful and have opportunities to try other options.  
RPG tip: For single-session scenes, along with a strong start, have some idea where the adventure will end. It might change but keep the end in sight when there's a fixed timetable for the game.  
RPG tip: Roll on random encounter tables not necessarily to show the characters what is there but to show them what HAD been there hours or days ago.  
RPG tip: Fill your mind with fantastic fiction; books, movies, comics, and TV shows. Steep yourself in great writing and bring it forth during your game. 
RPG tip: Turn named enemies into "legendary" versions by doubling their hit points and giving them legendary actions for single attacks or cantrips and resistances.  
RPG tip: The story of a monster is more important than the monster's statistics. How does this monster act and react in the world around it? What makes it dangerous?  
RPG tip: Use fantastic specifics to describe locations. The smell of ozone. The deep rumbling in the earth. The radiating feeling of electrical dread.  
RPG tip: Some villians are most dangerous outside of combat. Only when their plans are either fully disrupted or fully in fruition will they put themselves in harm's way.  
RPG tip: Good villains think they're right in what they do. Great villains actually ARE right. 
RPG tip: A fantastic feature, a hazard, a hidden foe, and a box of treasure makes for a wonderful focused adventure scene.  
RPG tip: What agents seek out the same treasures that your characters seek? 
RPG tip: Continually switch genders of the NPCs and monsters your characters face when exploring the world. 
RPG tip: Prepare your players for the harsh possibility of character deaths. Suggest they build a stable of characters should one suddenly perish in the darkest depths of the deathtrap dungeon.  
RPG tip: Build meaningful but well-hidden treasure parsels and then move them from place to place if the characters don't find them.  
RPG tip: Aim for high fantasty and brevity when describing the locations the characters explore.  
RPG tip: Give characters a clear reason to explore dangerous locations or don't be surprised if they simply give it a miss.  
RPG tip: Write down ten bite-sized pieces of history the characters can learn when exploring a forgotten location.  
RPG tip: Get used to averaging and maxing dice damage in your head to help you streamline rolls and tweak monster damage. Avg dmg = die max + 1 * (num dice / 2). 8d6 fireball = 28 avg or 48 max. 24d10 deadly trap can be converted to 4d10 + 110. 
RPG tip: Tweak monsters but consider what these changes mean within the story. Increasing an ogre's AC from 11 to 18 is fine but describe the full plate of iron armor they now wear.  
RPG tip: Use the Dungeon Master's Guide guidelines for running a large number of foes to let your group face huge numbers of low CR monsters. Fighting fifty skeletons is fun!  
RPG tip: Prune your miniatures, maps, and 3d terrain pieces by taking out and storing those you tend not to use very often, if at all. 
RPG tip: Avoid too many battles of a similar type too close together. Don't run two large battles against hordes of monsters back to back. Shake up small skirmishes, large battles against hordes, and fights against big bosses.  
RPG tip: When running a puzzle, make sure there are logical ways the characters can figure it out. Avoid puzzles that require some external force to explain it all to them.  
RPG tip: In sandbox games, give players roughly three potential options or paths they can choose from plus any more that they come up with while hearing those options.
RPG tip: Use small simple sketches to help explain physical situations. 
RPG tip: Don't be a slave to a published adventure. If a scene doesn't work for you or the group, change it.  
RPG tip: Use small tricks to get players into the story. Have them describe killing blows. Have them identify interesting physical traits of monsters. Have them describe details of locations.  
RPG tip: worry less about the damage players roll and, if the story and energy calls for it, call it a killing blow!
RPG tip: Use passive insight and passive perception to speed up gameplay when desired. Use them to narrate scenes from the point of view of the characters.  
RPG tip: Avoid building encounters with expected outcomes. Let the characters find unique ways to deal with a situation. If they can fly over deadly pit traps, so be it.  
RPG tip: Shadar-kai from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes can be reskinned into some pretty bad-ass vampires. 
RPG tip: Keep some quick and loose encounter building guidelines in hand to improvise encounters at the general difficulty you have in mind. 
RPG tip: Integrate the story into combat. Let the characters discover interesting secrets and clues or meet new NPCs while combat rages around them.
RPG tip: Create "assassin" versions of normal monsters by boosting their dexterity and giving them stealth proficiency, Cunning Action, and Sneak Attack.
RPG tip: Make any monster a vampire by giving it regeneration, a bite attack that drains life, movement that doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and vampire vulnerabilities.
RPG tip: Random encounters can be a fun way to liven up travel instead of just combat. Flying monkeys can steal the rogue's lucky decksof cards or a curious baby triceratops can wander into camp.
RPG tip: Keep three paths open in front of the characters so they have meaningful choices that move their story forward.
RPG tip: Leap on the opportunities to add some roleplaying to combat encounters. Such scenes make battles unique and something to remember.
RPG tip: when learning from other DMs, have more questions than opinions.
RPG tip: Is the energy around the table waning? Bring some energy back into your descriptions!
RPG tip: Do you find joy when your monsters make short work of the characters? Maybe shift your view to taking joy in their victories instead.
RPG tip: DMs should know enough of the rules to keep the main game moving but needs little more. Work with the players to adjudicate when it makes sense or make a judgment and move on.
RPG tip: Want to run a shorter adventure? Stick to Theater of the Mind battles with fewer foes to keep things going smoothly.
RPG tip: help players navigate the best skill to use for a given situation and don't punish them for exploring options.
RPG tip: One-sided battles that favor the characters are just fine when they make sense for the story and give them a chance to see the organic world around them.
RPG tip: Use flavor descriptions and theatrics to keep people's imaginations on the story when running narrative "theater of the mind" combat.
RPG tip: Stay true to the tactics of monsters. Are they smart enough to know how to dive around melee to attack ranged attackers or are they a mindless hoard?
RPG tip: After a session jot down some notes, particularly where the session ended, so you know where to start when preparing for your next game.
RPG tip: If the players feel like they're being railroaded, outline some alternative options they might have missed or forgotten about.
RPG tip: Celebrate when characters circumvent combat in a creative way. Skipping a fight can be as fun as defeating it.
RPG tip: Use what the players bring to you but don't screw them with it or they will never speak up again.
RPG tip: Refresh your understanding of a monster by reviewing its background in the Monster Manual before you run it at your game.
RPG tip: Use email to interact with players regarding the individual stories of their characters between games.
RPG tip: Are you prepared to have your battle circumvented with an intersting conversation or some great stealth checks?
RPG tip: For new DMs, watch streaming #dnd games like Dice Camera Action or Critical Role to see what this strange game actually looks like when played.
RPG tip: Think about how the characters are the best ones to handle a particular situation? What traits make them the right folks for the situation at hand?
RPG tip: Action doesn't always mean combat. Keep the story moving and interesting with lots of choices and lots of momentum even when the swords are sheathed.
RPG tip: Find interesting ways to test bosses before a final encounter. Simulacrums, dreams that manifest into reality, lich-like regeneration; any of these are ways bosses can test the mettle of characters.
RPG tip: Whenever you're hard pressed for original ideas, bring in a bit of randomness and see where your mind goes. Use Donjon; the best #dnd random generator on the net. 
RPG tip: Be generous with inspiration when players roleplay their characters.
RPG tip: Take a step back when into the deep tactics of combat to describe the imagery of what's happening in the fiction.
RPG tip: Add hidden rooms and secret doors to your dungeons. If they don't find them, move the contents elsewhere.
RPG tip: Be really nice to level 1 characters and get them to level 2 after a stern conversation and a dead giant rat.
RPG tip: What was your dungeon before it was a dungeon? What was it before that? Layer history over history to enrich fantastic locations.
RPG tip: Don't bother building your own random encounters since any you don't use likely end up wasted. Instead, use random generators to give you ideas for building interesting encounters the characters are sure to run into.
RPG tip: Random encounters can be friendly parlays, meeting interesting people, or discovering hidden mysteries instead of just combat with monsters.
RPG tip: Track the various factions of NPCs in your game, villians or not. What are they up to while the characters are off on adventures? Where might they come back into play?
RPG tip: Use magic items as anchors for the story. A serpent-hilted sacrifical dagger found early on could be a key to unlocking the secrets of Dendar the Night Serpent later on.
RPG tip: Leave blanks in your story. Let the imaginations of the players fill in unsolved mysteries, even at the end of a campaign.
RPG tip: Give the players hard choices with unseen consequences. Let their own minds imagine what happens based on the decisions they make.
RPG tip: Give the characters new forward bases when they've explored deep into a land. Maybe a crashed airship can be their staging ground for a deep dungeon adventure.
RPG tip: Ask loaded questions to fill out the story of the game. "What ancient piece of civilization do you hide behind when the undead gorilla comes around?"
RPG tip: Keep the difficulty dials in mind when running combat. Feel free to tweak hit points, damage, and the number of attacks to suit the threat of the situation.
RPG tip: Use the Arcana skill to describe how a character can see into or manipulate the Weave; the web of magic that surrounds all of life. Twists, holes, and surges can reveal much of the world.
RPG tip: Study the stats and lore of the Monster Manual and then reskin to suit your own story as you need.
RPG tip: Use strange and dark rituals to restore hit points lost to life drains during the death curse from Tomb of Annihilation.
RPG tip: Think about the vertical axis in your combat encounters. What is above and below? Run battles in stark vertical climbs to change things up.
RPG tip: Drop hints at the deeper and darker world that exists beyond the horizon. What is that huge shape that stirs storms with each beat of its wings?
RPG tip: Use colorful descriptions to off-set seemingly boring monster statistics. Give them improvised abilities or let them use the environment to make them exciting.
RPG tip: Jot down character connections to the story as they occur. Review them while reviewing the characters at your next game prep session.
RPG tip: Keep a notebook handy during your game sessions. Write things down and review them after the game is over.
RPG tip: Talk to your players about them keeping game journals to tie them to the stories as they occur. Encourage them to draw pictures regardless of "skill".
RPG tip: Focus on the tools and accessories that help you run fun and flexible games.
RPG tip: Put hard decisions in front of your players but don't shut down creative Kobayashi Maru solutions that get through them.
RPG tip: 11x17 color maps are relatively cheap to print and make for great table accessories. Hit up your local print shop.
RPG tip: Physical well-made handouts can tactically tie players to the story as it goes on. Write in-character letters with fancy fonts on copper resume paper.
RPG tip: Think of dungeons as an entire set and situation the characters can thoroughly explore instead of a series of pre-defined encounters. What's happening in the whole dungeon?
RPG tip: Reckless attack and pack tactics are some great monster abilities you can drop in when you want to up the threat and when they make sense for the story and situation.
RPG tip: Describe actions using in-story narrative, not mechanical or numeric descriptions. Describe the scene, not the numbers.
RPG tip: Work on projecting your voice. Try standing. It isn't always easy but it makes a big difference.
RPG tip: Visualize the scene and situation in your mind's eye and then describe it. Take a moment to imagine things as though you were standing there.
RPG tip: Mix in low challenge monsters and encounters. Don't constantly seek challenging fights one after another.
RPG tip: Create fast and hard-hitting combat encounters by increasing damage and decreasing hit points on monsters. You can tweak monster damage within the range of the damage dice and monster hit points within the range of hit dice and still be within the design.
RPG tip: Be conscious of the amount of time things take between turns. Players should get more than 15 second turns in between eight minute rounds.
RPG tip: Don't make sausage in front of the players. Don't get into encounter design, challenge rating considerations, or what they WOULD have seen if circumstances had been different.
RPG tip: Don't hide initiative. Use table cards or fold-over initiative markers on the edge of a DM screen so everyone can see when the go in the order and can get ready.
RPG tip: Understand the capabilities and desires of the characters and set them up for success. Give polearm masters and shield masters opportunities for their benefits.
RPG tip: Ask for a player's intent when they start asking about the environment. Ask what they want to do and help them do it.
RPG tip: If it isn't clear, assume damage hits the most damaged monster. It's what we would assume smart adventurers would do anyway.
RPG tip: Each session, ask for something unique and interesting about each character. Learn together as a group what's going on within each character's story and background.
RPG tip: Use random encounters as a way to expose new information of the story. Perhaps those random kobolds know where the shrines of the trickster gods lie.
RPG tip: Frame scenes with interesting weather and the times of the day. Where is the moon in the sky? What does the sunset look like? Is there a contrail from an airship high up in the sky?
RPG tip: Each session find a way to draw in one character into their backstory. Do they run into an old friend? Have a prophetic dream? Get hunted by assassins for a crime they didn't commit?
RPG tip: Draw side-view maps and isometric maps instead of always drawing top-down. Show the height of things.
RPG tip: Give intelligent magic items their own character arc. Where did they come from? What do they want? Where are they going?
RPG tip: Give players a physical map they can mark up with a pen so it stands as an artifact to the campaign.
RPG tip: Go for a walk and think about seven tips you picked up from the last game you ran or watched.
RPG tip: Describe the in-world actions taking place during the game. Who is doing what? What happens? What does it look like? Sound like? Smell like?
RPG tip: Recommend to players that they take notes during the game. In particular, note down the names of people and places and how they relate to the characters.
RPG tip: Read up on locations around the current position of the characters. Look up places in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide and let it spawn ideas for future adventures.
RPG tip: What trade-off would make a character want to keep a curse or disease intact? What benefits does it provide that they may not want to lose?
RPG tip: Use lower numbers for the quantity and challenge ratings of random encounters. Tie them to interesting secrets and clues the characters can uncover.
RPG tip: build music playlists for relaxing, tense, and combat scenes to build the right atmosphere for the scene taking place. Witcher 3, Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2, Pillars of Eternity, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Darkest Dungeon soundtracks are awesome.
RPG tip: Encounters don't always have to lead to the central story. Some encounters, even random ones, give characters a view of the living world around them. They shouldn't be pointless but they don't have to be laser-focused either.
RPG tip: Highlight the other options for ending combat such as saving someone, capturing someone, stealing something, breaking something, staying quiet, being loud, or other such ends.
RPG tip: Keep in mind the motivations for the characters an the ways that can weave into the story. Are they trying to stop someone? Trying to save someone? Trying to make up for the past?
RPG tip: Be careful forcing high level villains against low level characters to force them into an agreement. Give them an edge that won't make them either agree or TPK.
RPG tip: Fighting hoards of low challenge monsters is a great way for mid- and high-level characters to feel awesome.
RPG tip: Stay hydrated. Always keep some water nearby when running games.
RPG tip: Find opportunities for the rogue assassin to get the drop on enemies. We're too quick to ignore surprise rounds and assassinating is their one special thing.
RPG tip: Keep options open in crucial conversations between the characters and NPCs. Always be thinking about the options available to the characters.
RPG tip: When the characters find themselves facing an insurmountable foe, always make sure they have options available to them. How can they get some sort of upper hand?
RPG tip: Remember that random encounters don't have to be combat encounters. How can the characters negotiate with those goblins?
RPG tip: If a character finds themselves in a life and death situation not necessarily of their own devices, give them a few chances at saving their lives with multiple skill checks and saving throws.
RPG tip: Build scenes and situations without necessarily assuming they will be combat, exploration, or roleplaying. Let the players decide how to approach it.
RPG tip: Be careful with tag-along NPCs overshadowing the characters in an adventure. Give NPCs a reason to stay out of the spotlight or leave the party completely. Let them defer to the characters in most scenes.
RPG tip: Build terrain setups or maps in a way that lets you store them and pull them out when you need them so you don't force any particular scene to take place.
RPG tip: Write down a list of the critical scenes you want to see take place over the course of the next few sessions.
RPG tip: Opposing factions within an enemy organization is a good way to add some interesting roleplaying and decisions to an otherwise slaughterfest.
RPG tip: Add two different and viable entrances to your dungeon to help ensure your dungeon isn't a railroad of encounters.
RPG tip: Use dieties and powerful patrons as ways to tie into a characters' backgrounds. Visions and portents from their dieties shows you care enough to remember to whom they pray.
RPG tip: Mix monsters and story-appropriate environmental effects (mad monkey mist with wights!) for an interesting multi-variable encounter.
RPG tip: If the players get stuck on a puzzle, use active or passive ability checks to drop in hints that help steer them to the right direction.
RPG tip: Dreams and hallusinations are great ways to impart secrets and clues.
RPG tip: Try using maps and table top terrain for scenes of exploration and interaction instead of just combat. Use them as a table-aid to draw your players into the story (awesome setup by @Hyperionpdx). 
RPG tip: Use the right combat style for the right job. Use Theater of the Mind for quick skirmishes. Use tactical gridded maps for difficult battles with lots of moving parts. Use abstract maps when the battle area doesn't fit cleanly onto a grid.
RPG tip: Shake up boring battles with flavorful descriptions, intriguing secrets revealed, and interesting environmental options.
RPG tip: Offer multiple solutions to most problems. Can they talk, sneak, or fight their way out?
RPG tip: Note down intelligent magic items as you would characters. How do they evolve over the campaign?
RPG tip: Always have an exit strategy for tag-along NPCs. Why does Artus Cimber and Dragonbait want to leave the group soon?
RPG tip: Golems with shield-guardian-like hit point sharing options are great ways to protect NPC wizards. An archmage with a pair of iron golems who take her damage for her is a hard foe to defeat.
RPG tip: Read through sourcebooks and adventures to fire off your imagination for your own game.
RPG tip: Read sourcebooks and adventures from other game systems. The mechanics matter little and the ideas cross system boundaries easily.
RPG tip: Read through and, if possible, try out other game systems to cross-train your DMing skills.
RPG tip: Spell descriptions contain bits of story all to themselves. The powerful spells cast by NPCs can change entire adventures. They mean as much to NPCs as PCs.
RPG tip: NPCs may have spells outside of those in the books. These might be devastating world-changing rituals that must be stopped.
RPG tip: Even if money is plentiful, expensive spell components might not be. Few 1,000 gold piece bowls exist in the world, even for those with the funds.
RPG tip: Hit points and damage are two dials we can tweak to increase or decrese the threat depending on the needs of the story. Keep these dials in mind.
RPG tip: What makes a hero? How can we tug on that concept in our D&D games? Which antiheroes in our campaign might become heroes? Which heroes might fall?
RPG tip: Find ways to shake up your game and the expectations of your players. At the same time, don't forget to keep it familiar and fun.
RPG tip: Blow up Vulcan. If your game needs to be shaken up, don't be afraid to let the meteors fall. It's your world and huge things can happen in it.
RPG tip: Write out your ten secrets for your game but then reveal them last to first. Those last secrets are often the doozies.
RPG tip: That feeling you have that you're not ready for your game and they're all going to laugh at you? We all feel that way and it's still bullshit. Carry on.
RPG tip: Take it easy on yourself. Your players want to have a fun time. You want to have a fun time. Breathe deeply and enjoy your escape to a new world.
RPG tip: Look for small ways to tweak your game and try things out. Make a large number of small changes over time. Make a small change, observe the impact, and then make another.
RPG tip: Add story-appropriate elemental damage to lower challenge monsters to make them fun tough opponents for higher level characters.
RPG tip: Constrain your game prep to a single piece of paper to get you to focus on what is most important.
RPG tip: Worry more about a monster's story and how that fits into the world than it's challenge rating.
RPG tip: Add some chaos into your strong start. Entryways collapse, temples explode, Giff show up in a steampunk spelljammer (thanks @navy_dm!).
RPG tip: Let your story drive your tools and accessories, not the other way around.
RPG tip: For a shot of inspiration, go through old boxes of miniatures or old maps and see what fires off your mind.
RPG tip: Don't punish impossible victories. Embrace them.
RPG tip: Reflavor monsters with interesting weapons and armor. Don't worry about changing the stats.
RPG tip: Build trust with your players. You are not their adversary, you are there to make their characters do awesome things.
RPG tip: Don't worry about setting a particular atmosphere. Your players will bring their own emotion to the game as it plays out. Follow the group's lead.
RPG tip: Keep a loose grip on the precision of the rules. There's a lot of flexibility built into 5e's mechanics. Allow for it.
RPG tip: Focus on what the characters will learn in the next game. Let the future of the campaign expand from this moment forward.
RPG tip: Keep an archive of your favorite maps from other adventures. Pull them out and maybe reverse them when you suddenly need a new dungeon.
RPG tip: What is the arc of the intelligent weapon in the character's hand? Where does it want to go? How will it get there?
RPG tip: Bring in NPCs that matter to the characters. Let the others fade away.
RPG tip: Telegraph what kind of adventure you're going to run. If the theme of that adventure changes, let your players know.
RPG tip: Keep campaigns short and focused on the theme of the adventure. Work with players to build characters likewise focused on that theme.
RPG tip: Write down and track the story threads that matter to the characters. Tug on them appropriately.
RPG tip: Let villains become allies and allies become villains. The line is thin between sharing a drink and sharing a blade.
RPG tip: Keep on hand the accessories that help the story unfold at the table. Note which tools help the most and which can go into deep storage.
RPG tip: Build situations and let the characters navigate them how they choose with exploration, roleplaying, or combat.
RPG tip: Always keep an eye on the time. Start managing it the minute the game starts and adjust to fit the length of your session.
RPG tip: Give dungeons, even small ones, two entrances and one secret room. It helps avoid building one-track railroad dungeons.
RPG tip: Give each room in a dungeon at least two interesting features the characters can interact with.
RPG tip: Use the appearance of skeletons to tell something about the history of the area.
RPG tip: Think of every encounter, even random monster encounters, as an opportunity for roleplaying or exploration.
RPG tip: Share the world through the eyes, backgrounds, and motivations of the characters.
RPG tip: Think about your dungeons in three dimensions. What's above and below?
RPG tip: If you have the opportunity, re-running adventures makes them much smoother the second-time around.
RPG tip: Even in the thick of running an adventure, take note of the hooks the players hand to you and use them later.
RPG tip: Don't thwart a player's unexpected idea. Embrace it.
RPG tip: Run monsters as they are in the Monster Manual. Tweak them only when you have a clear reason for it.
RPG tip: Let the characters' actions uncover secrets and clue. Maybe that last casting of shatter revealed the secret passage behind the wall.
RPG tip: Let the characters find creative ways to use the environment to their advantage. Can they use the metal-destroying shield to get past the big propeller? Maybe!
RPG tip: Foreshadow potential deadly threats with dreams, visions, and feelings of dread portents. Let the players know they're walking into a deadly situation.
RPG tip: Ensure your players are prepared for the type of game you plan to run. Will it be a deep character-introspective adventure? An action serial? A deathtrap dungeon?
RPG tip: Ensure players have spare characters if you're running a deathtrap dungeon. Tell them not to get attached.
RPG tip: Players may love the idea of hardcore deathtrap dungeons but might like to actually play them. Test them out with one-shot deathtrap dungeons.
RPG tip: Always stay within the narrative of the story. Describe what happens, not the numbers.
RPG tip: Address players by the names of their characters (thanks Dungeon World!)
RPG tip: Keep your list of random names on hand. You'll never know when someone or something, even an old memory, needs a name.
RPG tip: Visions and hazy dreams are fantastic ways to project clues or potential dangers. Adventurers are constantly getting assaulted by strange premonitions.
RPG tip: pay special attention to new players in your group. There are things they might not get that aren't obvious to you.
RPG tip: let the careful plans of the players work out as they would. Don't do mental yoga to circumvent their efforts.
RPG tip: sometimes a dented breastplate can be an awesome treasure. Add flavor to every item to make it interesting and unique.
RPG tip: size and age are two great ways to make realistic things truly fantastic.
RPG tip: use digital pictures on a tablet to show your players fantastic locations or interesting NPCs.
RPG tip: Some dungeons, even entire worlds, are characters to consider during your prep. What do they want? Where are they headed?
RPG tip: fear not throwing large amounts of enemies at your characters. Use mass combat guidelines to help you adjudicate such big battles.
RPG tip: Focus on the start of your next session. What will draw your players into the game and let them know they're hip-deep in D&D?
RPG tip: Give the players time to plot and plan their approach. Sometimes such plans go off as expected and sometimes unforeseen variables throw them into chaos.
RPG tip: Always keep an eye out for new members to join your group. Even if your group is perfectly healthy, a substitute player always helps and you never know if real life will tear someone away.
RPG tip: Expose the history of the world through the backgrounds of the characters. What do THEY know of the strange god-like beings depicted in the frescoes on the wall?
RPG tip: Customize monsters with unique armor, weapons, and spells. Give them interesting tattoos, scars, or battle insignias.
RPG tip: Describe how characters passively perceive something. Do they see cobwebs blowing in a breeze that shouldn't be there?
RPG tip: Immerse yourself in the fantastic. Play games, read books, watch great TV shows and movies, soak up fantasy artwork, read fantasy poetry; fill your brain with fantasy.
RPG tip: Mix up weapons and armor types among humanoid monsters to make them all feel unique and interesting.
RPG tip: When a player drops a story element on you, like an NPC from their past, grab it and run with it even if you don't know where it will end up. The story will happen on its own.
RPG tip: Ask players to reiterate their goals in an adventure. Let the other players fill those goals in. If none of them can remember, that's trouble.
RPG tip: Keep character and NPC backgrounds light hearted. Not everyone needs to come from a slaughtered village or a bloody altar under a gnoll's knife. Sometimes they come from a family of sixteen.
RPG tip: Ask players specific questions about their characters and listen to what they give you. What did they see in their uncle that got them to start adventuring? What inspiration did they take from their mother's book?
RPG tip: Be prepared for character conversations to go surprisingly well or surprisingly poorly. Not every meeting with a lich ends in death. Sometimes it ends with tea.
RPG tip: Need inspiration? Grab the Dungeon Master's Guide off the shelf with some dice, read, and roll some random ideas to see what shakes up your world.
RPG tip: Take note of the pets of the characters. In many ways players love their pets as much as their PCs.
RPG tip: Be careful with character arcs. Some players have a clear path they wan to take and shaking it up too much can ruin their fun. Ask them what they want from their PC.
RPG tip: Study whole dungeons in published adventures thoroughly and you'll have a much easier time preparing from session to session as the characters navigate it.
RPG tip: Roll on random tables ahead of time so you don't tip your hand showing that the world is just some random nonsense you're coming up with at the table.
RPG tip: Simplify puzzles on the fly if they get boring or tedious. Let skill checks reveal things the players might have missed.
RPG tip: Reveal the purpose and origin of a dungeon through it's visible details and construction.
RPG tip: Players enjoy dominating what could have been a tough fight. Don't rob them of the easy victory.
RPG tip: We get to choose whether to embrace fantasy with either childish wonder or adult cynicism. Open your eyes wide, smile, and be a kid again.
RPG tip: Write down notes on your last game as close to the game as you can while it's fresh in your head.
RPG tip: Who are the characters? What is the strong start? What are ten secrets they might discover in the next session?
RPG tip: Add some single-use relics to spice up treasure boards without overpowering your characters. 
RPG tip: Inspire yourself with art.
RPG tip: Use a mix of props, printouts, music, and narrative to paint a picture in all dimensions.
RPG tip: End sessions at the start of a major encounter to start strong at your next game.
RPG tip: Focus on the tools that help you create the story at the table.
RPG tip: Relax, breathe deep, you're game is going to be great.
RPG tip: Keep your DM kit small and flexible to let your game go in directions you haven't thought of. You need little more than a white board and a marker.
RPG tip: Let music inspire your ideas. Put on some of your favorite tunes, close your eyes, and let the images come to you.
RPG tip: Hypothesize, experiment, and think about the results. Try stuff out and tune based on your experiences.
RPG tip: Explore randomness as a seed for new story directions.
RPG tip: Think about the theme of your campaign and how you express it to your players.
RPG tip: Be careful with effects that take away actions from characters. They can really bum players out. Give them options. Maybe they take psychic damage to steel themselves and get back into the fight.
RPG tip: The only way you'll really know if your players are ok with character deaths is to see how they act when characters die. It can be fun for one-shots but might suck in longer story-focused games
RPG tip: Remember that spell effects occur in three dimensions. One can shrink the diameter of a fireball by casting it higher up in the air.
RPG tip: Read up on a monster's background and lore before you run it. The stories of a monster can inspire new ideas when you roleplay them.
RPG tip: Even in combat scenes, it's worth knowing what a monster wants or what it needs. Some of the best roleplaying negotiations can happen in combat.
RPG tip: Break away from your typically story-focused narrative game with a really interesting tactical battle.
RPG tip: Read body language to see what's working and what is not when you're running your game. Are they leaning forward or sitting back, arms crossed, and eyes narrowed?
RPG tip: Let go of the tactics and mechanics of your game and lose yourself in the world of fantasy and the story of your game.
RPG tip: Embrace what's fun for the group and run with it.
RPG tip: Drop circumstances, both lucky and unlucky, into the story. Watch what happens.
RPG tip: Use maps, terrain, and miniatures to show off scenes of exploration and roleplaying instead of just combat.
RPG tip: Include two entrances and one secret room in dungeons you design.
RPG tip: Cursed magic items are tricky to inject. Think about how they may come into play, how not to overplay your hand, and how to ensure they're fun and not a drag.
RPG tip: Cursed magic items are tricky to inject. Think about how they may come into play, how not to overplay your hand, and how to ensure they're fun and not a drag.
RPG tip: If your players are getting bored, speed up the pace. If they're getting frustrated, give them a boon. Oscillate the beats between hope and fear.
RPG tip: Give the characters a one-use item of power well beyond them. Let them shake the game up in an exciting way.
RPG tip: Don't fear for your monsters. You have an infinite supply.
RPG tip: Read rooms in published adventures ahead of time. Cut or modify the ones that don't excite you.
RPG tip: Run published adventures more than once if you have the chance. Nothing solidifies a published adventure in your mind like actually running it.
RPG tip: Sit back and enjoy it when the players are talking strategies among one another. It means they're fully engaged in what is going on.
RPG tip: Keep an initiative order even if the party is split. It helps ensure you're giving each character enough time in the spotlight.
RPG tip: Telepathic villains are a great way to torment the characters anywhere they happen to be.
RPG tip: Let the players break the game with particularly good combinations of powers or abilities. Don't let that particular game breaking quality become the new norm.
RPG tip: Insert roleplaying into combat. Villains love to banter with their enemies during a fight.
RPG tip: Even the walls in a dungeon tell a story. What do yours tell?
RPG tip: The limitless depth of an Abolith's memories are a fantastic way to bring ancient histories to the characters.
RPG tip: What character options make your campaign interesting? What makes your campaign unique for them?
RPG tip: Foreshadow dangers in dungeons with smells and feelings.
RPG tip: Let the story unfold at the table.
RPG tip: A single charm person can subvert a battle against one hundred foes. And that's awesome.
RPG tip: Acererak has a lot on his mind. He might miss the small detail of his succubus lawyer getting charmed by the bard.
RPG tip: Acererak doesn't hate the characters. He doesn't think about them at all. They are insects hardly worthy of the neurons to consider (does Acererak have neurons?)
RPG tip: Before you shut down a player's bullshit tactic, is it actually an awesome turn in the story?
RPG tip: Ask your players what they are and are not comfortable with in the game during your session zero. Pay attention to body language during the game as well; you might have missed something.
RPG tip: Let go of your pre-definition of a scene. Combat can become roleplay, roleplay can become investigation, investigation can become combat. Create a situation and let the players define their interaction with it.
RPG tip: Work with the players whenever it helps move the story forward. They don't always need to roll a skill check to succeed.
RPG tip: Let players negotiate out of potential combat. Not every conflict requires a fight.
RPG tip: Worry less about the tactics and focus on the players' intent. What do they want to do with those eight summoned constrictor snakes? Focus on that.
RPG tip: Fewer players give you more of an opportunity to let those characters shine. Try to aim for four or five PCs when you're able.
RPG tip: Simple adventures are just fine. Don't worry about including a lot of twists and turns. Sometimes a straight forward but flavorful adventure is all players desire.
RPG tip: Even if they can't do anything with it, finding a 10,000 gp gem in the bottom of a killer dungeon is fun. Tangible rewards matter.
RPG tip: Try to reward one meaningful magical item to each character every four levels or so. It doesn't need to be perfectly systematic but that's about the right overall pace.
RPG tip: Address the characters, not the players.
RPG tip: Describe fantastic locations.
RPG tip: Find a way to help characters shine even if the dice are against them.
RPG tip: Let characters stray away from what you've prepared if it makes sense in the story. Prepare to let them wander.
RPG tip: Display maps and artwork on tablets to show the players what's going on.
RPG tip: High skill checks don't just show them what they can do but what they certainly can't do.
RPG tip: Tie magic items to the story of the adventure and location. Why is it here?
RPG tip: Let characters spend time figuring out puzzles. If they're all engaged, the game is going well.
RPG tip: Remove extranous combat. Maybe the goblins were killed by something else wandering around the dungeon.
RPG tip: One need not run gridded combat in Roll 20. General positioning on a cool background can work for quick combat.
RPG tip: Sometimes it's fun when a monster is down to a single hit point. Sometimes it's better to round down.
RPG tip: Vivid descriptions of high action help ensure that theater of the mind combat doesn't feel stale and static. Focus on the fiction.
RPG tip: Have some cool maps? Use them as inspiration for your fantastic locations.
RPG tip: Building a huge campaign? Consider focusing first on the characters and their immediate surroundings.
RPG tip: Your next game matters the most.
RPG tip: Huge epic miniatures work well as centerpiece statues, monuments, or displays in low level games.
RPG tip: Did a character leave the story and then return? Bring the player in to fill in what happened.
RPG tip: Foreshadowing can come in many guises. Faded images on the wall, haunted dreams, the curious look of a stranger. Everything can be a message.
RPG tip: Prepare enough to feel comfortable letting the characters explore the dungeon however they choose.
RPG tip: Modify a published encounter to fit the most enjoyable pacing of the game. Make it easier or harder to fit the current atmosphere at the table.
RPG tip: Sometimes you'll want the most elaborate battle environment you can  build. Other times a circle on a piece of paper is all you need.
RPG tip: Reskin spells to fit the flavor of the casters.
RPG tip: Keep musical playlists for suspense, relaxed, and combat scenes.
RPG tip: Spend the time to prepare big boss fights. We can improvise a lot of our game but boss fights require careful planning.
RPG tip: Build solid mechanics in your boss fights and include gauges you can turn to raise or lower the threat as needed.
RPG tip: Do your traps and puzzles make logical sense or do they simply require random selections to pass them?
RPG tip: What does your villain want? What are they doing to try to get it?
RPG tip: What makes your town or village fantastic? What features does it have that sets it apart and grabs the attention of the players?
RPG tip: Always be learning.
RPG tip: Stay in the fiction. Describe what's happening in the world.
RPG tip: Never forget that the characters are the heroes of your story. Your universe revolves around them.
RPG tip: What drives the characters to dive into your adventure? Why do they care? What do they want?
RPG tip: Remind players to leave gaps in their backstories so they can grow into their characters as the adventures move onward.
RPG tip: Easy hacks for the fantastic: go big and go old. 
RPG tip: Mash the defining traits of one stat block with another to build something completely unique. Ghoul assassin! Stone giant lich! Goblin veteran! Pick one for base stats and steal defining traits from another.
RPG tip: Beholders likely have large physical minions who punch the concentration out of spellcasters while they're within the antimagic cone. Helmed Horrors and Shield Guardians would be particularly nasty against invisible opponents.
RPG tip: Pay special attention to preparing boss battles. They're not like other encounters. Add dials to change the pacing and difficulty while running the encounter at the table.
RPG tip: Evolve! Take in new experiences and ideas and nudge your DMing style in new directions. Don't throw out the past and don't let the past close you off to new ideas. 
RPG tip: Plant seeds early on in an adventure so confrontations with boss battles aren't just straight-up fights. What do the characters possess that the villains greatly desire?
RPG tip: As you close in on the end of a campaign, ask the players what remains in their characters' arcs that have yet to be resolved.
RPG tip: As a campaign ends, ask the characters where their characters have gone and what they've done one year later. Write it down and email it around as a remembrance.
RPG tip: It's ok to have a planned end to a campaign. Let the players' imaginations fill in the future of their characters after it closes.
RPG tip: Don't negate a character's big special ability. Let them enjoy their broken power in monumental scenes.
RPG tip: When the characters have tough choices ahead, make it clear what those choices are. Don't let them get steered too far away from success or it can get frustrating.
RPG tip: Gauge your players' tolerance for character deaths. Do they like it? Do they hate it? You'll only really know when it happens but keep an eye out for it.
RPG tip: Go easy on first level characters. Watch the damage the monsters do carefully. Ignore instant death if you want to be nice to new players.
RPG tip: Keep meaningful NPCs down to about three in any given adventure. Too many and players lose track of them too easily.
RPG tip: Challenge rating is one way to get a general gage of a monster's actual challenge but its hit points and damage output are also important to consider.
RPG tip: Your most important session is your next one.
RPG tip: Build layers in your locations. What is it now? What did it used to be?
RPG tip: Understand and reinforce the themes in your campaign. Describe them in your session zero to ensure your players are on board. Is it dark fantasy? Urban intrigue? Jungle exploration? What defines the theme?
RPG tip: Sometimes all you need are two ogres in the woods to see how your players want to interact with the world. Will they attack them? Will they trick them? Will they sneak around them? Will they listen to them? Leave the approach open and build situations instead. 
RPG tip: Stopping the dark ritual at the end of a campaign is a poor motivation. Gathering the items to contain the result is a more interesting goal. 
RPG tip: Take the time to read about the lore of a character's background or origin. Are they elvish? Read the lore about the Fey. Do they have a connection to the Shadowfell? Read about the history of Shadar-Kai. 
RPG tip: Stringing characters along the quest to acquire an item they cannot attain can be demotivating and frustrating. Instead, let them gather clues to understand and face the perils ahead. 
RPG tip: In early levels, pay particular attention to the damage monsters inflict. It can surprise you how quickly a low level character can go from full hit points to zero. 
RPG tip: Dreams and visions are a fantastic way to foreshadow events happening later in the game. They can introduce villains. They can answer questions. They can make the ethereal true. 
RPG tip: Need inspiration to draw your players into the action of the game? Review the skill list in chapter 7 of the Player's Handbook and see all of the things they can do with skills.
RPG tip: Make sure your players are on board with the theme of your campaign. It's worth a series of conversations even before your session zero.
RPG tip: Know the structure of your short campaign. You don't have to fill in all the details but a general outline helps.
RPG tip: What interesting magic items might your characters discover in your next adventure?
RPG tip: Don't be afraid to give powerful single-use magic items. They can add some chaotic fun without completely breaking an entire campaign. 
RPG tip: Oscillate between easy and hard battles to change up the beats in your game.
RPG tip: Don't kill off NPCs just to get an emotional reaction out of your players. You can put them in danger and the situation may kill them but don't force the conclusion.
RPG tip: The night of or the morning after your game, spend ten minutes writing down what happened in the last session.
RPG tip: Some moments in the game will surprise everyone at the table, including you. Let them happen. These are the surprises everyone will remember long after the campaign is over.
RPG tip: Build story ideas from old mythological folklore. Seek out Celtic, Greek, African, Native American, Chinese, Middle Eastern, and Authorian legends.
RPG tip: Put in longer moments of rest in between adventures. Ask what the characters did in between these sessions. Let players develop their characters so you and the rest of the players can understand them better.
RPG tip: Build a structure around your game that you and your players understand. The characters must seek four breakers-magical artifacts capable of destroying the four anchors that bring the Demon Lord to Urth.
RPG tip: Good campaign arcs have a single sentence that defines them. Even if the world is wide hope, the players and characters understand their overall goal.
RPG tip: Build one fantastic location for every 30 to 45 minutes of expected gameplay. What is it called? What three aspects does it have that will interest the characters?
RPG tip: Build out what the characters will see and what is just over the horizon.
RPG tip: Keep the characters at the center of your game prep.
RPG tip: Delegate rules responsibility to your players. You need not carry that burden by yourself.
RPG tip: Break canon.
RPG tip: Absorb great fiction and use it to build the texture in your own game.
RPG tip: Understand and reinforce the theme of your campaign.
RPG tip: Take a sharpie and mark the rules in your book that have been updated with errata. Fear not writing in your books. Remember the potions book of the Half-Blood Prince.
RPG tip: What is the mythology of your world?
RPG tip: Fill your mind with the words and images of the fantastic.
RPG tip: Try out a short campaign in which the characters level every session.
RPG tip: Let go.
RPG tip: Shrink your aperture.
RPG tip: Leave loose ends loose.
RPG tip: Watch their body language.
RPG tip: Attack with a horde.
RPG tip: Reduce your tools.
RPG tip: Simplify.
RPG tip: Attack in waves.
RPG tip: Deep caverns lie beneath every gnarled tree.
RPG tip: Build on the bones of dead gods.
RPG tip: Cut off passages and chambers in a dungeon on the fly if it better fits the timing and pacing of the adventure you're running.
RPG tip: Take the time to select or build intersting magic items. They matter a lot to your players.
RPG tip: Balance lore and action. Don't just tell them stuff, let them discover it.
RPG tip: Look to the DM's Guild for interesting playtested character options that fit the theme of your campaign. Players would love to expand beyond the PhB.
RPG tip: Crosstrain with other RPGs. Pick up tips from these other RPGs. What are your favorites?
RPG tip: Let the players fill in the timeline gaps in your stories with their own descriptions of their character's time off screen.
RPG tip: Let the story shift direction based on what the players remember and focus their attention on. What do they care about?
RPG tip: Instead of spending a lot of time building a custom monster, reskin an existing one.
RPG tip: Looking for an interesting variant of a monster, like a wererat assassin? Stick to the normal assassin stat block and reflavor it as a wererat.
RPG tip: Ensure your dungeon design makes sense for the story.
RPG tip: Ensure there's a purpose for a puzzle room. Most lichs likely don't build rooms just to challenge adventurers.
RPG tip: Worry less about designing a location and its inhabitants around the current power level of the characters. Give them one that makes sense given the current story.
RPG tip: Rule number one for running narrative combat: Help characters succeed with their intent.
RPG tip: The general flow of narrative "theater of the mind" combat: describe the environment and situation, ask the player for their desire and intent, adjudicate the results favoring the character. Repeat.
RPG tip: Let monsters act in a non-optimized way if the pace of battle calls for it. Just because a bullywug can swim doesn't mean players want to chase it for six rounds.
RPG tip: Above all, stay on time. Watch your time throughout the whole adventure. Let players end on a high note. Don't "call it right here".
RPG tip: Its perfectly fine to play sub-optimally for the fun of the story and the pace of the game.
RPG tip: Describe what the characters are seeing or what is happening to them before asking for a roll. Ask that players likewise describe their actions.
RPG tip: There's a fine line between a challenging fight and an annoying one. Keep a careful eye on it so you don't cross it.
RPG tip: Work with your players, not against them. Help them succeed.
RPG tip: Get as close to you can to asking "what do you do?" Give players options often.
RPG tip: Just like campaigns, individual adventures can have an overall theme. Paint your adventure from this theme.

RPG tip: Flavor the details of your location with historical statues, frescoes, and other markings that expand the history of your campaign.

RPG tip: Increase the damage of monsters to make them scarier and increase the tension.
RPG tip: Bathe locations in iconic imagery. A collapsed building that seemed to form a giant screaming skull. A twisted tower that looks like a single finger pointing up to a dead sky. A deep pit that looks like a seeping wound in the earth.
RPG tip: Introduce villains early and keep them present, even if just in rumor or the aftermath of their crossing.
RPG tip: Describe world-changing events that may take place off screen to give the players a view of a living world.
RPG tip: Stuck for inspiration? Start with five to seven fantastic locations and see what ideas they bring to you.

RPG tip: A boss arriving later in a battle is a good way to avoid them getting alpha-striked in round one of a battle.
RPG tip: Inflicting damage when hit is a great way to scale threat with the number of characters. An ancient red dragon with fireshield is a truly deadly experience.

RPG tip: Improvise the actions and reactions of the characters as though they're balls on a pool table. Who can say where they're going to go until they start moving.
RPG tip: Keep a few basic monsters at your current challenge level available to reskin when you need a creature you haven't thought of. Ogres and giants work particularly well.

RPG tip: Nothing is more stressful than a villainous garden party you can't simply burn down.

RPG tip: Illusions that affect some characters but not others is a great way to add some inter-party suspense and fun roleplaying for your players.
RPG tip: Villains have all sorts of motivations. Some may not realize they're villains at all. What if an innocent person might cause the end of the world?
RPG tip: Add your own folklore to your campaign. A black dagger might be a shard cut from the fabric of the night sky.
RPG tip: Give yourself time to run boss battles. Expect them to take at least twice as long as a typical battle. Give them the bandwidth they deserve.

RPG tip: Take some time to understand the capabilities of the characters. Talk to your players about the choices they've made for their character and what they hope to see them do.
RPG tip: Email microfiction to keep the players playing the game even when they're not at the table.
RPG tip: Email a campaign closer that talks about the state of the world six months after the characters finished the campaign. How has the world changed due to their heroic actions?

RPG tip: In complicated situations players are probably in trouble understanding what's going on about half the time. Keep this in mind and help them out.

RPG tip: The world is built upon the ancient remains of a thousand civilizations.

RPG tip: Spend ten minutes before your game going over the characters. Who are they? What do they want? What do they like to do?
RPG tip: Steal bigger dungeons, particularly dungeon maps, from other published adventures if you're worried the characters will take a dungeon path you didn't expect.
RPG tip: Make sure the characters have something to do in each of the locations they might explore. Otherwise they'll just wander through.
RPG tip: Reward curiosity.

RPG tip: Before you plan out your campaign, talk to your players and make sure its the sort of campaign people want to play. Do this even BEFORE a session zero (session negative one?)

RPG tip: Add or remove encounters to change up the pace of the game. Too many battles can be weary and too few can lose the action
RPG tip: Add magic items that fit the backgrounds and desires of the characters. Let's face it, Sting was made for Bilbo.
RPG tip: Let confrontations go from verbal to physical and maybe back again. Don't expect or force a scene to go one way or the other. Let the players choose.
RPG tip: Write a one-page campaign summary that focuses on the characters and their role in the campaign. Write it in the second person.
RPG tip: Use hand torn crumpled copper resume paper to make cool in world  notes.
RPG tip: Keep your session zero relaxed and let your players know not to expect crazy powerhouse action. It's a time to get to know the characters and the world.

RPG tip: Nothing beats a body washing up on shore to start a mystery.
RPG tip: Change the hooks in published adventures if the one in your head will grab your players more than the one in the book.
RPG tip: Make vampires more dangerous by increasing their life draining bite to 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and requiring Greater Restoration to restore the drained hit points.

RPG tip: Zombies that explode like fireballs when they finally die.
RPG tip: Block and schedule some time in your week to spend real time preparing for your game.
RPG tip: Award inspiration to reward risk taking that moves the story forward. Putting your head into a well full of poisonous snakes? You get inspiration!

RPG tip: Keep an eye on the damage output of a monster. It may swing harder or softer than the challenge rating indicates.
RPG tip: Drop hints of interesting things the characters might otherwise miss. Strange thudding noises in the attic, strange glowing shining reflections in the mud at the bottom of the well.
RPG tip: Tie the PCs' backgrounds to future adventures. Maybe one of the characters sailed on the ship that sunk the pirate vessel Tammeraut.
RPG tip: Build handouts to draw players into the world. Strange fonts on copper-colored resume paper with torn edges works well.

RPG tip: Review the material on the DM screen every so often to refresh you on the tools you have right in front of you.
RPG tip: Keep track of character hit points so you can get a more accurate gauge of monster difficulty.

RPG tip: Use larger encounter areas with a few rooms. Monsters can come from many sides and the characters might need to split up to keep them at bay.

RPG tip: Even if you only have ten minutes to prepare for your game, spend those ten minutes on the most important elements of your game prep: Who are the characters? Where will it start? What secrets and clues might they discover?
RPG tip: Even rot grub swarms have interesting physical characteristics that separate them from other rot grub swarms (little mohawks, spiral stripes, ugly spots).
RPG tip: Even in open sandbox scenarios, it helps to clarify what the characters can and can't do. Give some guidelines so they're not completely flailing.
RPG tip: Are the players smiling? You're doing it right.
RPG tip: When putting a big scenario in front of your players, like infiltrating a villa or invading a pirate ship, take the time to understand all of the variables. How will the NPCs act? Where are they going? What do they want?
RPG tip: Clarify when the characters have exhausted all the information they're going to get in a scene. "You're pretty sure you've learned everything you can here."
RPG tip: Let the players discover the number of enemies they're likely to face in a big dynamic area. How many hill giants can they expect to find in the steading of the hill giant chief?
RPG tip: Sometimes skill checks go so catastrophically wrong that it shakes up the whole world. A simple attempted distraction might capsize an entire ship.
RPG tip: Help guide the players' discussion of their plans for an infiltration or ruse. Steer the conversation towards what will likely work, away from what won't, and towards what will bring the most fun for the group.
RPG tip: Hide your secret villains from the characters and leave clues of their existence and their impact on the surrounding world.
RPG tip: In any open situation offer three plausable paths plus any the players come up with themselves.

RPG tip: End with a cliffhanger and give yourself a built-in strong start next game.
RPG tip: Before running any monster, give its lore section in the monster manual a read and see if it fires up any ideas.
RPG tip: Perhaps a malenti, a sahuagin spy and assassin who appears as a sea elf, has infiltrated the local lizardfolk lair as a false ambassador with plans to assassinate the queen.

RPG tip: A few miniatures on the table just to show general positioning can help players better understand how a battle is going.
RPG tip: Understand how the action economy affects combat difficulty. The number of actions on each side compared to the ither matters a lot. Four on four is much more balanced than one on four.

RPG tip: Foreshadow your adventures with sinister weather or the attitudes of the crowds.
RPG tip: Run small experiments.
RPG tip: Keep your descriptions in the fiction. Don't describe mechanics, describe the story behind them. "You take 8 damage" becomes "The orc's greatsword slashes across your thigh leaving a weeping wound. You take 8 damage."
RPG tip: 500 word bits of flash fiction is a great way to give the characters a glimpse of what happened before. Ship's logs, letters, journals; give them a small taste of the larger story.
RPG tip: In longer mysteries, hold back incriminating evidence until it's time for the discovery.
RPG tip: The warlock's relationship with their patron is a complex one. It can be just as antagonistic as the strength of its bond. Warlocks are not slaves to their patrons.
