## Contents

This zip file contains three files:

"README.txt" (this file) with instructions and license information.

"dnd_tip_tweet_archive.csv" which contains original #dnd tips and dates from Twitter going back to 2009. These tips include D&D 4e specific tips and is likely less useful.

"rpg_tips_archive.txt" the current archive, beginning around 2015 with D&D 5th edition. These tips tend to be more useful for TTRPGs overall.
